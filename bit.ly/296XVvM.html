                <p>What is Gang Stalking?</p>
<p>A Simple Definition</p>
<p>Under Occupational Health and Safety laws, individuals are being flagged  and placed on community notification lists. This is happening without  the targets knowledge. In many countries these community notifications  are being used by companies and others to target innocent individuals  such as whistle-blowers, the outspoken, etc. In conjunction with these  notifications, companies and others are in some cases using a practice  that was used in the former soviet union called the psychiatric  reprisal. This is used as a means of retaliation, blacklisting,  silencing, or controlling members of society. Once on the notification  system, warnings about the targets are sent out to every individual the  target comes in contact with, thus poisoning their associations, and  socially annexing the targeted individual.</p>
<p>Full Definition</p>
<p>Gang Stalking is a systemic form of control, which seeks to destroy every aspect of a Targeted Individuals life. Once a target is <a title="Under community health and safety programs, which most countries now have in place, a person can be flagged for various reasons. Once flagged a notification about the target is distributed to the community. They have a right to know if someone has displayed various types of behaviours that could cause them harm." href="http://www.wcb.pe.ca/photos/original/wcb_wpviolence.pdf" target="newwin"><span style="color:#bb0000;">flagged</span></a> a notification is sent out to the community at large, and the target is followed around 24/7 by the various communities that they are in.</p>
<p>The community notifications will go out to various places. Apartment rentals, future employers, stores and communities where the target visits, will be notified. Doctors offices, fire departments, police, etc. A covert investigation might also be opened, and <a title="The 1/2 Hz sensory resonance affects the autonomic nervous system and may cause relaxation, drowsiness, or sexual excitement, depending on the precise acoustic frequency near 1/2 Hz used." href="http://www.targetedindividuals.com/Forum/showthread.php?tid=153" target="newwin"><span style="color:#bb0000;">electronic</span></a>, means used by the civilian spies/snitches as part of the overt and covert monitoring and surveillance process.</p>
<p>Individuals can be flagged designating them as having a history of aggressive or inappropriate behavior. This notification system will follow the target if they move, change jobs, visit other areas. It let&#8217;s the community believe that the target is a person who needs to be watched or monitored.</p>

<p>The identity of the person and the nature of the risk must be given to staff likely to come into contact with that person. While workers have the right to know the risks, it is important to remember that this information cannot be indiscriminately distributed.</p></blockquote>
<p>A woman named Jane Clift in the U.K. went through a very similar type of flagging system. A warning marker was placed against her name designating her as potentially violent.</p>

<p>Individuals are being flagged without their knowledge. In many countries these community notifications might fall under <a title="The identity of the person and the nature of the risk must be given to staff likely to come into contact with that person. While workers have the right to know the risks, it is important to remember that this information cannot be indiscriminately distributed." href="http://www.wcb.pe.ca/photos/original/wcb_wpviolence.pdf" target="newwin"><span style="color:#bb0000;">community safety and health laws.</span></a> It seems that employers, educational facilities, and community centers are in some cases flagging innocent individuals as a means of <a title="They both are victims of an increasingly popular employer weapon against whistleblowers: the psychiatric reprisal." href="http://www.harassment101.com/Article5.html"><span style="color:#bb0000;">retaliation,</span></a> silencing, or controlling members of society.</p>

<blockquote><p>Maria Buffa, a former salaried employee in the personnel department at Ford World Headquarters in Dearborn, Michigan, said she, too, was sent to a psychiatrist after she filed a sexual harassment complaint in February 1999 against a woman co-worker. &#8220;You think, maybe I am the problem, else why would they be sending me to a psychiatrist,&#8221; she said. The psychiatrist Ford selected, Dr. Edward Dorsey of Midwest Health Center, made a report that said the only psychiatric symptom Buffa displayed was anxiety. Dorsey&#8217;s report said that the referral came from Ford&#8217;s medical department and was at least in part due to her <span style="text-decoration:underline;">complaints of sexual harassment.</span> He also noted that the Ford doctor who referred Buffa cited a couple of &#8220;incidents&#8221;: She was seen yelling at someone, and she had shown up at a fitness center &#8220;wearing less than the usual amount of clothing for that physical activity.&#8221;</p>
<p>In April 1999, Buffa&#8217;s boss fired her &#8220;for the good of the company,&#8221; she recalled being told.</p></blockquote>
<p><a title="They both are victims of an increasingly popular employer weapon against whistleblowers: the psychiatric reprisal." href="http://www.harassment101.com/Article5.html"><span style="color:#bb0000;">Psychiatric Reprisal</span></a></p>
<p>The individual is then placed under overt and covert forms of surveillance. Everywhere the Targeted Individual goes, their name is <a href="http://www.intecpublicsector.com/system/files/Violent%20Person%20Register%20-%20InCheck%20Guidance.pdf" target="newwin"><span style="color:#bb0000;">flagged.</span></a> In a big city this could mean that thousands upon thousands of people are getting a notification about the target. The person is followed around 24/7. Foot patrols and vehicle patrols are used to follow the Individual around, as part of the monitoring process. During these patrols a <a href="https://gangstalking.wordpress.com/2010/02/informant-signals" target="newwin"> <span style="color:#bb0000;">one handed sign language</span></a> is used to assist the citizen informants with communicating to each other. They will use this to silently communicate to any business the target enters, or other areas.</p>
<p><a href="https://gangstalking.wordpress.com/2010/02/informant-signals" target="_blank">http://gangstalkingworld.com/Media/2010/02/informant-signals</a></p>
<p>Gang Stalking is experienced by the Targeted Individual as psychological attack, that is capable of immobilizing and destroying them over time. The covert methods used to harass, persecute, and falsely defame the targets often leave no evidence to incriminate the civilian spies.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s similar to workplace mobbing, but takes place outside in the community. It called Gang Stalking, because groups of organized community members stalk and monitor the targets 24/7.</p>
<p>Many Targeted Individuals are flagged, harassed and placed under surveillance in this way for months or even years before they realize that they are being targeted by an organized protocol of harassment.</p>
<p>What happens during this monitoring and surveillance is very similar to what happened to many innocent individuals in the former East Germany or Activists and Dissidents in Russia. Many innocent people in the former East Germany would be targeted by the state, and then their friends, family, and the community at large would be used to monitor, prosecute, and harass them. The same persecutions and harassment&#8217;s are now happening in democratic countries.</p>
<p>Once a person is flagged or has a warning marker placed on their file, the community becomes hypervigilant, and within this structure there is a targeted and illegal protocol of harassment that happens. Electronic means are used to monitor, harass and torture the target. When the target tries to describe what is happening to them, it sounds as if they have had a mental breakdown. The reality is electronic means are being used to make it appear as if the target has had a breakdown.</p>

<p>In Russia similar means were used by the state to declare activist, dissidents or anyone they thought to be an enemy of the state as mentally unfit and many were institutionalized using this form of systemic control.</p>
<p>The closest thing to Gang Stalking that democratic countries have seen before this is McCarthyism, Cointelpro, and RED SQUAD programs. Red Squad programs were used for monitoring, and harassment of various groups. They have been in place for over a hundred years, and they also employed Informants.</p>
<p>Civilian Spies, who can also be termed &#8220;Covert Human Intelligence Sources&#8221; come from every level and sector of society. Remember anyone the Targeted Individual comes into contact with gets a warning about the target.</p>
<p>Just like with Cointelpro investigations, everyone in the targets life is contacted, advised as to why the individual has been flagged, advised not to discuss the notification and asked to be a part of the ongoing, never ending monitoring (systemic psychological harassment and manipulation of the target) process. This process is covertly designed to control the targets, keep them in line, or destroy the target over time, leaving them with no form of support.</p>
<p>These actions are specifically designed to mimic a psychological operation. This psychological harassment of the target is designed to destroy them over years, making them look crazy and leave them with no form of support. The individuals around the target carry out actions and tasks as they are instructed, without realizing that the structure is psychologically designed to break the target down.</p>
<p>Worldwide programs of control and conformity have been used with equal success and lethality. What we are seeing now is a co-ordinated and organized effort of control and conformity. Many countries around the world are currently using a model of policing called: Community Oriented Policing. It&#8217;s described as a systemic approach to policing. It focuses on instilling a sense of community within a geographically located neighborhood. Communities come together and discuss what values they would like to have in their community, community development, and it&#8217;s also a time to discuss any problems that might be happening in a specific area. If a problem is identified an investigation might be opened. These local programs in many countries have been forming partnerships with other government run programs at, <a title="With agents going undercover, state and local police coordinate their online activities with the Secret Service, FBI and other federal agencies in a strategy known as “deconfliction” to keep out of each other’s way." href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-20000550-38.html"><span style="color:#bb0000;">provincial, state and federal</span></a> levels. A process called <a href="http://www.eff.org/files/filenode/social_network/20100303__crim_socialnetworking.pdf" target="newwin"><span style="color:#bb0000;">Deconfliction</span></a> allows them to share information. Reports of Gang Stalking are not only coming in from democratic countries, but they are coming in from many other countries as well.</p>

<p>The modern day systemic form of control could only be funded at governmental levels, just like it has in other societies where these similar types of harassment programs have been implemented. It&#8217;s all part of a system of control and conformity that has been in place for many years. A system of control with many local groups and appendages taking part. Many targets report that their information is passed and shared between country boarders, and that the surveillance continues even when they travel.</p>
<p>What are the goals of Gang Stalking?</p>
<p>The official goal is listed as a notification for the community, to alert them of individuals who have been flagged, or have had a warning marker placed on their file. It&#8217;s officially used as a means of investigating or monitoring individuals who have displayed inappropriate, or violent behaviours. The real goal in some cases however seems to be to isolate the target from all forms of support, so that the target can be set up in the future for arrest, institutionalization, or forced suicide. Other goals of this harassment is to destroy the targets reputation and credibility. Make the target look crazy or unstable.</p>
<p>Other goals involve sensitizing the target to everyday stimuli’s as a form of control, which is used to control targets when they get out of line. Once the target is sensitized, the Citizen Informants have an easier time identifying the Targeted Individual in public. The targets sensitivity is most likely added to their file as a warning marker and sign to watch for future reactions to.</p>
<p>The structure of this type of notification makes the targets vulnerable. Once a community goes into monitoring mode, they unofficially work towards driving the target from the community. This can be done by making the target destitute. Secondary goals include making the target homeless, jobless, giving them a breakdown, and the primary goals seems to be to drive the target to forced suicide. This is the same thing that was done to targets of the Stasi and Cointelpro investigations. It&#8217;s a useful way of eliminating perceived enemies of the state.</p>
<p>What are other Names for Gang Stalking?</p>
<p>There are many names for this form of systemic control and harassment. Under the Gang Stalking label you will also find such terms as Community Mobbing, Community Stalking, Stalking by Proxy, Organized Stalking, Cause Stalking, Multi-Stalking, but it&#8217;s all part of the same community notification harassment protocol. What many people do not realize is that Gang Stalking is just one appendage of this systemic form of control. There are other forms of control used to repress, and keep individuals in line. Other forms or appendages include, but are not limited to: Mobbing, Cointelpro, The Buzzsaw, Covert War, Electronic Harassment, etc. These are the just some of the names being given to a very old game, that is once again being played by governments on their unsuspecting citizens.</p>
<p>How are targets chosen?</p>
<p>Officially targets can be flagged and investigated for suspected, or reported behaviours. Unofficially the Targets can be chosen because of many other reasons. They can be chosen for political views. They can be chosen for whistle-blowing. They can be chosen because they belong to a dissident movement. They can be chosen because they asserted their rights at work, or filed a complaint. They can be chosen because they made the wrong enemy. Were considered to be too outspoken, unwittingly investigated something that the state did not want investigated, signed a petition, wrote a letter. They were deemed as suspicious by a civilian spy/snitch and their names were handed over.</p>
<p>It’s becoming apparent that targets might be chosen for this systemic form of control, if they are not already in some way a part of this controlled system. Eg. Many Targeted Individuals seem to be unaware of this community notification, flagging and monitoring system. Some targets also seem to be unaware that large chunks of our society are now being used as Citizen Informants.</p>
<p>Who gets targeted?</p>
<p>Targeting can happen to anyone in society. In the past primary targets of programs such as Cointelpro have been minorities. Targeting however can happen to anyone. Individuals are often targeted for being outspoken, whistle blowers, dissidents, people who go up against wealthy corporations, woman’s groups, (single) women, minorities, extremists, conspiracy theorists, anti-war proponents, individuals identified or targeted as problems at these community meetings, and other innocent individuals. The majority of the targets are often not aware that they are being targeted in this way. When a target moves, changes jobs, the harassment still continues, because they are still flagged, and a notification is still going out to everyone they come in contact with. Every time the target moves, the same information, lies, and slander will be spread out into the new community and the systemic monitoring and harassment will continue. <a href="https://gangstalking.wordpress.com/Forum/YaBB.pl?num=1205738832/0" target="newwin"><span style="color:#000000;">Traits of those targeted</span></a></p>

<p>Who takes part?</p>
<p>People from all walks of life are a part of this system, because once a target is flagged, their information is distributed to a wide range of people, organizations, and communities. People from all races, ages, genders. Every sector of society that you can think of is a part of this. Civilian Spies/Snitches include, but are not limited to: General laborers, the wealthy, bikers, drug dealers, drug users, street people, punks, hip hop culture, KKK, black activists, church groups, youth groups, Fire Fighters, police officers, lawyers, health care workers, store keepers, maids, janitors, cable installers, phone repair persons, mail carriers, locksmiths, electricians, etc. There really is no minimum or maximum age range. An article came out recently in the UK, saying they were recruiting children as young as eight years old to be <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2689996/Children-aged-eight-enlisted-as-c%20ouncil-snoopers.html" target="newwin"> <span style="color:#000000;"> Covert Human Intelligence Sources. </span></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2689996/Children-aged-eight-enlisted-as-c%20ouncil-snoopers.html" target="_blank">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2689996/Children-aged-eight-enlisted-as-c%20ouncil-snoopers.html</a></p>
<p>Public individuals that the Targeted Individual comes in contact with are given this warning. These community notifications started with good intentions. Workers and the community at large do have a right to be notified if they are going to encounter persons who have violent, inappropriate histories. Citizens want to be able to protect themselves and their communities, however what is happening is that this program is also being used to falsely target innocent people.</p>
<p>Many do not understand or care that the end consequence of this flagging, this harassment protocol is to destroy a person. Many people in today&#8217;s society are scared, they are willing to give up personal freedoms, for a false sense of security, and if that means taking away the rights of another individual to accomplish this, they have no problem doing this.</p>
<p>Why people participate in Gang Stalking?</p>
<p>There are many reasons that someone takes part in this.</p>
<p>1. Some do it for the sense of power that it gives them. They feel in control. Many wholeheartedly believe that this let&#8217;s them know who is bad and who they need to protect themselves and their communities from.</p>
<p>2. Others do this as a way to make friends and keep friends. It’s something social and fun for them to do. They love that special feeling of monitoring and protecting their community. Many in society use the one handed sign language to communicate and it&#8217;s very effective in breaking down race, gender, age, social barriers. Many believe that it also let&#8217;s them know who is on their side, vs who could be the potential target.</p>
<p>3. Others are forced or blackmailed by the State or the police into taking part. I have seen a few people pressured into taking part.</p>
<p>4. They are told that they are part of homeland or national security. They are told that they are being used to help keep and eye on dangerous or emotionally disturbed individuals. They see themselves as heroic spies for the state.</p>
<p>5. Others are just local thugs or Informants who are already being used for other activities, and their energies are just diverted over into these community health and safety programs. Eg. Some may be given the choice of monitoring a Targeted Individual for the community or the police vs going to jail.</p>
<p>6. Others are told outright lies and slander about the target to get them to go along with ruining the targets life. Eg. Many caring families are told that the individuals has displayed mental health issues, or other socially unacceptable behaviours and might be a danger to themselves or the community at large, and that the notification is necessary for keeping the community safe. They are asked not to disclose this.</p>
<p>7. Many are however just average citizens who in the course of going about their day to day jobs, are being used to keep an eye out, and if a flagged target does come into their vicinity, they are asked to watch, monitor and observe the target. It&#8217;s the way the society is.</p>
<p>What are some techniques used against targets?</p>
<p>A few of the most common techniques are listed below.</p>
<p>a) Classical conditioning.</p>
<p>Getting a Targeted Individual sensitized to an everyday stimuli. The targeted individual over a period of months, or even years is negatively sensitized to an everyday stimuli, which is then used to harass them. It’s used out in public to let them know they are constantly being harassed and monitored. Some examples of everyday stimulus that might be used include: sounds, colors, patterns, actions. Eg. Red, white, yellow, strips, pens clicking, key jangling, loud coughing, loud whistling, loud smacking of clapping of hands together, cell phones, laptops, etc.</p>
<p>b) 24/7 Surveillance This will involve flagging and following the target everywhere they go. Learning about the target. Where they shop, work, play, who their friends and family are. Getting close to the target, moving into the community or apartment where they live, across the street. Monitoring the targets phone, house, and computer activity. <a href="http://www.newport.gov.uk/stellent/groups/public/documents/policies_and_procedures/n_039963.pdf" target="newwin"> <span style="color:#000000;"> Surveillance Policy. </span></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.newport.gov.uk/stellent/groups/public/documents/policies_and_procedures/n_039963.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.newport.gov.uk/stellent/groups/public/documents/policies_and_procedures/n_039963.pdf</a></p>
<p>c) Isolation of said target.</p>
<p>This is done via reports. The flagging is meant to warn the community, but they act as little more than slander campaigns. They present a one sided assessment of the targets behavior and activity. The target is never allowed to tell their side of the story or to clear their name. This one sided assessment can include false reports, lies, and legitimate incidents where the target was set up. Eg. People in the targets community are told that the target is crazy, dangerous, a thief, into drugs, a prostitute, pedophile, in trouble for something, needs to be watched. This very flagging in and of itself is capable of creating paranoia, and false interpretation of everyday incidents.</p>
<p>Files will even be produced on the target.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been shown that community notifications of any kind can and do create a sense of paranoia within a community.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.johnhoward.ab.ca/pub/pdf/C20.pdf" target="newwin"> <span style="color:#000000;"> Community Notification </span></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.johnhoward.ab.ca/pub/pdf/C20.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.johnhoward.ab.ca/pub/pdf/C20.pdf</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Some people might argue that they would feel more secure if they were aware of the identities of dangerous offenders in their neighborhoods, but widespread community notification actually serves to heighten fear of victimization. In a large metropolitan area, hundreds of thousands of people are notified of a dangerous offender&#8217;s release, while only hundreds will come into contact with him in the community. This blanket notification propagates the belief that there are more &#8220;predators&#8221; in the community than ever before, and fearful attitudes among members of the public are reinforced. A vicious cycle results: widespread notification leads to an increase in the community&#8217;s fear of crime which, in turn, leads to more calls for notification. We would also argue that the use of inflammatory language such as &#8220;predator&#8221; by politicians and officials also works to heighten fear and increase calls for more punitive action.</p></blockquote>
<p>d) Noise and mimicking campaigns.</p>
<p>Disrupting the targets life, sleep with loud power tools, construction, stereos, doors slamming, etc. Talking in public about private things in the targets life. Mimicking actions of the target. Basically letting the target know that they are in the targets life. Daily interferences, nothing that would be too overt to the untrained eye, but psychologically degrading and damaging to the target over time.</p>
<p>e) Everyday life breaks and street theatre.</p>
<p>Flat tires, sleep deprivation, drugging food, putting dirt on targets property. Mass strangers doing things in public to annoy targets. These strangers might get text messaged to be at a specific time and place, and perform a specific action.</p>
<p>f) Electronic Harassment.</p>
<p>Electronic means can be used to create the illusion that the target is having a mental breakdown, when in fact they are being targeted and harassed by a community that is trying to get them to move, because they believe that the person is a danger, or an undesirable. This flagging system allows the community to treat the target as less than, someone they are allowed to harass, and victimize. It gives them a license to do unspeakable things to innocent targets, and their families.</p>

<p>These actions might seem harmless to these Citizen Informants, but in reality the actions could be causing great psychological trauma for the target. Eg. Blocking targets path, getting ahead of them in line, cutting or boxing them in on the road, saying or doing things to elicit a response from targets. Etc. It&#8217;s like the death of a thousand paper cuts. One or two minor incidents will not cause any harm to the target, but over time the target is <a title="But if something happens on an on-going basis and goes on and on and on, eventually it reaches the stage of being absolutely intolerable," href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/4612951/Man-jailed-for-whistling-Addams-Family-theme-tune-at-neighbours.html" target="newwin"><span style="color:#bb0000;">slowly worn down.</span></a></p>

<p>Where does the support or funding for this come from?</p>
<p>Though the systemic harassment that Targeted Individuals refer to as Gang Stalking is immoral and unethical in nature, programs such as this in democratic countries, and none democratic countries have always been funded by the Government. They are the only ones with enough money, coordination, and power to keep such a system in place. These Co-ordinated efforts then join hands with others for this systemic form of control and harassment.</p>

<blockquote><p>“You mean to tell me that it is legal for corporations from the private sector to team up with local law enforcement officials in efforts to spy on innocent members of our society? You also mean to tell me that the synthesis of law enforcement authority and the drive of for-profit companies operate under little to no guidelines or restrictions and it is unclear to whom they are responsible to?”</p></blockquote>
<p>What can you do to help?</p>
<p>1. If you know someone who is being targeted in this way please don’t go along with it. Don’t assume that the person is guilty or a bad person. Many innocent people are currently being targeted, and people are being told lies. This form of harassment is systemic and it&#8217;s about state control and conformity. The express goal of this harassment is to destroy the individual over time.</p>
<p>2. If you are aware of someone being harassed in this way, subtly direct them to websites that deal with Gang Stalking, or sites for Targeted Individuals. Knowledge is power.</p>
<p>3. You can subtly suggest that your local newspapers or  community papers print articles about Targeted Individuals  or even an write an objective piece about Gang Stalking.</p>
<p>4. If you are a law maker, you can petition for changing the laws. Ensure targets who are flagged in this way have proper notification letting them know that they are flagged. Convicted criminals have this right, why not targets? Many of whom are innocent members of the public.<br />
Petition for better oversight of these programs. As it  stands Communities are getting away with serious human  rights abuses, and complaints are not being heard. Authority  figures such as the police in many cases are not taking the  reports seriously due to the type of warning markers  attached to a targets file.</p>
<p>5. If you are a lawyer our community needs lawyers who are skilled in helping targets access Freedom Of Information files. Lawyers who can help targets get their files reviewed, or corrected. Lawyers who can work with the existing privacy laws to limit who and where the targets information is disseminated to. We need human rights lawyers who can address the complaints of abuses that are happening to people listed or flagged in this manner. Illegal surveillance, illegal access of mail and electronic communications, and torture via electronic monitoring.</p>
<p>6. Mental health professionals can recognize that there is illegal harassment happening to individuals who are flagged, listed or have warning markers placed against their names. Community notifications can and do create paranoia within communities. This notification makes targets prime for harassment, and community mobbing.<br />
They can objectively investigate the complaints, and become familiar with the Electronic means of monitoring and harassment that are being used. Laws are just starting to catch up to the technology. Eg. Europe is considering a ban on the mosquito device, because it infringes on the human rights of children.</p>
<p>7. You can subtly offer your support to someone who is being unfairly treated, in very small little ways.</p>
<p>8. You can bring up the subject of Gang Stalking or Targeted Individuals.</p>
<p>How do participants communicate?</p>
<p>Communication happens in a number of ways. When on the street or in cars patrolling, they use a  <a href="https://gangstalking.wordpress.com/2010/02/informant-signals/" target="newwin"><span style="color:#bb0000;">one handed sign language.</span></a> Citizen Informants also seem to get ques via cellphone and some via earphones.</p>

<p>Their one handed sign language include things like tapping the side of the nose, corner of the eye, brushing back the hair 3 times, the infamous double blink, etc.</p>

	<p>At this stage it&#8217;s assumed that the targets friends or family are contacted via mail or some other method, given the notification, and then they probably have some kind of confidentially agreement that they have to adhere to. Remember the news stories about the people given gag orders. One guy almost had a breakdown cause he could not tell his girlfriend about something and was forced to lie.</p>
<p>Now do these letters come with the one handed sign language? I don&#8217;t have that info at this stage, but at some point, just like snitches in East Germany they are taught the one handed sign language. Then they become part of this system. </p>
<p>They use this secret code the same way any cult does, or secret society does and for those on the outside they are harassed, or the informants choose not to work with those who are not a part of the system. I also suspect, but at this stage can not prove that this is probably what triggers much of the bullying in schools, and the mobbing in the workplace. Targeting those not taking part in this system. </p>
<p>After spending over 10 years mobbed, and Gang Stalked, I can truly say that this is the most evil thing that I have ever seen. </p>
<p>I also believe that this is the beginning of the end time structure. Right now what happens to targets is their lives are systemically destroyed. People don&#8217;t want to work with them etc. The end time structure is not just a mark of a person, it&#8217;s also a system were you can not buy, trade, sell without it. This system conditions people to comply, and to harass those who are not complying with this system. </p>
<p>Thousands of people are being eliminated from communities, usually the outspoken, and others, those not falling in line. Can you imagine how many innocent people are in jails, institutions, homeless, committed suicide, or killed people do to this? Will there ever be an apology? Will they review the files of those in mental wards who claimed that they were being followed around?</p>
<p>People want the elites to take responsibility for their actions, but what about taking responsibility for their actions? No it&#8217;s far easier to say that an authority figure made me do it and that&#8217;s it. </p>
<p>I can&#8217;t right the wrongs of the past, but I would ask that those in the know, do something, ask for a review of this system, because it is not right. What is happening is just so wrong, and how it&#8217;s being used is just evil.</p>

	<p>I was wondering if you know of any non profits that offer help support employment education training to conter the ill effects etc&#8230;. that being a TI causes for them for help if not would you be interested in starting one. Being a TI I have come to realize how important it is to provide for my family in the ineditable death I will experience in protecting the available resource to them in the event the end up like me and hindered from gainful employment. But I also would like to include monies to go to to help others that have been subjected to this any suggestions would be greatly appreciated I have found your site to be most insightful and helpful I wish more where spending the time and enrgy towards help and solution than the problems</p>

	<p>This is a GENUINE stalking and surveillance experience. </p>
<p>בס&#8221;ד</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to say something about my experience with gang stalking.<br />
i&#8217;ve been surveilled for 3 years now.<br />
initially, it was a covert situation, I had no idea any of this took place,<br />
the reason was simple &#8211; I was targeted and flagged as a pedophile.<br />
My condition was not simple at the time, I was bored and unemployed + I had a record at the mental health institute for anxiety and depression, I took prescription pills in order to reduce anxiety and stress, even though they are full of crap and I simply found out I had nothing but pressure and mood swings from being a little bit lonely and unoccupied.<br />
we moved residence to another street, my mom adviced me I would take a daily walk  in order to relieve stress at the park which was located next to a kindergarten, I took my guitar and went there.<br />
When I got there I wasn&#8217;t tailed yet, I was just an ordinary person trying to live his life and get out of the bum, I sat on a bench, and played my guitar for about 15 minutes, when a parent came up to pick her child, she stared at me &#8211; and then told her daughter &#8211; &#8220;look how nice he plays the guitar honey!&#8221; &#8211; she looked closer, and she thought I was eccentric, I admit, I was going through rough times.. the last thing I wanted is to get involved in a conversation with anyone, so I smiled at her, and went back to playing my guitar.<br />
and so I spent two months going there, when occasionaly parents would show up and start a conversation with me, such as: &#8220;Hello!&#8221; &#8211; &#8220;hello..&#8221; &#8211; &#8220;Nice guitar, what style do you play?&#8221; etc..<br />
&#8220;are you from around?&#8221; &#8211; &#8220;do you have a job?&#8221;<br />
showing a lot of interest in me and my behavior, sounds fishy, aint it?<br />
occasionaly the kindergartner would watch my step, luckily for them and unfortunately for me they had a security-guard located right outside of the facility, one day he started a conversation with me, and we became &#8220;friends&#8221; ( again, this wasn&#8217;t a choice, I felt lonely and I needed someone to talk to, if I had other friends, I would probably choose them, don&#8217;t you think? )<br />
anyhow, this guy kept trying to convince me into doing some indecent stuff, which by law is strictly prohibited, but then again, it was a strategy, an attempt to expose my transgression.<br />
during my trip to ukraine, I had a terrible experience with people there for no reason, *All people* with no exception.<br />
people started staring at me, it wasn&#8217;t casual as you may think, as if something was taking place without my awareness which has everything to do with me.<br />
I flew back to israel ( homeland ) and immediately became angry and stressed out, I took a walk to the park in order to tell my new &#8220;friend&#8221; what I went through, well, I forgot what he said..<br />
anyhow moving on.. that guy was a scum, one of the times I approached some woman with a baby stroller, you should have seen the facial expression he made, it was like he wanted to murder me,<br />
I approached him, and he was holding a plastic knuckle duster, I asked him &#8220;what&#8217;s that?&#8221;<br />
he said &#8220;that? oh that&#8217;s nothing..&#8221; and tossed it at the floor..<br />
( he made a fist , and his face showed a lot of anger towards me, he probably forgot he&#8217;s undercover for a few moments there )<br />
a few days later, some parent drove by to pick up her kid, she seemed familiar, maybe she was one of the teachers I had in elemntary school ( I&#8217;m 21 ) so I asked her if she was,<br />
I was amazed by the rudeness of her comment :<br />
&#8220;you probably looked me up at the phonebook&#8221; with a smile smeared on her face.<br />
this  was it, now I know why all this stuff happened to me..<br />
I became suspicious that day, became more aware of whats going on, I went back to my residence and observed outside the window, as soon as I approached the window, I was amazed to see the security guy hiding behind a tree, &#8220;patrolling&#8221; in the area, its wasnt usual, I called him up, observed him across the street and yelled at him from the window &#8220;you wont get away with this, I promise you, there&#8217;s nothing more wrong and injustified than doing what you did&#8221;<br />
conclusion: you can&#8217;t trust no one. </p>
<p>they made so much efforts in an attempt to expose me, even though there was nothing to expose,<br />
moving further, that same day an overt surveillance took place , surrounding me, juveniles riding the bicycle and staring at me, people driving by and making random stops as I walk by, a complete act of whats called &#8220;street theater&#8221; took place, pedestrians with bags in their hand &#8211; at first I thought this can&#8217;t be happening, and why did they have bags in their hands, I have no idea even now , but as the surveillance progressed, over the years, they have assimilated themselves with accordance to my environment, having pedestrians as informants, families, women\men, elders, children, teenagers, women with baby strollers walking and bumping into me, vehicles surrounding me, not in  a straight forward approach, but by patrolling around my vehicle, making stops, having commercial vehicles with black windshields just across my residence, using semi-trailers, placing garbage objects at the back of the vehicles trunk, using one rear-highbeam ( brake lights ) on while the other one is turned off ( that is almost constantly &#8211; when I asked  a couple of people owning these types of vehicle why is there only one tail-light on, they said  &#8220;it must be broken&#8221; from that point on, I knew that I cannot consider trusting anyone, not even my parents.    &#8211; could this be real? scary as it may be , but this is the truth.<br />
this act was on the news, as I turned on my tv by mistake and watched the news broadcast, as soon as I flipped to the news channel the broadcaster<br />
immediately changed subject and dropped a sarcastic remark about a situation which by &#8220;coincidence&#8221;  ( yet again another coincidence.. ) sounded like mine.<br />
it is me against the world, but I can&#8217;t fight this situation alone, god is by my side beezrat hashem. </p>
<p>any advice\information will be more than welcomed<br />

<p>But for real, most people would tell you this is crazy. Wouldn&#8217;t some of the people who are used to target other people aver find themselves target and snitch back on the whole deal? Like, how can you ever tell if people are just combing their heir because they want to and when they are combing their hair because of some espionage sign language type deal? Are drug dealers and users really the type to form part of a conspiracy to cut in line ahead of you in Burger King until you finally kill yourself over it?</p>
<p>This are the questions most &#8220;sane&#8221; people would ask, while combing their hair and opening a briefcase and not holding the elevator for you.</p>

<p>FAQ<br />
What is Gang Stalking?</p>
<p>A Simple Definition</p>
<p>Under Occupational Health and Safety laws, individuals are being flagged and placed on community notification lists. This is happening without the targets knowledge. In many countries these community notifications are being used by companies and others to target innocent individuals such as whistle-blowers, the outspoken, etc. In conjunction with these notifications, companies and others are in some cases using a practice that was used in the former soviet union called the psychiatric reprisal. This is used as a means of retaliation, blacklisting, silencing, or controlling members of society. Once on the notification system, warnings about the targets are sent out to every individual the target comes in contact with, thus poisoning their associations, and socially annexing the targeted individual.</p>
<p>Full Definition</p>
<p>Gang Stalking is a systemic form of control, which seeks to destroy every aspect of a Targeted Individuals life. Once a target is flagged a notification is sent out to the community at large, and the target is followed around 24/7 by the various communities that they are in.</p>
<p>The community notifications will go out to various places. Apartment rentals, future employers, stores and communities where the target visits, will be notified. Doctors offices, fire departments, police, etc. A covert investigation might also be opened, and electronic, means used by the civilian spies/snitches as part of the overt and covert monitoring and surveillance process.</p>
<p>Individuals can be flagged designating them as having a history of aggressive or inappropriate behavior. This notification system will follow the target if they move, change jobs, visit other areas. It let’s the community believe that the target is a person who needs to be watched or monitored.</p>
<p>Community health and safety</p>
<p><object data="http://www.wcb.pe.ca/photos/original/wcb_wpviolence.pdf" type="application/pdf" width="100%" height="800"><p><a href="http://www.wcb.pe.ca/photos/original/wcb_wpviolence.pdf">Click to access wcb_wpviolence.pdf</a></p></object></p>
<p>“In the service sector this may require identifying to employees persons who have a history of aggressive or inappropriate behavior in the store, bar, mall or taxi.</p>
<p>The identity of the person and the nature of the risk must be given to staff likely to come into contact with that person. While workers have the right to know the risks, it is important to remember that this information cannot be indiscriminately distributed.</p>
<p>A woman named Jane Clift in the U.K. went through a very similar type of flagging system. A warning marker was placed against her name designating her as potentially violent.</p>
<p>Violent Persons Registry</p>
<p><a href="http://gangstalkingworld.com/Media/2007/09/2009/10/defamation-and-anti-social-behaviour/" rel="nofollow ugc">http://gangstalkingworld.com/Media/2007/09/2009/10/defamation-and-anti-social-behaviour/</a></p>
<p>She sensed that, everywhere she went, there was “whispering, collaboration, people scurrying about”. “Everywhere I went – hospitals, GPs, libraries – anywhere at all, even if I phoned the fire service, as soon as my name went on to that system, it flagged up ‘violent person marker, only to be seen in twos, medium risk’.”</p>
<p><a href="http://gangstalkingworld.com/Media/2009/10/defamation-and-anti-social-behaviour/" rel="nofollow ugc">http://gangstalkingworld.com/Media/2009/10/defamation-and-anti-social-behaviour/</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.24dash.com/news/Local_Government/2009-06-24-Good-citizen-wins-12-000-damages-from-council-who-labelled-her-potentially-violent" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.24dash.com/news/Local_Government/2009-06-24-Good-citizen-wins-12-000-damages-from-council-who-labelled-her-potentially-violent</a></p>
<p>Jane Clift was targeted this way and spent four year clearing her name.</p>
<p>Individuals are being flagged without their knowledge. In many countries these community notifications might fall under community safety and health laws. It seems that employers, educational facilities, and community centers are in some cases flagging innocent individuals as a means of retaliation, silencing, or controlling members of society.</p>
<p>Retaliation</p>
<p><a href="http://www.harassment101.com/Article5.html" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.harassment101.com/Article5.html</a></p>
<p>Maria Buffa, a former salaried employee in the personnel department at Ford World Headquarters in Dearborn, Michigan, said she, too, was sent to a psychiatrist after she filed a sexual harassment complaint in February 1999 against a woman co-worker. “You think, maybe I am the problem, else why would they be sending me to a psychiatrist,” she said. The psychiatrist Ford selected, Dr. Edward Dorsey of Midwest Health Center, made a report that said the only psychiatric symptom Buffa displayed was anxiety. Dorsey’s report said that the referral came from Ford’s medical department and was at least in part due to her complaints of sexual harassment. He also noted that the Ford doctor who referred Buffa cited a couple of “incidents”: She was seen yelling at someone, and she had shown up at a fitness center “wearing less than the usual amount of clothing for that physical activity.”</p>
<p>In April 1999, Buffa’s boss fired her “for the good of the company,” she recalled being told.</p>
<p>Psychiatric Reprisal</p>
<p>The individual is then placed under overt and covert forms of surveillance. Everywhere the Targeted Individual goes, their name is flagged. In a big city this could mean that thousands upon thousands of people are getting a notification about the target. The person is followed around 24/7. Foot patrols and vehicle patrols are used to follow the Individual around, as part of the monitoring process. During these patrols a one handed sign language is used to assist the citizen informants with communicating to each other. They will use this to silently communicate to any business the target enters, or other areas.</p>
<p><a href="http://gangstalkingworld.com/Media/2010/02/informant-signals" rel="nofollow ugc">http://gangstalkingworld.com/Media/2010/02/informant-signals</a></p>
<p>Gang Stalking is experienced by the Targeted Individual as psychological attack, that is capable of immobilizing and destroying them over time. The covert methods used to harass, persecute, and falsely defame the targets often leave no evidence to incriminate the civilian spies.</p>
<p>It’s similar to workplace mobbing, but takes place outside in the community. It called Gang Stalking, because groups of organized community members stalk and monitor the targets 24/7.</p>
<p>Many Targeted Individuals are flagged, harassed and placed under surveillance in this way for months or even years before they realize that they are being targeted by an organized protocol of harassment.</p>
<p>What happens during this monitoring and surveillance is very similar to what happened to many innocent individuals in the former East Germany or Activists and Dissidents in Russia. Many innocent people in the former East Germany would be targeted by the state, and then their friends, family, and the community at large would be used to monitor, prosecute, and harass them. The same persecutions and harassment’s are now happening in democratic countries.</p>
<p>Once a person is flagged or has a warning marker placed on their file, the community becomes hypervigilant, and within this structure there is a targeted and illegal protocol of harassment that happens. Electronic means are used to monitor, harass and torture the target. When the target tries to describe what is happening to them, it sounds as if they have had a mental breakdown. The reality is electronic means are being used to make it appear as if the target has had a breakdown.</p>
<p>Electronic Harassment</p>

<p>This System is the “MOSQUITO” that is used in the UK to break up groups of unruly people. Creates A Protective Shield Of High Pressure Complex Ultrasonic Shock Waves.</p>
<p>The Mosquito device is being considered for banning by the European Union, cause it infringes on the human rights of children.</p>
<p>Produces a power field of ultrasonic shock wave energy. The frequency range is adjustable from 7kHz to 25kHz, with the PCC30 putting out 140db of sound (135db for the PPF40) measured at 30cm. Intended for mounting to vehicles for potential crowd control applications. Also excellent for keeping out pests from gardens, etc. Hearing protection recommended when in use.</p>
<p>Many of these devices are easy to access, and almost impossible for an unaware target to describe in a credible manner, without sounding as if they have had a mental breakdown.</p>
<p>Unauthorized intruders are exposed to a feeling of intense paranoia, discomfort, disorientation, nausea and other undesirable effects. Government research is currently investigating the weapons potential and may soon classify these devices!</p>

<p>In Russia similar means were used by the state to declare activist, dissidents or anyone they thought to be an enemy of the state as mentally unfit and many were institutionalized using this form of systemic control.</p>
<p>The closest thing to Gang Stalking that democratic countries have seen before this is McCarthyism, Cointelpro, and RED SQUAD programs. Red Squad programs were used for monitoring, and harassment of various groups. They have been in place for over a hundred years, and they also employed Informants.</p>
<p>Civilian Spies, who can also be termed “Covert Human Intelligence Sources” come from every level and sector of society. Remember anyone the Targeted Individual comes into contact with gets a warning about the target.</p>
<p>Just like with Cointelpro investigations, everyone in the targets life is contacted, advised as to why the individual has been flagged, advised not to discuss the notification and asked to be a part of the ongoing, never ending monitoring (systemic psychological harassment and manipulation of the target) process. This process is covertly designed to control the targets, keep them in line, or destroy the target over time, leaving them with no form of support.</p>
<p>These actions are specifically designed to mimic a psychological operation. This psychological harassment of the target is designed to destroy them over years, making them look crazy and leave them with no form of support. The individuals around the target carry out actions and tasks as they are instructed, without realizing that the structure is psychologically designed to break the target down.</p>
<p>Worldwide programs of control and conformity have been used with equal success and lethality. What we are seeing now is a co-ordinated and organized effort of control and conformity. Many countries around the world are currently using a model of policing called: Community Oriented Policing. It’s described as a systemic approach to policing. It focuses on instilling a sense of community within a geographically located neighborhood. Communities come together and discuss what values they would like to have in their community, community development, and it’s also a time to discuss any problems that might be happening in a specific area. If a problem is identified an investigation might be opened. These local programs in many countries have been forming partnerships with other government run programs at, provincial, state and federal levels. A process called Deconfliction allows them to share information. Reports of Gang Stalking are not only coming in from democratic countries, but they are coming in from many other countries as well.</p>

<p>The modern day systemic form of control could only be funded at governmental levels, just like it has in other societies where these similar types of harassment programs have been implemented. It’s all part of a system of control and conformity that has been in place for many years. A system of control with many local groups and appendages taking part. Many targets report that their information is passed and shared between country boarders, and that the surveillance continues even when they travel.</p>
<p>What are the goals of Gang Stalking?</p>
<p>The official goal is listed as a notification for the community, to alert them of individuals who have been flagged, or have had a warning marker placed on their file. It’s officially used as a means of investigating or monitoring individuals who have displayed inappropriate, or violent behaviours. The real goal in some cases however seems to be to isolate the target from all forms of support, so that the target can be set up in the future for arrest, institutionalization, or forced suicide. Other goals of this harassment is to destroy the targets reputation and credibility. Make the target look crazy or unstable.</p>
<p>Other goals involve sensitizing the target to everyday stimuli’s as a form of control, which is used to control targets when they get out of line. Once the target is sensitized, the Citizen Informants have an easier time identifying the Targeted Individual in public. The targets sensitivity is most likely added to their file as a warning marker and sign to watch for future reactions to.</p>
<p>The structure of this type of notification makes the targets vulnerable. Once a community goes into monitoring mode, they unofficially work towards driving the target from the community. This can be done by making the target destitute. Secondary goals include making the target homeless, jobless, giving them a breakdown, and the primary goals seems to be to drive the target to forced suicide. This is the same thing that was done to targets of the Stasi and Cointelpro investigations. It’s a useful way of eliminating perceived enemies of the state.</p>
<p>What are other Names for Gang Stalking?</p>
<p>There are many names for this form of systemic control and harassment. Under the Gang Stalking label you will also find such terms as Community Mobbing, Community Stalking, Stalking by Proxy, Organized Stalking, Cause Stalking, Multi-Stalking, but it’s all part of the same community notification harassment protocol. What many people do not realize is that Gang Stalking is just one appendage of this systemic form of control. There are other forms of control used to repress, and keep individuals in line. Other forms or appendages include, but are not limited to: Mobbing, Cointelpro, The Buzzsaw, Covert War, Electronic Harassment, etc. These are the just some of the names being given to a very old game, that is once again being played by governments on their unsuspecting citizens.</p>
<p>How are targets chosen?</p>
<p>Officially targets can be flagged and investigated for suspected, or reported behaviours. Unofficially the Targets can be chosen because of many other reasons. They can be chosen for political views. They can be chosen for whistle-blowing. They can be chosen because they belong to a dissident movement. They can be chosen because they asserted their rights at work, or filed a complaint. They can be chosen because they made the wrong enemy. Were considered to be too outspoken, unwittingly investigated something that the state did not want investigated, signed a petition, wrote a letter. They were deemed as suspicious by a civilian spy/snitch and their names were handed over.</p>
<p>It’s becoming apparent that targets might be chosen for this systemic form of control, if they are not already in some way a part of this controlled system. Eg. Many Targeted Individuals seem to be unaware of this community notification, flagging and monitoring system. Some targets also seem to be unaware that large chunks of our society are now being used as Citizen Informants.</p>
<p>Who gets targeted?</p>
<p>Targeting can happen to anyone in society. In the past primary targets of programs such as Cointelpro have been minorities. Targeting however can happen to anyone. Individuals are often targeted for being outspoken, whistle blowers, dissidents, people who go up against wealthy corporations, woman’s groups, (single) women, minorities, extremists, conspiracy theorists, anti-war proponents, individuals identified or targeted as problems at these community meetings, and other innocent individuals. The majority of the targets are often not aware that they are being targeted in this way. When a target moves, changes jobs, the harassment still continues, because they are still flagged, and a notification is still going out to everyone they come in contact with. Every time the target moves, the same information, lies, and slander will be spread out into the new community and the systemic monitoring and harassment will continue. Traits of those targeted</p>
<p><a href="http://gangstalkingworld.com/Forum/YaBB.pl?num=1205738832/0" rel="nofollow ugc">http://gangstalkingworld.com/Forum/YaBB.pl?num=1205738832/0</a></p>
<p>Who takes part?</p>
<p>People from all walks of life are a part of this system, because once a target is flagged, their information is distributed to a wide range of people, organizations, and communities. People from all races, ages, genders. Every sector of society that you can think of is a part of this. Civilian Spies/Snitches include, but are not limited to: General laborers, the wealthy, bikers, drug dealers, drug users, street people, punks, hip hop culture, KKK, black activists, church groups, youth groups, Fire Fighters, police officers, lawyers, health care workers, store keepers, maids, janitors, cable installers, phone repair persons, mail carriers, locksmiths, electricians, etc. There really is no minimum or maximum age range. An article came out recently in the UK, saying they were recruiting children as young as eight years old to be Covert Human Intelligence Sources. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2689996/Children-aged-eight-enlisted-as-c%20ouncil-snoopers.html" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2689996/Children-aged-eight-enlisted-as-c%20ouncil-snoopers.html</a></p>
<p>Public individuals that the Targeted Individual comes in contact with are given this warning. These community notifications started with good intentions. Workers and the community at large do have a right to be notified if they are going to encounter persons who have violent, inappropriate histories. Citizens want to be able to protect themselves and their communities, however what is happening is that this program is also being used to falsely target innocent people.</p>
<p>Many do not understand or care that the end consequence of this flagging, this harassment protocol is to destroy a person. Many people in today’s society are scared, they are willing to give up personal freedoms, for a false sense of security, and if that means taking away the rights of another individual to accomplish this, they have no problem doing this.</p>
<p>Why people participate in Gang Stalking?</p>
<p>There are many reasons that someone takes part in this.</p>
<p>1. Some do it for the sense of power that it gives them. They feel in control. Many wholeheartedly believe that this let’s them know who is bad and who they need to protect themselves and their communities from.</p>
<p>2. Others do this as a way to make friends and keep friends. It’s something social and fun for them to do. They love that special feeling of monitoring and protecting their community. Many in society use the one handed sign language to communicate and it’s very effective in breaking down race, gender, age, social barriers. Many believe that it also let’s them know who is on their side, vs who could be the potential target.</p>
<p>3. Others are forced or blackmailed by the State or the police into taking part. I have seen a few people pressured into taking part.</p>
<p>4. They are told that they are part of homeland or national security. They are told that they are being used to help keep and eye on dangerous or emotionally disturbed individuals. They see themselves as heroic spies for the state.</p>
<p>5. Others are just local thugs or Informants who are already being used for other activities, and their energies are just diverted over into these community health and safety programs. Eg. Some may be given the choice of monitoring a Targeted Individual for the community or the police vs going to jail.</p>
<p>6. Others are told outright lies and slander about the target to get them to go along with ruining the targets life. Eg. Many caring families are told that the individuals has displayed mental health issues, or other socially unacceptable behaviours and might be a danger to themselves or the community at large, and that the notification is necessary for keeping the community safe. They are asked not to disclose this.</p>
<p>7. Many are however just average citizens who in the course of going about their day to day jobs, are being used to keep an eye out, and if a flagged target does come into their vicinity, they are asked to watch, monitor and observe the target. It’s the way the society is.</p>
<p>What are some techniques used against targets?</p>
<p>A few of the most common techniques are listed below.</p>
<p>a) Classical conditioning.</p>
<p>Getting a Targeted Individual sensitized to an everyday stimuli. The targeted individual over a period of months, or even years is negatively sensitized to an everyday stimuli, which is then used to harass them. It’s used out in public to let them know they are constantly being harassed and monitored. Some examples of everyday stimulus that might be used include: sounds, colors, patterns, actions. Eg. Red, white, yellow, strips, pens clicking, key jangling, loud coughing, loud whistling, loud smacking of clapping of hands together, cell phones, laptops, etc.</p>
<p>b) 24/7 Surveillance This will involve flagging and following the target everywhere they go. Learning about the target. Where they shop, work, play, who their friends and family are. Getting close to the target, moving into the community or apartment where they live, across the street. Monitoring the targets phone, house, and computer activity. Surveillance Policy. </p>
<p><object data="http://www.newport.gov.uk/stellent/groups/public/documents/policies_and_procedures/n_039963.pdf" type="application/pdf" width="100%" height="800"><p><a href="http://www.newport.gov.uk/stellent/groups/public/documents/policies_and_procedures/n_039963.pdf">Click to access n_039963.pdf</a></p></object></p>
<p>c) Isolation of said target.</p>
<p>This is done via reports. The flagging is meant to warn the community, but they act as little more than slander campaigns. They present a one sided assessment of the targets behavior and activity. The target is never allowed to tell their side of the story or to clear their name. This one sided assessment can include false reports, lies, and legitimate incidents where the target was set up. Eg. People in the targets community are told that the target is crazy, dangerous, a thief, into drugs, a prostitute, pedophile, in trouble for something, needs to be watched. This very flagging in and of itself is capable of creating paranoia, and false interpretation of everyday incidents.</p>
<p>Files will even be produced on the target.</p>
<p>It’s been shown that community notifications of any kind can and do create a sense of paranoia within a community.</p>
<p>Community Notification </p>
<p><object data="http://www.johnhoward.ab.ca/pub/pdf/C20.pdf" type="application/pdf" width="100%" height="800"><p><a href="http://www.johnhoward.ab.ca/pub/pdf/C20.pdf">Click to access C20.pdf</a></p></object></p>
<p>Some people might argue that they would feel more secure if they were aware of the identities of dangerous offenders in their neighborhoods, but widespread community notification actually serves to heighten fear of victimization. In a large metropolitan area, hundreds of thousands of people are notified of a dangerous offender’s release, while only hundreds will come into contact with him in the community. This blanket notification propagates the belief that there are more “predators” in the community than ever before, and fearful attitudes among members of the public are reinforced. A vicious cycle results: widespread notification leads to an increase in the community’s fear of crime which, in turn, leads to more calls for notification. We would also argue that the use of inflammatory language such as “predator” by politicians and officials also works to heighten fear and increase calls for more punitive action.</p>
<p>d) Noise and mimicking campaigns.</p>
<p>Disrupting the targets life, sleep with loud power tools, construction, stereos, doors slamming, etc. Talking in public about private things in the targets life. Mimicking actions of the target. Basically letting the target know that they are in the targets life. Daily interferences, nothing that would be too overt to the untrained eye, but psychologically degrading and damaging to the target over time.</p>
<p>e) Everyday life breaks and street theatre.</p>
<p>Flat tires, sleep deprivation, drugging food, putting dirt on targets property. Mass strangers doing things in public to annoy targets. These strangers might get text messaged to be at a specific time and place, and perform a specific action.</p>
<p>f) Electronic Harassment.</p>
<p>Electronic means can be used to create the illusion that the target is having a mental breakdown, when in fact they are being targeted and harassed by a community that is trying to get them to move, because they believe that the person is a danger, or an undesirable. This flagging system allows the community to treat the target as less than, someone they are allowed to harass, and victimize. It gives them a license to do unspeakable things to innocent targets, and their families.</p>
<p>Hightech Harassment </p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/High-Tech-Harassment-Scott-French/dp/0873646169" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.amazon.com/High-Tech-Harassment-Scott-French/dp/0873646169</a></p>
<p>This is not just another revenge book. This is the ultimate revenge book-high tech recipes for madness concocted by the author in collaboration with the experts. Scott French interviewed engineers, bank tellers, phone operators, computer technicians, radio and TV managers, and asked them point black, “How would you get even with somebody?” What he came up with is a collection of electronics, chemicals, and common sense designed to push anybody over the edge. Discover how to induce insanity with lasers, shockers, breakers, and blowers; clear beaches with “silent sound”; zap computer disks from a distance, bypas computer passwords, blast boomboxes and bother banks. In short learn to harass the forces of science and technology and excercise your God-given right to get even with anybody, anytime.</p>
<p>These actions might seem harmless to these Citizen Informants, but in reality the actions could be causing great psychological trauma for the target. Eg. Blocking targets path, getting ahead of them in line, cutting or boxing them in on the road, saying or doing things to elicit a response from targets. Etc. It’s like the death of a thousand paper cuts. One or two minor incidents will not cause any harm to the target, but over time the target is slowly worn down.</p>

<p>Where does the support or funding for this come from?</p>
<p>Though the systemic harassment that Targeted Individuals refer to as Gang Stalking is immoral and unethical in nature, programs such as this in democratic countries, and none democratic countries have always been funded by the Government. They are the only ones with enough money, coordination, and power to keep such a system in place. These Co-ordinated efforts then join hands with others for this systemic form of control and harassment.</p>
<p>Ruling the community</p>
<p><a href="http://www.albionmonitor.com/9711b/policing.html" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.albionmonitor.com/9711b/policing.html</a></p>
<p>“Ruling the community with an iron fist. “Savvy law enforcement types realized that under the community policing rubric, cops, community groups, local companies, private foundations, citizen informants and federal agencies could form alliances without causing public outcry.” Covert Action Quarterly, summer 1997.”</p>
<p>ACLU Blog</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gangstalkingworld.com/blog.aclu.org/2009/04/30/mass-con-fusion/#more-5320" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.gangstalkingworld.com/blog.aclu.org/2009/04/30/mass-con-fusion/#more-5320</a></p>
<p>“You mean to tell me that it is legal for corporations from the private sector to team up with local law enforcement officials in efforts to spy on innocent members of our society? You also mean to tell me that the synthesis of law enforcement authority and the drive of for-profit companies operate under little to no guidelines or restrictions and it is unclear to whom they are responsible to?”</p>
<p>What can you do to help?</p>
<p>1. If you know someone who is being targeted in this way please don’t go along with it. Don’t assume that the person is guilty or a bad person. Many innocent people are currently being targeted, and people are being told lies. This form of harassment is systemic and it’s about state control and conformity. The express goal of this harassment is to destroy the individual over time.</p>
<p>2. If you are aware of someone being harassed in this way, subtly direct them to websites that deal with Gang Stalking, or sites for Targeted Individuals. Knowledge is power.</p>
<p>3. You can subtly suggest that your local newspapers or community papers print articles about Targeted Individuals or even an write an objective piece about Gang Stalking.</p>
<p>4. If you are a law maker, you can petition for changing the laws. Ensure targets who are flagged in this way have proper notification letting them know that they are flagged. Convicted criminals have this right, why not targets? Many of whom are innocent members of the public.<br />
Petition for better oversight of these programs. As it stands Communities are getting away with serious human rights abuses, and complaints are not being heard. Authority figures such as the police in many cases are not taking the reports seriously due to the type of warning markers attached to a targets file.</p>
<p>5. If you are a lawyer our community needs lawyers who are skilled in helping targets access Freedom Of Information files. Lawyers who can help targets get their files reviewed, or corrected. Lawyers who can work with the existing privacy laws to limit who and where the targets information is disseminated to. We need human rights lawyers who can address the complaints of abuses that are happening to people listed or flagged in this manner. Illegal surveillance, illegal access of mail and electronic communications, and torture via electronic monitoring.</p>
<p>6. Mental health professionals can recognize that there is illegal harassment happening to individuals who are flagged, listed or have warning markers placed against their names. Community notifications can and do create paranoia within communities. This notification makes targets prime for harassment, and community mobbing.<br />
They can objectively investigate the complaints, and become familiar with the Electronic means of monitoring and harassment that are being used. Laws are just starting to catch up to the technology. Eg. Europe is considering a ban on the mosquito device, because it infringes on the human rights of children.</p>
<p>7. You can subtly offer your support to someone who is being unfairly treated, in very small little ways.</p>
<p>8. You can bring up the subject of Gang Stalking or Targeted Individuals.</p>
<p>How do participants communicate?</p>
<p>Communication happens in a number of ways. When on the street or in cars patrolling, they use a one handed sign language. Citizen Informants also seem to get ques via cellphone and some via earphones.</p>
<p><a href="http://gangstalkingworld.com/Media/2010/02/informant-signals/" rel="nofollow ugc">http://gangstalkingworld.com/Media/2010/02/informant-signals/</a></p>
<p>Their one handed sign language include things like tapping the side of the nose, corner of the eye, brushing back the hair 3 times, the infamous double blink, etc.</p>
<p>Here is a list of signals that the former East German Secret Police the Stasi used. These signals below are not gang stalking signals, they were used in the former East Germany. <a href="http://www.nthposition.com/stasiland.php" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.nthposition.com/stasiland.php</a></p>
<p>SIGNALS FOR OBSERVATION</p>
<p>1. Watch out! Subject is coming – touch nose with hand or handkerchief</p>
<p>2. Subject is moving on, going further, or overtaking – stroke hair with hand, or raise hat briefly</p>
<p>3. Subject standing still – lay one hand against back, or on stomach</p>
<p>4. Observing Agent wishes to terminate observation because cover threatened – bend and retie shoelaces</p>
<p>5. Subject returning – both hands against back, or on stomach</p>
<p>6. Observing Agent wishes to speak with Team Leader or other Observing Agents – take out briefcase or equivalent and examine contents.</p>

	<p>I used to think I was TI, before I started to read about synchronicities, parapsychology, and other stuff which indicated the existence of extremely sophisticated mind control throughout history that the controlled persons would not even ordinarily notice.</p>
<p>I also think a lot of you people put a bit too much faith in your five senses. Hallucinations can be as convincing as it gets. A lot of your experiences could be explained by hallucinations, paranoia, and synchronicity. The rest could be explained by sophisticated mind control. I don&#8217;t believe anyone is really &#8220;involved&#8221;. I think people are being manipulated like puppets to give the illusion of involvement or human conspiracy. </p>
<p>Does that sound far-fetched to you? I can quarantee you it&#8217;s not as far fetched as thinking hundreds of ordinary people are consciously involved in a purposeless conspiracy against another ordinary person, including his parents and friends. And that there are thousands of such cases all over the world, and have been at least since the 19th century. That&#8217;s what would be far-fetched. Your own theory is so far-fetched that people will believe in God and other nonsense but they won&#8217;t believe what you believe. </p>
<p>That&#8217;s partly why your crusade is futile as long as you keep employing the tactics you do. No one will believe your story, because it&#8217;s unbelievable AND about things they are familiar with. If you want to make something unbelievable seem believable, you have to talk about things that are outside everyday reality. People know everyday reality. They know your everyday interpretation is nonsense because you are trying to talk about something they know from personal experience and that something is completely unambiguous to them. </p>
<p>People are being mind controlled and they haven&#8217;t got a clue what you are talking about because they&#8217;re all victims, you&#8217;re just the person who is supposed to notice something is a bit off about all this.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think the entity that does this controlling is super interested in what you believe so much as it may be toying with you or testing you, so you might want to try reading my blog post at my blog and acquiring a competing viewpoint. See which one makes more sense, your or mine. (My handle links to my blog.)</p>

	<p>I like your post it&#8217;s bright and intellegent, what&#8217;s so conspiracy ridden about an out of control informant system, corrupt cops, local monitoring units that have no standards what so ever, and threat assessment teams that do enable such monitoring? The research is there, you are bright enough to figure it out. Would you call the Jane Clift case a conspiracy, being followed, her details shared, and having to move, cause every place she went her details were coming up, medium risk, only to be seen in pairs?</p>

	<p>After reading your detailed and lengthy side of the issue, let me pose some comments. You do not need to respond. I already have the answers to these questions. These are for your benefit and others: Look around you, and I mean look REALLY hard, past the media hype, the government lies, and you will see the FACTS of what these criminals do, and what they are capable of. They follow the conspiracy of evil, and they don&#8217;t even hide it most of the time. It is never ridiculous to believe in God being the creator and our Savior, whom is love and truth. It is more ludicrous to believe we all came from monkeys and amoeba since they all exist apart from us as humans to begin with. That alone disproves evolution easily. My other comment is have you ever been inside or involved in a secret society or cult? You either have and side with them, which is where the misinformation can come in to posts like this you write, or you simply have no idea about any of it, and thus need to really see what is going on here. These people are much more than victims. They are human beings with lives and feelings who have been severely used, harassed and had their minds and lives practically altered and destroyed. And this is why the deprogramming techniques and tons of Christian faith and love are the only things that will ever truly free them I can tell you that as a matter of fact. Psychology has caused a lot of problems, which is why many kill themselves on those pharma drugs!!! So please do not come in here and act like you know what you are talking about, because believe me, you clearly do not. Your words were not only insensitive, but unwarranted and uneducated. And you have not been through half of what these people have, or you would not have written this post. The facts are these people have been victims of cult stalking and mind control harassment, some even murdered, so please be more careful what you say. In fact I think it is best you just do not post here anymore, because you will not be respected at all. We are here to help, not to make ignorant and insensitive judgments. There is PLENTY of evidence besides the people themselves supporting all of this does happen to them. I personally think the moderator should not allow these comments at all because they do not serve the purpose here, and they have no bearing on what is going on here with all of the people involved and the victims they hurt and harass.</p>

	<p>Dear site creator:</p>
<p>Hello, I am a targeted individual.  I am harassed everywhere I go.  I have lost all of my friends because of being gangstalked.  They labeled me as some sort of sexual predator.  Even my own family is in on it and believes the lies.  You don&#8217;t know how devastating that is.  Can you please contact me at the e-mail address provided.  I have no one to turn to&#8230;</p>

	<p>Steven, What you are saying is not uncommon, and I want you to know you are not alone. Sexual character assassination and defamation of character is what they do more than you realize. They take away your dignity and make it almost impossible to have any kind of normal life. Believe me, I know exactly what you are talking about.</p>

	<p>I would say interesting is not the world, for that makes it sound positive. The subject is far from positive. The more this gets exposed the more it will be harder to bring it all out. The people involved are well aware of those that want to bring expose to them, trust me on that.</p>

<h2>Gangstalking adventures. </h2>
<p>Hello world.</p>
<p>This blog is going to be about my adventures with gang stalking. I really didn&#8217;t choose this adventure, it choose me about six years or so ago. I didn&#8217;t ask for it, but I am living it, and so now I will share my adventures with you all.</p>
<p>I am not on facebook, or myspace. I get asked this question a lot. You can visit the following links to see some of the progress that is being made. I did create a twitter account.</p>
