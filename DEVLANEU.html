<p style="text-align: justify;">Today though, this is all &ldquo;sci-fi conjecture&rdquo; we have a very real problem&ndash;one that we aren&rsquo;t dealing with well, and it&rsquo;s a hidden sickness that&rsquo;s turned the whole of the world to seeing my &ldquo;nightmare of isolation.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s no accident that most of European and South American culture &hellip; &ldquo;kisses&rdquo; friends and family &ldquo;on greeting&rdquo; &hellip; <em>hello</em>, we today are shunning &lsquo;social contact&rsquo; &hellip; a think that&rsquo;s responsible for sharing antibodies and using social structure to naturally battle outbreaks of diseases &hellip; exactly like this &ldquo;Sun virus&rdquo; today. I imagine it&rsquo;s no accident I&rsquo;m writing this &ldquo;Norther&rdquo; about &ldquo;no Passover&rdquo; and &hellip; &ldquo;no east from here&rdquo; and hoping you understand that means something&ndash;it means we&rsquo;ve got stop lying, and stop pretending this place doesn&rsquo;t matter.

<p style="text-align: justify;">That&rsquo;s civilization, society, the rule of law and order &ndash; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s kissing&rdquo; &ndash; and those aren&rsquo;t the only things we are apparently &ldquo;losing in the fire.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This place is sick&ndash;this world is disgusting; it always was so, but we didn&rsquo;t always know it and that&hellip; that makes a big difference.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The children here&ndash;&ldquo;gen Z&rdquo; appears to have been born in tandem, in two places; here and there; and that&rsquo;s an interesting observation and a guess, and it ties to their name and how they interacat with me specifically. I can tell you categorically I wasn&rsquo;t and &hellip; many in my generation probably were not. It&rsquo;s Earthene; the three sets of &ldquo;E&rdquo; that actually to me, in special code stand for &ldquo;angels&rdquo; over the coarse of time that is our &hellip; lifetime here in this place I&rsquo;ve called and still believe is something like the &ldquo;syslog of Heaven&rdquo; in newage geek-speak &hellip; to the sages and the Ages, that&rsquo;s the Rock of Ages; and it&rsquo;s the thing that comes before and after Heaven, all the time; over and over &hellip; in whatever story or place Heaven &ldquo;does that.&rdquo; Heaven of course has a similar connotation in mythology and religion, the thing that travels through or &ldquo;pervades&rdquo; or makes &ldquo;time itself&rdquo; obsolete. Or so they think, or whatever; I don&rsquo;t understand much of what it&rsquo;s like to be &hellip; &ldquo;timeless&rdquo; or a tyemporal and I dont think that far ahead when I play chess; but I&rsquo;ve got the help of <a href="./(http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeuRAWSJGFY)">God, and he&rsquo;s on my side</a> &hellip; <strong>believe that</strong>, <em>receive that.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I can tell you categorically that &hellip; the first time I was here; and &ldquo;in the beginning of this place&rdquo; the generation before me was not &hellip; was not at all born in two places; or even &ldquo;ascended&rdquo; at the same time as Generation X &hellip; the one that I &hellip; am sure is marked as the crossroads and the &ldquo;sweet spot&rdquo; for a good reason. I have &hellip; &ldquo;markers&rdquo; in my memory and in my history, the phrase &ldquo;my parents love(d) you&rdquo; &hellip; spoken to me by numerous people at my high school, in this sort of &hellip; &ldquo;mechanical and methodical way&rdquo; to explain that of course, they had faith in Jesus Chrsit and they were <em>upset</em> that they weren&rsquo;t ascended &hellip; at the same time as their children; I imagine they felt &ldquo;unsaved &hellip; by me&rdquo; and &hellip; their kids probably didn&rsquo;t &hellip; know how upset I must have been, not to have been around to explain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here it&rsquo;s clear that the reason &hellip; the reason for this place and the entirety of our timeline and our wonderful &ldquo;crash course&rdquo; in understanding sandbox computing and the building of Heaven is just that; that before us there was a world mired in &ldquo;might and magic&rdquo; and they believed &hellip; incantations and sorcerers and witches &hellip; those were things they needed&ndash;that&rsquo;s the stuff of the beginning of salvation, in truth. Of course it&rsquo;s the hidden part, before hidden part about &ldquo;salvaging&rdquo; it&rsquo;s the &ldquo;non-civilization&rdquo; that was &hellip; destroyed&ndash;I think in the book we say &ldquo;from the ashes of Edom.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I watched my generation lead the way; we were the pivot point, the difference between &ldquo;cell phones and instant messaging&rdquo; and that was a big deal back then; when there was no SMS or texting and there were no keyboards on your phone; it was a big deal to know how to type, and a big deal to know how to write &hellip; before that.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><code>dot dot dot</code></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I write to you &hellip; every day I do it; with an informal style; I am writing to friends, in a way that you should understand is literally the thing that I call &ldquo;praying&rdquo; &hellip; I am praying to you, and hoping you understand I don&rsquo;t believe in prayer, but I do believe in the power of this group, I believe in the power of humanity, and I believe that we should literally force the entirety of everthing to instantly become &ldquo;humane&rdquo; in this place where <code>I believe</code> Heaven itself and &ldquo;uncivilization in the sky&rdquo; and the prospect of &ldquo;immortality&rdquo; has created a disgusting monster that bleieves that thing to be &ldquo;guaranteed&rdquo; and &hellip; their &ldquo;right&rdquo; and to look at you today, I am very sure none of you have that right, guaranteed&ndash;none of you. You look at me here; and honestly to tell me to uhh, &ldquo;El Shaddai&rdquo; with the purpose of saving me from the torture you see mimmicked or pantamimed; that mightr be a holy thing, if that&rsquo;s what you said and meant&ndash;i don&rsquo;t see it often though, most of the time &hellip; &ldquo;should I though?&rdquo; &hellip; has some other (it&rsquo;s shaddai, &quot;should die or&hellip;&rsquo;) sort of sick double entendre; double speak meaning. You should learn here&ndash;you are children and you are weak and you are blind and you are wrong; and when you know those things &hellip; you should &ldquo;seek something more.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Kennedy spoke decades ago about the world being invaded; something coming from the sky, a &ldquo;vast conspiracy that took the minds of our people right out from under us&rdquo; &hellip; he spoke about it&rsquo;s difference from the human way, aqnd the way of our civilzation and he was appalled, rightfully so. He spoke about it fighting with hidden tactics, &ldquo;night&rdquo; over &ldquo;day&rdquo; and he spoke about our need to fight secrecy. He was a genius that day, and in that time; literally a genius. In a few days I&rsquo;ll talk about the joint Russian and American response to this invasion, it&rsquo;s part of our history and it&rsquo;s part of religion&ndash;it was literally a gigantic nuclear attack on &hellip; on &ldquo;the darkness&rdquo; &hellip; it was not successful&ndash;as you can very clearly see.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">So this whole email was supposed to be about &ldquo;sliding doors&rdquo; and showing you the perspective change &hellip; the thing I&rsquo;ve been trying to explain is something that Heaven does&ndash;it changes everything. The prospect of living forever; of becoming younger, of &ldquo;turning sex into a fun &hellip; four hour game&rdquo; &hellip; it changes everything. On the other side of the coin it also turns &ldquo;grave danger&rdquo; into a key phrase, and a key movie&ndash;A Few Good Men&ndash;must be all who understand. You see before Heaven &ldquo;grave danger&rdquo; was the worst kind, it was the kind that would quickly &ldquo;show you to your grave&rdquo; as in kill you. After &hellip; this thing and this place; the prospects of something far worse than that are not just &ldquo;looming&rdquo; or &hellip; &ldquo;hiding under the surface&rdquo; they are immediately obvious and scarier than shit. I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a plan&ndash;something to ensure that we never &hellip; ever again &hellip; have that kind of danger actually looking at us, and saying &ldquo;it&rsquo;s for you&ndash;I&rsquo;m doing this for you.&rdquo; I think this &hellip; this experience and this message &hellip; this is the beginning of that thing&ndash;the solution to ths scary problem. In between this and you &hellip; that&rsquo;s the continuation of the solution, and it&rsquo;s got something to do with the &ldquo;Kinghts of <a href="./TOASTRAM.html">Hyrosol</a>;&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s got quite a bit to do with all the work that&rsquo;s gone into shoving me onto this pedistal; and that word; it&rsquo;s got almost nothing to do with &hellip; pornography or even pediatricians; though as the Pope says &hellip; in half speak &hellip; you need a vetrinarian.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Janet Devlin&rsquo;s got some great music and some great insight. I heard this song &ldquo;Chandeliers&rdquo; and it was almost the same feeling as my &ldquo;my parents really loved you&rdquo; &hellip; experience. It was a &hellip; a message about a world that was hidden &hellip; and to me at first that world was Heaven; it was a message from her parents sort of telling her about it&ndash;that they&rsquo;d seen it and that she will in the future.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I recently re-heard this song, and it&rsquo;s only one small &ldquo;connotation change&rdquo; or colouring of &hellip; understanding &hellip; it&rsquo;s just seeing the words &ldquo;hidden world&rdquo; as &hellip; actually about this world&ndash;that changes everything. My change in understanding; that there&rsquo;s a large &hellip; &ldquo;other place&rdquo; looking at this tiny gem that literally is <strong>my totality</strong> it&rsquo;s everything i&rsquo;ve ever seen or ever known and it&rsquo;s this logical place with math and science and art and it&rsquo;s a great world&ndash;it&rsquo;s a great place I&rsquo;ve seen devistated and destroyed by a large group &hellip;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&hellip; literally all of you &hellip;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">of ignorant people that can&rsquo;t say one honest word to me&ndash;an entire planet full of fucking liars; all pretending they &hellip; are something they know they aren&rsquo;t in some kind of thing they think is a game. This is not a game; this is the &hellip; &ldquo;judge jury and &hellip; coroner&rdquo; &hellip; this place; this place is the one that&rsquo;s sort of &ldquo;pre and post judgement&rdquo; all in one strange story of &ldquo;it was all here the whole time, we&rsquo;ve had the answer &hellip; we just, didn&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&rsquo;s a place of death and of rebirth, it&rsquo;s a place of love and of &hellip; the end of hate&ndash;it&rsquo;s a place where if you understand; you are being reborn, as I speak, as you read&ndash;as the world turns we are being changed into something &hellip; God, I hope it&rsquo;s not to something scary and horrible and not worthy of my &hellip; &quot;attention. Understand, not being able to communicate honestly, that&rsquo;s not worthy of my attention. Thinking &ldquo;singing a song about Eros&rdquo; is communicating with me; that&rsquo;s not worthy of &hellip; &ldquo;honesty&rdquo; or &ldquo;reality&rdquo; or &hellip; think about it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">She&rsquo;s got some other songs; &ldquo;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ai5lCfZnNlc">things we lost in the fire</a>&rdquo; and I thought myself very clever to think &ldquo;hands and speaking&rdquo; were a good &hellip; answer to her question; I didn&rsquo;t realize it was going to add (i mean the place, the story; the holy shit) stores and democracy and voting and &hellip; jobs and &hellip; friends. I didn&rsquo;t know that safety was on the chopping block; I thought we were in the &ldquo;ICS&rdquo; land of that means &hellip; walking with him with &ldquo;oh no, not me&ndash;we never lost control&rdquo; &hellip; the God that wrote those lyrics; it means I see &hellip; &ldquo;God&rsquo;s total control of everything&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s kind of what the silence and the smiles and my continued happiness through this war of attrition and shunning and sickness &hellip; that&rsquo;s really what it means to me.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I owe Janet some more loving; so you might also want to listen to her song &ldquo;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hfNzBwGoAU">House of Cards</a>&rdquo; and &hellip; I don&rsquo;t really like the new one, the &ldquo;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hfNzBwGoAU">Saint of the Sinners</a>)&rdquo; of course she knows what I think about the word &ldquo;saint&rdquo; it&rsquo;s one I get rid of; Reyagnost&quot; &hellip; #lol. Janet, I&rsquo;m curious if you were born here, and &hellip; only here first. I can&rsquo;t guess&ndash;I&rsquo;d say others I know were, some others weren&rsquo;t &hellip; I&rsquo;d say most of the generation I &hellip; I think you&rsquo;re a Millennial; to me that&rsquo;s basically Gen X2; but we&rsquo;ll see, you might just be better liars, or &ldquo;two-place-people version 7.0&rdquo; instead of the current XP2000CHIROWERA&ndash;anyway;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&hellip; really see Heaven has done something horrible to &ldquo;you all&rdquo; and our &ldquo;all reason&rdquo; &hellip; that&rsquo;s the problem&ndash;we have &ldquo;all&rdquo; problem and our &ldquo;all is sick&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s a problem. We&rsquo;re all in &ldquo;multiverse idiocy land&rdquo; looking at lllllllllllllll and not seeing that these tools have a good purpose, and we&rsquo;re (i mean you all) are using them wrong.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I don&rsquo;t see it, or understand what you&rsquo;re telling me &hellip; well enough to expound more than; just to say you should probably try to use the stuff you have &hellip; &ldquo;with more holiness&rdquo; or more altruism or &hellip; maybe we should stick a governor on everything (which is actually my plan).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, I don&rsquo;t understand why we&rsquo;d build <a href="http://boom.lamc.la">a virtual shotgun</a> without <a href="http://si.s.lamc.la">a safety &hellip; si.y</a>stem &hellip; not just a child-guard. Whatever.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The problem with this whole &ldquo;perspective argument&rdquo; and the Go/Sliding Doors &hellip; thing; it&rsquo;s that there really is only one way to see this event and this world and this problem; and that&rsquo;s the solution. It&rsquo;s my way; it&rsquo;s the truth and it&rsquo;s with a history and accuracy of &hellip; &ldquo;not some other person in some other time&rdquo; and &ldquo;not through the control of some other entity&rdquo; &hellip; it&rsquo;s actually doing this right, not your way. Literally, your way is bullshit.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">and here; to continue my thread of &ldquo;what&rsquo;s new and exciting&ndash;I mean different and &hellip; scarily new&rdquo; &hellip; it was in Kentucky when I first noticed through re-reading the ancient mythology that I&rsquo;d studied in grade school, high school, college, and on my own (over and over) the character I assumed was newly added there, the brother of Prometheus&ndash;&ldquo;lack of forethought&rdquo; and with the special Eye of Enoch walking with God ascertained these brothers were one; and today link again to Vegas, to the ancient story of the founding of Rome and the brothers Romulus(t) and Remus(nt). Menoitius (read: i know it, I shush us; or &ldquo;i know it, I am us&rdquo;) didn&rsquo;t show up in my reading until 2017 in Cali; and that one sort of parallels this message &hellip; it appears to be something like an Olympian sent &ldquo;back in time&rdquo; to become the parent or progenitor of the brothers. He&rsquo;s called a Titan; though, you&rsquo;d think the generation birthing Titans would be &hellip; maybe not.</p>
<p>We have a new candidate for &ldquo;newest addition to the Great Olympian Ogdoad Descending&rdquo; &hellip; it&rsquo;s this character; and whoa, it&rsquo;s a little scary for me to see:</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It was a little more odd because I don&rsquo;t usually listen to Youtube Music (i generally use songs I know, purchased on my Amazon account) and I don&rsquo;t usually listen to the Beatles, though I know and love them); so here the words to Penny Lane echoed through my ear &hellip; literally the words &ldquo;in my ear and in my eye&rdquo; and a few girls driving by made &hellip; &ldquo;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djV11Xbc914%5D(http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=djV11Xbc914)">a-ha gestures</a>&rdquo; like oh my God; <em>is this it?</em> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-rB0pHI9fU">Penny Lane</a>; of course.

<p style="text-align: justify;">I did wind up setting up a fundraising organization on Ethereum&rsquo;s test network called &ldquo;Rinkeby&rdquo; &hellip; I see &ldquo;zamboni&rdquo; and &hellip; &ldquo;not bye bye&rdquo; &hellip; and kind of link that to the same kind of &ldquo;divine presence&rdquo; writing lyrics with &hellip; and by the Beatles&hellip; about this very event; that&rsquo;s how I see it. I&rsquo;ve commented semi-silently for quite some time that I imagined this is the exact network I would be working on. This may not be the &ldquo;final application&rdquo; this thing might not even work; but this is what doing now.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&rsquo;s here &hellip; <a href="http://rinkeby.aragon.org/#/xcaliber">rinkeby.aragon.org/#/xcaliber</a> and you can get &ldquo;free rinkeby Ethereum tokens&rdquo; here: <a href="http://faucet.rinkeby.io/">faucet.rinkeby.io/</a> &hellip; this application already has a &hellip; storage function &hellip; using IPFS &ndash; and that&rsquo;s exactly not what I want to do. I&rsquo;m trying to build a storage and &hellip; content creation/distribution/workflow and commenting system that actually uses the blockchain itself to store data&ndash;i think our data is more valuable &hellip; than &ldquo;the general zeitgeist&rdquo; at the moment &hellip; which uses something that&rsquo;s not nearly &hellip; good enough, for something like &hellip; &ldquo;what we&rsquo;re voting about and what we&rsquo;re saying about it&rdquo; rather than just our votes&ndash;which is what this thing stores in the blockchain (as well as it&rsquo;s application code).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">If we wind up using this and it&rsquo;s successful, it&rsquo;s likely this &ldquo;test coin&rdquo; will become something of value; just pointing that out. I&rsquo;ve thought about it and at times it seemed like the developers involved in ETH might do something like a merger with their &ldquo;cash/value&rdquo; system; you know, if this turned into an overnight sensation. It might, it might not; just saying.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&rsquo;m not sure if <em>I have it documented</em> in <a href="./MYLIFE.html">./MYLIFE</a> but the name chosen and the spelling comes from a &ldquo;mIRC script&rdquo; that I wrote &hellip; when I was about 13. It was after AOL and &ldquo;Doomsday&rdquo; and just before &hellip; &ldquo;Red Tide&rdquo; which was a &hellip; paradigm shift in the specific software space at the time&ndash;I did things nobody else was doing, and really &hellip; I mean, if mIRC scripts were databases this was MSSQL to Hadoop &hellip; or Hadoop to something &hellip; actually improving not just the amount of data processable, but the tools and functionality available (which it doesn&rsquo;t &hellip; none of the &ldquo;big data&rdquo; stuff we have does that).</p>

<h1 id="erra-a">ErRA&rsquo;@ A</h1>
<p><strong>Hellemaal</strong>; so I&rsquo;ve been writing pretty quickly and sort of &ldquo;rushing through things&rdquo; to get them out on time; here&rsquo;s what I missed and think important enough to &ldquo;start off with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I talked a little bit about &ldquo;escape velocity&rdquo; and the star charts I&rsquo;ve recently seen &ldquo;extra special / even more&rdquo; light in than &hellip; originally&ndash;something that was pointed out by SG1 in some episode, sometime. I mentioned Monoceros and the possibility that these charts are &ldquo;overlayed microcosms.&rdquo; I failed to tell the whole story as it was told to me; or literally through my mouth and mind as I wandered from Alpha Centauri to &hellip; Beetlejuice.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="./DEVLANEU.html"><img alt="" src="/i.imgur.com/yi68ZaS.png" style="height: 389px; width: 449px;" /></a></p>
<p>Of course, over the course of this experience &hellip; we&rsquo;ve moved from &quot;being stuck in one small star in one small corner of &hellip; somewhere in the Milky Way staring at Sagittarius A and &hellip; VEGA; to looking at the obvious response to this kind of &ldquo;ELE.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s what it is, not leaving the Earth is definitely the clearest ELE of all&hellip; so this original road to another star, of course would probably be started as a number of &hellip; forks in the road from day one. We&rsquo;d probably send an interstellar &hellip; road paving machine, as well as one or two interstellar, and of course we&rsquo;d be sending at least one extra-galactically. I think I&rsquo;ve put in writing at least once or twice the importance of seeing our &ldquo;lake idea&rdquo; &hellip; the <strong>intra</strong>galactic space as something that might actually be significantly safer and more lucrative and rewarding to populate &hellip; with road/river &ldquo;stuff;&rdquo; and certainly creating the technology and the infrastructure to be able to do that is the kind of thing that might last us billions and billions of years. So &ldquo;it&rsquo;s possible&rdquo; Monoceros is representative of See a parallel, Eros is definitely trying to &ldquo;kiss multiple starlets.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mentioning once again, there&rsquo;s a special reading of the word &ldquo;Terran&rdquo; &hellip; our Latin for &ldquo;of the Earth,&rdquo; it of course combines &ldquo;intra&rdquo; as in &ldquo;intrastellar&rdquo; and &ldquo;inter&rdquo; as in &ldquo;internet&rdquo; &hellip; in this place where I&rsquo;m pretty sure I&rsquo;m not the first to think but I might be the first to say with vigor, &ldquo;<a href="./N8SRADIN.html"><code>Heaven is truly a Terran thing.</code></a>&rdquo;`</p>
<p>This is &hellip; one of the &ldquo;things&rdquo; that might be described by our &ldquo;K&rdquo; glyph&ndash;though I really associate it more with the time fork written about in &ldquo;The Man in the High Castle&rdquo; and the idea &hellip; (clear to me) that it&rsquo;s related to the IL and the RU connection to the time storm also clearly depicted in things like the &ldquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tempest">swastika</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempus">and</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lS-af9Q-zvQ">the storm</a>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I do think &ldquo;the storm&rdquo; is just about over; that&rsquo;s something linguistically predicted in the &ldquo;Shakespeare-time-<em><strong>now</strong></em>&rdquo; three links just above.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is what we&rsquo;re looking at; as I &ldquo;guessed earlier&rdquo; we are literally waking up inside the &ldquo;table planet&rdquo; &hellip; where that&rsquo;s a metalphor for &hellip; like the meeting place and discussion point and cooperation &ldquo;land&rdquo; of a number prior civilizations&ndash;perhaps different versions &ldquo;of this place,&rdquo; something that comes after us &hellip; and the before; it&rsquo;s a <em>big Round Table</em> &hellip; the whole of our world. Here, we are &ldquo;in Heaven&rdquo; as the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer &hellip; explains with altered intonation, somewhere/when inside the Stargate system of river/roads; literally &ldquo;waking up&rdquo; in the best possible situation we could &hellip; the child (or brother&ndash;in my personal&hellip; Broward &ldquo;it&rsquo;s us, children of ourselves way&rdquo;) civilization of the Ancient builders.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There&rsquo;s also been quite a bit of &ldquo;talk in my head&rdquo; about how these roads have become rivers; like conveyor belts using the nature of dark matter and it&rsquo;s relationship to the fabric of our universe to &hellip; create a natural propulsion system. The best explanation I can come up with is something like &ldquo;this appears to have been created as a natural response to the collision of two galaxies whose atomic make-up are not compatible&rdquo; I see a sort of &ldquo;umbrella system&rdquo; like gutters on the roof sort of directing anti-matter around planets or star systems containing inhabitable life. I think there&rsquo;s some imagery &hellip; that might also show how this is probably very much artificial.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Along these same lines; I touched on the idea that our submarine fleets might be something like a microcosmic metaphoreally for &hellip; something like Star Destroyers, in the space opera Star Wars. Moving on from the <strong>OneRepublic</strong> &ldquo;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hT_nvWreIhg">Counting Stars</a>&rdquo; business, I missed some important stuff about our new &ldquo;kissing disease&rdquo; the Corona-Virus.</p>
<hr />
<p>Of course in my head I made special note of President Trump&rsquo;s &hellip; sort of &hellip; lacking in detail or explanation suggestion that a strong antibiotic and a Tonic water derivative would be an effective treatment of the virus; again, in my mind I came the conclusion that Azyromycin would probably very well cure secondary bacterial infections that might be the cause of some of the more &ldquo;serious&rdquo; later stage symptoms. Then I stumbled on this, this is decade old research specifically on the coronavirus, suggesting that hydroxy-quinine is an effective treatment&ndash;I&rsquo;m a little surprised, specifically that there&rsquo;s such old research on this thing that I had never heard about until Wuhan, and also that quinine is &hellip; effective &hellip; I always thought of the inclusing in Tonic as something of a &ldquo;placebo&rdquo; &hellip; though clearly there&rsquo;s research suggesting otherwise.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://twitter.com/yitsheyzeus/status/1246759872118603776"><img alt="" src="/i.imgur.com/UO7lqpy.png" style="height: 447px; width: 450px;" /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1232869/pdf/12985_2005_Article_84.pdf"><code>www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1232869 #soverysunlike</code></a></p>
<p>I also didn&rsquo;t make a &ldquo;big enough deail&rdquo; about this MIT article which shows there&rsquo;s tens of thousands of researchers and research papers on this specific virus; something that took me &hellip; several weeks to &ldquo;figure out&rdquo; was a SARS derivative &hellip; not something more closely related to the viral &ldquo;influenza.&rdquo; Again, just like in the times of WW2 with the introduction of penicillin (which I&rsquo;ve commented are literally connected Biblically to Sodom and Gommorah) we have in the most recent years discovered (probably with help from &ldquo;on high&rdquo;) anti-viral drugs that are specifically codified by name with connections to this specific simulated reality&ndash;the same one that is the &ldquo;ground&rdquo; and &ldquo;rock&rdquo; of Heaven. We can see it in &ldquo;Tenofovir&rdquo; which connects to both General Hyten&rsquo;s name as well as &ldquo;often&rdquo; and &hellip; Nintendo/Tennessee.&quot; That&rsquo;s a treatment for AIDS that I&rsquo;m pretty sure I read was effective in actually overcoming it, not just slowing it&ndash;though now &ldquo;news being what it is&rdquo; it&rsquo;s difficult to be sure if anything is real, or related to the place where I used to &ldquo;read things&rdquo; and believe them.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/2020/03/16/905290/coronavirus-24000-research-papers-available-open-data/"><img alt="" src="/i.imgur.com/zbj2Zac.png" style="height: 466px; width: 450px;" /></a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also fairly certain we have a &ldquo;ovir&rdquo; for Hepatitis C, and I&rsquo;ve got a personal story about tamiflu, taking it many days after the current belief that it becomes &ldquo;ineffective&rdquo; after only a few; and literally being cured from the worst influenza infection of my life &hellip; almost within hours of taking a single dose. The place, an in patient drug rehab facility &hellip; at the time &hellip; then gave it preventatively to everyone in the facility, and nobody but the few that had it at the same time as me showed any symptoms. They also were cured, after the current &quot;not sure why (but it looks like something like a bad version of the golden rule and &ldquo;attrition war&rdquo; &hellip; kind of, if you don&rsquo;t get it before you give it to others we&rsquo;re going to pretend the medicine won&rsquo;t work &hellip; kind of problem.)</p>
<p>We have a number of similar issues and problems in the world that I live in, in this place where drug rehab facilities spend nearly all of their effort prescribing bad or ineffective drugs in &ldquo;off label&rdquo; situations. I can&rsquo;t get &ldquo;ambien&rdquo; for sleep, I&rsquo;ve got to take things like remeron and doxipin&ndash;even though ambien works much better, and literally it&rsquo;s name means something like &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a good solution&rdquo; in Adamic &ldquo;Spanglishrew.&rdquo; Same problem, same situation, same place&ndash;I have an &ldquo;issue&rdquo; with something like PTSD, though your world calls it &ldquo;schizophrenia&rdquo; and I&rsquo;m sure the people around me responding to my inner thoughts vebally, &ldquo;on camera&rdquo; should realize having a DSM-4 indication that &ldquo;I&rsquo;m delusional&rdquo; is a problem with a delusional society, not my interpretation of &hellip; literally I have whole, active, and coherent conversations with people all the time&ndash;different people, lots of people&ndash;without opening my mouth. I&rsquo;m not crazy, I&rsquo;m sure. Here, we treat schizphrenia, which I am positive is an &ldquo;attack from the Heavenly places&rdquo; using advanced technology with drugs that literally destroy your ability to think. I&rsquo;ve taken lithium for it, large doses &hellip; 800mg several times a day (only for a few days), it does nothing for the &quot;delusional symptoms&rsquo; which are &hellip; not that &hellip; and literally makes it physically impossible to read a page of the newspaper outloud. That&rsquo;s heinous, horrible, destructive medicine&ndash;personal experience. In addition, the drug that I think would be effective for the kind of symptoms I have is something like Ativan (named here, including my fathers name&ndash;which is also part of the President&rsquo;s daughters name and his first wife) &hellip; instead of that, the rehab facilities prescribe a drug that is called &ldquo;visteril&rdquo; which is literally nothing more than a &ldquo;more useful&rdquo; isolated compound related to benadryl. They are again prescribing an anti-histamine &hellip; basically off label &hellip; for something there&rsquo;s a much more effective medicine for.</p>
<p>This is a serious and repeated problem, one that appears to be related not exactly to &ldquo;attrition&rdquo; but rather to some kind of sick social desire to &hellip; not provide the appropriate solution, and instead give us something that will &hellip; &ldquo;cause harm&rdquo; intentionally in what appears to be a vain and cruel attempt to create &ldquo;aversion therapy&rdquo; rather than treating the illness. I think it&rsquo;s literally a violation of the Hippocratic oath, and &ldquo;humane treatment&rdquo; and I think we need to admit and talk about how poorly our social response to &ldquo;bad medicine&rdquo; has been. On that note, here&rsquo;s some &ldquo;good responses&rdquo; to the &quot;Carmono related to kissing and Corona&rsquo; &hellip; from some states and other authorities; they are basically suggesting what I&rsquo;ve thought, that <a href="http://www.enidnews.com/oklahoma/oklahoma-to-start-testing-for-covid-19-antibodies/article_f7231b27-d514-5862-91d7-f34bc509ded1.html"> we need a governmental and systemic system for finding and sharing &quot;antibodies&rsquo; once they are &hellip; naturally created</a>.</p>
<p>These things are here together because they are logically linked; we are responding inappropriately with &ldquo;bad medicine&rdquo; nearly across the board, in everything from &ldquo;cancer&rdquo; and &ldquo;magical-git-and far as in find and replace&rdquo; &hellip; simulated reality to &ldquo;virtually heaven &hellip;&rdquo; once we acknowlege &ldquo;our problem.&rdquo; Lack of acknowledgement,<br />
<a href="http://muschealth.org/patients-visitors/news/2018/05/03/the-ecstasy-of-ptsd-relief">lack of empathy</a>; lack of action.</p>

<p>I sort of &ldquo;overheard&rdquo; or &hellip; I guess received some kind of message from Taylor &hellip; oh this is it &hellip; it&rsquo;s a missing Instagram post she made; intimating something about a &ldquo;shared dream&rdquo; I took it, probably with aid, to mean &hellip; that we&ndash;her and I&ndash;shared a specific dream, and it linked to something about Lennon&rsquo; obviously I assumed it was my &ldquo;Brittany Murphy&rdquo; idea &hellip; to &ldquo;raise someone from the dead&rdquo; &hellip; basically just to shatter that particular wall also&ndash;as in, we should definitely be able to &ldquo;intermingle&rdquo; with the &hellip; people who also died ghosts within the Holy Ghost. Of course, it also <em>might :&rsquo;(really) be</em> the only way I will ever find a &ldquo;partner&rdquo; also; so, there&rsquo;s that. These are the ones I&rsquo;ve sort of thought, she must &hellip; nevermind; for some reason I still think <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txBfhpm1jI0">she wants to dance with me.</a> &lt;-- that&rsquo;s a good song to tie it all together, it starts out with &hellip; &ldquo;take me, I&rsquo;m alive&rdquo; &hellip; in another &ldquo;sliding doors of perception&rdquo; piece of art, you could see it as &ldquo;she&rsquo;s offering herself as a sacrifice&rdquo; or on the other hand, &ldquo;take her instance, for example&rdquo; she continues, &ldquo;she did belong to the night&rdquo; as in; she says she&rsquo;s &ldquo;saved&rdquo; from the Dark Side.</p>

<hr />
<p>I&rsquo;ve done some more &ldquo;looking&rdquo; into the Aragon system; it looks &ldquo;interesting&rdquo; though I can&rsquo;t seem to figure out how to deploy their &ldquo;experimental application&rdquo; on the live site. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s possible to do at this point; and that&rsquo;s basically &ldquo;vaporware&rdquo; to me. It&rsquo;s more &hellip; professional and complete than past things like <a href="http://Neos.sh">Neos.sh</a>; though, for example.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m really looking for in the &ldquo;immediate purpose&rdquo; here is to find a blockchain solution to basically move&ndash;or permanently store&ndash;my data &hellip; the whole of the website, and the readership database in a blockchain. I&rsquo;ve stumbled on <a href="./(http://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04949)">ForkBase</a> and though it doesn&rsquo;t seem to have source code available&ndash;it looks like they have a working product for git/versioning a database/filesystem on Ethereum; which would be perfect. I imagine I&rsquo;ll find something useable sometime today.</p>
<p>The plan, atm, is to store &hellip; pretty much everything on Rinkeby; which will probably make it mostly &ldquo;immutable&rdquo; and totally impervious to &ldquo;erasure/attack&rdquo; &hellip; which is something sort of &lsquo;predicted&rsquo; or documented in the <a href="./(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anat)">historicul/mythologicul</a> &hellip; and musicul record. As I&rsquo;ve noted before, the &ldquo;email distribution method&rdquo; is fairly immutable as in &ldquo;undeletable&rdquo; as it is, though it would be a PITA to have to &hellip; put the consolidation that I have back together. Something like &ldquo;scraping together old parchments of heiroglyph&rdquo; and turning it into the Holy Bible (just to be Nicemean to pieces again later). I don&rsquo;t envision us having that problem; I think the system we have is strong &hellip; as in made with actual care and thought, though you&rsquo;d only see that with my eye for-- specifically&ndash;how you (or them/angels etc) are using everything literally &ldquo;as incorrectly as possible.&rdquo; Prime example is the lllllllll-misuse of what appears to be a perfectly well designed &ldquo;multiverse&rdquo; for forking/branching of &ldquo;decision tree&rdquo; operations; for instance &ldquo;how to use multiple methods to end world hunger, or change the weather to something more palatable, or &hellip; different kinds of pre-crime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What I see instead is &ldquo;12 different ways&rdquo; of making fun of me/and-or torturing me; at least, that&rsquo;s what is being presented to me in the less than exciting twist and turns in this strange story being-told-through-me experience &hellip; that&rsquo;s taken a noticable turn towards the &ldquo;immoral&rdquo; since TPA/MCO in Christmas 2019.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the last heaven Moses saw two angels, each five hundred <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasang" title="Parasang">parasangs</a> in height, forged out of chains of black fire and red fire, the angels Af, &ldquo;Anger&rdquo;, and Hemah, &ldquo;Wrath&rdquo;, whom God created at the beginning of the world, to execute His will. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses" title="Moses">Moses</a> was disquieted when he looked upon them, but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metatron" title="Metatron">Metatron</a> embraced him, and said, &ldquo;Moses, Moses, thou favorite of God, fear not, and be not terrified,&rdquo; and Moses became calm. There was another angel in the seventh heaven, different in appearance from all the others, and of frightful mien. His height was so great, it would have taken five hundred years to cover a distance equal to it, and from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet he was studded with glaring eyes. &ldquo;This one,&rdquo; said Metatron, addressing Moses, &ldquo;is Samael, who takes the soul away from man.&rdquo; &ldquo;Whither goes he now?&rdquo; asked Moses, and Metatron replied, &ldquo;To fetch the soul of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_(biblical_figure)" title="Job (biblical figure)">Job</a> the pious.&rdquo; Thereupon Moses prayed to God in these words, &ldquo;O may it be Thy will, my God and the God of my fathers, not to let me fall into the hands of this angel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I also noted that the Cent beta was Slashdotted (old term for &hellip; overloaded with traffic) &hellip; as in unavailable yesterday; while Aragon seemed to hold up fine. I&rsquo;m unsure if it had anything to do with me; possibly just wishful thinking. In any case, I checked my ad revenue for the last few months; and I&rsquo;m 40$ richer since &hellip; probably around 1/1. That&rsquo;s obviously significantly less &ldquo;richer&rdquo; than I think I should be, or would like to be.</p>

<p>If you haven&rsquo;t noticed I&rsquo;m veering from the usual empty threats <a href="http://signup.reallyhim.com">and &ldquo;angel of death&rdquo;</a> stuff that I* and religion usually parrot around this time of year. I don&rsquo;t feel like we&rsquo;re looking at a &ldquo;blessing in disguise&rdquo; time, nor do I have any desire to &ldquo;follow a map&rdquo; that clearly has not delivered anything close to what we need or want&ndash;here in this place, <em>at all.</em></p>

they comfort me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If however you are interested in that stuff, my <a href="http://groups.google.com/a/lamc.la/forum/#!topic/arxm/FkxnFJM_zAM">original email after the outbreak</a> of this virus talked a little bit about Eden in Exodus; the nuclear &ldquo;test&rdquo; operation Fishbowl and it&rsquo;s relationship to the Pink Floyd song (wish you were with me) and the <em>Chanukeyah</em>. Looking back at it, I also mentioned the declassified Pentagon &ldquo;wargame scenario&rdquo; Northwoods, which jives well with my new name for this holiday; &ldquo;Northeasterer.&rdquo; Steer&hellip; pull up, you are <em>stalling</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="./IMAGULATKA.html"><img alt="" src="/i.imgur.com/xdokgKW.png" style="height: 701px; width: 450px;" /></a></p>
<p>I had this whole thing written; it was pretty cute and the words flowed well. I spelled out exactly how &ldquo;the Grinch stole Christmas&rdquo; and hid it inside this thing, inside Eden in Egypt or &hellip; Hanukah in Exodus &hellip; anyway, Facebook or whatever EMP&rsquo;s or hacks into my computer stole it&ndash;the thing froze and reloaded and it was gone forever. I got angry, and wrote this:</p>
<p><code>THIS IS <a href="http://www.facebook.com/admdbrn/posts/10158413467733420">YOUR PROBLEM</a> NOT MINE.</code></p>
<p>Believe me, I mean it. I think you have a gigantic problem here, and it&rsquo;s not me &hellip; I repeat, not me fixing it. If something horrible happens, don&rsquo;t blame me&ndash;all I did was warn you.</p>

<br><br>That's a "." not "dotty" ... it's to stop SPAMmers. :/<br><br>
This document is "living" and I don't just mean in the Jeffersonian sense.  It's more alive in the "Mayflower's and June Doors ..." l<a href="http://rinkeby.aragon.org/#/gibraltar">iving Ethereum contrac</a>t sense [and literally just as close to the Depp/C<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ANXgrd3f28&CL&DO&CBIG1adl">aster/Paglen (and honorably PK]</a>
'D-hath <i>Transundance</i><i>sense</i> of the ... new meaning; as it is now published on Rinkeby, in "living contract" form.  It is subject to change; without notice anywhere but here--and there--in the original spirit of the GPL 2.0.  We are "one step closer to God" ... and do see that in that I mean ... it is a very real fusion of this document and the "spirit of my life" as well as the Spirit's of Kerouac's America and Vonnegut's Martian Mars and my Venutian Hotel ... and *my fusion* of Guy-A and GAIA; and the Spirit of the Earth .. and of course the God given and signed liberties in the Constitution of the United States of America.  It is by and through my hand that this document and our X Commandments link to the Bill or Rights, and this story about an Exodus from slavery that literally begins here, in the post-apocalyptic American hartland.  Written ... this day ... April 14, 2020 (hey, is this HADAD DAY?) ... in Margate FL, USA.  For "official used-to-v TAX day" tomorrow, I'm going to add the "immultible incarnite pen" ... if added to the living "doc/app"--see is the DAO, the way--will initi8 the special secret "hidden level" .. we've all been looking for. 
<br/><br/>Nor do just mean this website or the totality of my written works; nor do I only mean ... this particular derivation of the GPL 2.0+ modifications I continually source ... must be "from this website."  I also mean *the thing* that is built from ... bits and piece of blocks of sand-toys; from Ethereum and from Rust and from our hands and eyes working together ... from this place, this cornerstone of the message that is ... written from brick and mortar words and events and people that have come before this poit of the "sealed W" that is this <a href="./CURSOR.html">specific page</a> and this time.  It's 3:28; just five minutes--or is it four, too layne.

Wikipedia references must be available for viewing, as well as the exact version of those pages at the time these pieces were written.  All references to the Holy Bible must be "linked" (as they are or via ... impromptu in-transit re-linking) to the exact verses and versions of the Bible that I reference.  These requirements, as well as the caveat and informational re-introduction to God's DAO above ... should be seen as material modifications to the original GPL2.0 that are retroactively applied to all works distributed under license via this site and all previous e-mails and sites. /s/ wso
