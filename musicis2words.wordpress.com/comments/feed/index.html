Sorry it took so long for me to get back to you. My computer broke and I wasn&#039;t able to fix it. I am on someone else&#039;s machine right now. 
I don&#039;t know how to tell for sure... you would somehow have to get them to admit to it, I think. Controlling behavior is the biggest clue, but it&#039;s hard to know if they are handlers or just a**holes, you know?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wow, you could extract those yourself.  Your future problem will be finding someone to take them of the surface of your brain...

A good example of where â€˜Agenda21â€² is leading society is in the interview of Magnus Olsson by Daniel Estulin. link here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9bd-B2dqCM
Magnus was covertly brain chipped by Swedish medical mafia seemingly for little reason other than expanding the database. I am an example of being brain-chipped for the reason of political dissent against the fascistic take-over of Canadian politics. The first covert implant was for thought monitoring purposes and for devising a plan to disable my dissenting voice. The second covert brain implantâ€™s purpose was even more high tech and seamlessly takes over conscious awareness with remote robotic remote control at the same time. Probably, more a solderâ€™s chip. If you are within the microwave tower communication matrix (God, I hope satellites never have the capacity to contact the brain-chip) and have consumed the reactive compound that allows nano energy weapon interaction upon human fleshâ€¦ there is no stopping the unethical, brainchip possession anyoneâ€™s body.
The brain and body has no way to firewall against cyber attacks other than nanochip software or some kind of built-in hardware within the chip, but the totalitarians would not design anything like this for slavesâ€¦â€¦.

					<description><![CDATA[Have you thought about that everything you are experiencing can be done to you remotely? I too am a victim or organized harassment, v2k, electronic weaponry, etc. I have done endless research and I know that these physical symptoms you are experiencing can all be done electronically and remotely. In the beginning of my harassment, I thought I could possible have some kind of implants but I later realized there was no real reason for them to mess around with kidnapping me or whatever it would take to physically implant something into my body (I have never had surgery aside from wisdom teeth pulled). The dripping feeling into your ear is definitely being done remotely, What are your thoughts on this? Wow, it&#039;s just so crazy to imagine there are so many of these criminals out there stalking and harassing victims like you and I! Really, I like to think of them as pathetic freaks who have no other outlet in life other then to harass and victimize people they don&#039;t know.]]></description>
