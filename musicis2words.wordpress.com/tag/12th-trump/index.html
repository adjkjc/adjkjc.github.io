		<h3 class="result"><a href="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/01/07/occulttechno/" rel="bookmark">Occult &amp; Technological Practices Used on&nbsp;TIs</a></h3>					<p>For those of you who see how there is a bigger, occult picture to the plight of <strong>targeted individuals (TI)</strong>, I ask you to read this with an open mind, and please bear with me, as I know I am repeating a few things I have stated in other posts. This post is about the occult and technological practices used on me and other targeted individuals. I will come out with another post soon, God willing, breaking down this stuff, in a list, in separate groups, under a new heading.</p>
<p>After doing some research, due to my own unfortunate situation of being an <strong>unwitting test subject</strong> with actual implants (that anyone can see &amp; feel), I have discovered that this nation has a history of doing <strong>unethical experiments</strong> on unwitting victims. If you were adopted, this may be the case for you.</p>
<p>From Wikipedia:</p>
<p>&#8220;Many of these tests were performed on children, the sick, and mentally disabled individuals, often under the guise of &#8220;medical treatment&#8221;. In many of the studies, a large portion of the subjects were poor, racial minorities, or prisoners.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_experimentation_in_the_United_States">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_experimentation_in_the_United_States</a></p>
<p>I am struck by the numbers of seemingly intelligent people who deny what has been happening to me, even after I show them the implants in my head. Given the placement of these implants (as shown below), I am saddened by my current situation of being a &#8220;<strong>scapegoat</strong>&#8220;.</p>

<p>After doing some research into adoption scandals, it becomes glaringly obvious that I have been used as an experiment for some very evil, disgusting people, &amp; that I was possibly <strong>stolen</strong> from my mother <strong>at birth</strong>, she being told that I was dead, especially when you consider the fact that I was held in custody of this agency for the first six weeks of my life before being placed into an adoptive family, even though my birthmother was supposedly matched up with my adoptive mother long before I was born.</p>
<p><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2011/10/spains-stolen-babies-an-ugly-past-on-a-staggering-scale-2/">http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2011/10/spains-stolen-babies-an-ugly-past-on-a-staggering-scale-2/</a></p>
<p>Although I have tried to contact the agency I was adopted through, I have not yet received a response. Is it that hard for someone to believe that I might have been stolen from my mother at birth, to be used for this hideous program of implantation with <strong>RFID</strong>s &amp; <strong>mind control</strong>?</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_international_adoption_scandals">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_international_adoption_scandals</a></p>
<p>Considering the fact that the system in place, which allows for these experiments to take place, is and always has been heavily involved in <strong>occult</strong> and evil practices, whereby they seem to like to &#8220;<strong>play God</strong>&#8220;, so to speak, how can I keep my mouth shut?</p>
<p>I am now the unfortunate recipient of voices through these implants, which tell me that I am a <strong>ritual sacrifice</strong>, that I was engineered to <a href="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpthoth.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="221" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2012/09/11/symbolism-mind-control-and-metaphysical-sabotage-in-relation-to-archetypal-transference-and-the-second-commandment-of-the-decalogue/12thtrumpthoth-7/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpthoth.jpg" data-orig-size="184,270" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="12thtrumpthoth" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpthoth.jpg?w=184" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpthoth.jpg?w=184" class="alignright size-full wp-image-221" alt="12th Trump from the Thoth Tarot Deck" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpthoth.jpg?w=540" srcset="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpthoth.jpg 184w, https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpthoth.jpg?w=102 102w" sizes="(max-width: 184px) 100vw, 184px"   /></a>born on <strong>12/12</strong> to be that sacrifice, and tell me exactly how my life was ruined through, not only  through the use of these blasted implants (I am trying not to cuss), not only through the use of mind control via tell-a-vision, movies, and mu-sic, but also through the rampant and uncontrolled use of <strong>symbolism</strong> in <strong>astrology</strong> &amp; <strong>tarot</strong>, which are<strong> archetypes</strong> that infect the <strong>collective consciousness</strong>, &amp; the individual&#8217;s <strong>subconscious</strong>, in the form of <strong>memes</strong>. In my case, as seen in the Crowley-Harris Thoth deck&#8217;s 12th trump, I was not only hanging upsidedown from an Egyptian heiroglyph meaning life, but a serpent is attached to my head. I have heard that <strong>Crowley</strong> was an MI6 agent, and a known satanist. Notice that the figure is also unconscious and has hardly any mouth. Could this have something to do with why so many people ignore me? By the way, many of you who know me, know that <strong>mu</strong>=&#8221;12th letter of the greek alphabet&#8221;, and <strong>sic</strong>=&#8221;as intentionally so written&#8221;. Wouldn&#8217;t a person in this metaphysical position have serious issues? It&#8217;s a miracle I didn&#8217;t end up worse than I am. The upsidedown triangle in the lower right of the card indicates that the victim is female. It seems I have been framed.</p>

<p>So, I cannot help but feel as if I am being punished for my actions in this life, which were directly affected by all of the things mentioned above, and therefore, I feel the need to defend myself.</p>
<p>I am now the target for all the things that TIs talk about regarding the torture I experience on a daily basis. I get the pinpricks, the itching, the burning, the constant pain, the gang-stalking, street-theater routine, and I have to watch as bits &amp; pieces of my own story get played out in the various forms of media (tell-a-vision, mu-sic, &amp; movies), as do many victims (I have heard one other TI call this the &#8220;Truman Show Effect&#8221;). This is apparently how victims are farmed for the creative inspiration that naturally results from living in a state of severe but unspeakable <strong>oppression</strong>. They&#8217;ve got this down to a science, folks.</p>
<p>Of course, when I try to put videos out about it, I get the <strong>online harassment</strong> from some very cruel and heartless people who cannot possibly think I am crazy when I only posted about my implants and the history of how RFIDs have been used as early as the 1950s, by people like <strong>Dr. Jose Delgado</strong>, which is a well known fact, &amp; quite easy to research. The fact that I posted a video about my RFIDs &amp; not 15 minutes later, was attacked by at least 20 commenters, lets me know that there are indeed, <strong>disinfo agents</strong> out there, just waiting for the chance to earn a few bucks by attacking a target who is speaking the truth. <strong>Discrediting the victim</strong> is a huge part of their wicked, perverted game.</p>
<p>Here is one other example of how a disinfo agent might work. My youtube user name is the same name I have on this site (<strong>musicis2words</strong>). On youtube, not long after I began to make videos, I saw a user with the moniker, &#8220;ignoramusky&#8221;, as in &#8220;ignore-a-mu-ski&#8221;. Is that a joke? Is he getting paid to do that? Must be quite a cushy job. Or how about the job of those who are tasked with the responsibility of surgically mutilating another individual? How are they able to live with themselves, anyway?</p>
<p>I am sadly reminded of the infamous <strong>Stanley Milgram</strong> experiment where people were willing to administer shocks to others, even to the point of causing heart pain, simply because they were told to.</p>

<p>In the end of it all, I am all too aware of how my <strong>freewill was stolen</strong> from me at birth, and on both physical (implants) and metaphysical (archetypes) levels. Since this is no longer deniable, as I am sure my stalkers are well aware, it becomes very difficult for me to live with the day-to-day degrading and humiliating messages coming from stalkers, both online, in person, and via synthetic telepathy through these implants.</p>
<p>The fact remains that, in my head, at each ear, is <strong>damning evidence</strong> against those who willingly put implants in my head to control my thoughts, emotions, and even my behavior; and in the tarot and astrology is damning evidence that there are indeed occultist elites, running the world, who set individuals like me up, to be made to do things against our will, which makes them directly responsible. I believe this is why I am being tortured. I think they want me dead before I can prove, on a larger scale, what was done to me.</p>
<p>All my life, I felt this absence of higher power, or God. When I was a little girl, I loved <strong>God</strong>, and wanted to serve Him. The bible says that God grantd human beings freewill, but I am saying that humans have taken away a large measure of freewill just through the &#8220;<strong>graven images</strong>&#8221; (images that have become <strong>engraven</strong> into the collective consciousness) of the tarot and astrology, among other things. The bible says that God loves the<strong> truth</strong>, but I have found it increasingly difficult to get anyone to see the truth about what was done to me. What in the world is going on here?</p>
<p>Could I be correct in my attributing the <strong>upsidedown</strong> nature of our world today to the fact that we are living in years surrounding 2012, and the <strong>12th trump</strong> of the tarot is an upsidedown figure in most decks (of which there are over 1,000)? Did those who invented the tarot make that card like that on purpose? Getting it in a reading is supposed to mean &#8220;<strong>redemption through sacrifice</strong>&#8220;, and although my life sure has seemed like one big sacrifice, I have yet to find redemption, in the biblical sense of the term. To me this card is a misuse of what is known as &#8220;<strong>the butterfly effect</strong>&#8220;, whereby a repetion of a vibration increases its amplification.</p>
<p>Okay, so I am ranting now, but everything that I have discovered over the past four and a half years have led me to this point. I so desperately want for the real God, the one who loves each and every one of His creations, to see the truth, and to stop letting me be blamed, and to stop letting me be used, abused, and killed in the process. It&#8217;s no wonder that someone in my position would feel this way. I am accused of all sorts of things that are patently false, as well as some things I am responsible for. However, if I was mind controlled my whole entire life, how can I be blamed? I mean, its not just the archetypal memes, the TV, music, or movies, but it is also <strong>mind control via implants</strong>, which is the most insidious form of mind control I can think of.</p>
<p>It was in 2008 that I discovered the implants, and ever since I have heard audible voices, but for how long was someone &#8220;whispering in my ears&#8221; before I became aware of these things? The idea that a person will not do something under hypnosis that they are not willing to do while conscious has been disproven, so it should be obvious that until I became aware of what was happening, I had been living under a state of <strong>post-hypnotic suggstion</strong>.</p>
<p>For many TIs, life seems like a world where you are the butt of a humungous joke that, until now, everyone has been aware of, but you&#8230; and the joke is, suprise, you&#8217;re being sacrificed! What if this was engineered the whole time that the TI has been living? Would the so-called &#8220;<strong>higher self</strong>&#8221; somehow know this, and have serious issues throughout life because of it?</p>
<p>If you are a TI, I ask you to see if you have the 12 in your <strong>numerology</strong>. It may explain much. Many TIs I have met either have the 12 in their numerology, or they are double digit birthdates.</p>
<p>Another commonality is that many female TIs have some form of the name &#8220;Anne&#8221;, either as a first or middle name. Imagine my suprise on a TI forum, when I saw the moderator&#8217;s email was &#8220;anna-advocate&#8221;, but her group name was &#8220;Jo-Jo-Jive&#8221;. I could just be reading into it, but after what I have been through, I am sensitized to this kind of thing. For example, having initials that spell &#8220;cat&#8221; is used to dehumanize me by my stalkers, but when I looked back on my life and remembered how a woman with the last name &#8220;skinner&#8221; was able to steal and use my ideas, being reminded of the phrase &#8220;skin the cat&#8221;, I am again made to feel like my life is a cruel joke.</p>
<p>It is really just <strong>covert slavery</strong>, which is worse than regular slavery, because the enslaver won&#8217;t even admit that it is happening.</p>
<p>May all TIs find relief from this <strong>heinous crime</strong>.</p>

<p>This piece is taken from a book I am writing about the use of symbolism in mind control. The Monarch Program is so named because of the observation that Monarch butterflies are able to pass down knowledge via genetic memory, and the fact that it can be applied to mind control victims. This means that <strong>those who have been mind controlled will</strong> <strong>pass down their programming to their children via genetics</strong>, which will then be reinforced programming delivered via television, movies, and music.</p>

It is the Egyptian symbol for life and fertility, which happens to closely resemble the commonly accepted symbol for female. <strong>What does it imply when this symbol is upside-down</strong>, as it is in the 12<sup>th</sup> trump of certain decks of the tarot, such as the Harris-Crowley Thoth deck and the Hermetics deck? Has anyone noticed how, in 2012, life seems to be upside-down?<strong> In a so-called free country, laws protecting our freedoms have been severely restricted</strong>. Has anyone noticed, when seeing news stories about how the Catholic Church, which is supposed to be a spiritual organization, has been indicted on child-trafficking charges? How spiritual is it to sell children into slavery to be ritual sacrifices for some occult desire? Is it also possible that the images of the tarot have had some impact on the state of our world, due to the fact that this image is in the collective psyche on a genetic level? I am reminded of the oft-quoted statement by Michael Ellner: &#8220;Just look at us. Everything is backwards; everything is upside down. Doctors destroy health, lawyers <a href="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/12thtrumpthoth3.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="101" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2012/06/28/born-into-slavery/12thtrumpthoth-6/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/12thtrumpthoth3.jpg" data-orig-size="184,270" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="12thtrumpthoth" data-image-description="&lt;p&gt;12th Trump from the Thoth Tarot deck&lt;/p&gt;

<p>If both chaos theory and quantum theory, as applied to metaphysics, dictate that what you focus on becomes attracted to you, as is discussed in movies like <span style="text-decoration:underline;">The Secret</span> and <span style="text-decoration:underline;">What the Bleep Do We Know?</span>, then is it possible to program someone into attracting negative things by using symbolism? Is it also possible that, with so many people studying the tarot, do readings for other people, developing their own decks, and so many people repeating the same patterns of symbolism in their versions of the tarot, that those archetypal energies become amplified? I submit that they have become <strong>glorified flash cards</strong>, causing certain negative memes (a term coined by Richard Dawkins) to become rampant in our world. From Wikipedia: “A meme is an idea, behavior or style that spreads from person to person within a culture. A meme acts as a unit for carrying cultural ideas, symbols or practices, which can be transmitted from one mind to another through writing, speech, gestures, rituals or other imitable phenomena. Supporters of the concept regard memes as cultural analogues to genes in that they self-replicate, mutate and respond to selective pressures.” The rising popularity of the tarot has allowed certain memes to pervade in our culture, possibly contributing to the negative situation in our world today, where so many of us now lack those freedoms we once took for granted. I should have known things were getting ugly when, on the back of someone’s running shoes, <strong>I <a href="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/splayedankh1a.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="139" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2012/08/31/the-ankh-in-the-tarot-and-metaphysical-mind-control/splayedankh1a/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/splayedankh1a.jpg" data-orig-size="448,448" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="SplayedAnkh1a" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/splayedankh1a.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/splayedankh1a.jpg?w=448" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-139" title="SplayedAnkh1a" alt="" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/splayedankh1a.jpg?w=150&#038;h=150" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/splayedankh1a.jpg?w=150&amp;h=150 150w, https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/splayedankh1a.jpg?w=300&amp;h=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a>saw the image of the ankh, being splayed apart</strong>. It was foretelling of what I would be going through in a very short period of time. Is someone tearing life apart in that logo? How many of these shoes are currently in circulation? To me, the image to the right looks like both the Ankh, and it’s meaning, has been violated. Regardless of where the image of the Ankh came from, it is the associated meaning that became the meme in our culture. Now what happens to those people who have seen the violated image to the right? Anyone who has studied chaos magic undoubtedly knows the answer to this question.</p>
<p>When I was a child, I felt closely identified to the non-debased form of the Ankh, but never knew why. I remember seeing it in a movie once, and I was simply attracted to it. I later learned the meaning associated with the Ankh, as determined by the understanding of its meaning in Egyptian hieroglyphics. I always felt there was something wrong with my life, with the way things always seemed to be lined up against me, but I never understood metaphysically, why it was happening. I used to think that God hated me, that is, until I saw the 12<sup>th</sup>trump of the Thoth deck of the tarot. While I hadn’t seen these cards until I was in my 40s, they seem to have had an effect on my entire life simply because my birthdate is 12/12. What’s more, this same peculiar deck also seems to have had an effect on my mother’s life, simply because her birthdate was 4/4, and her card was the Emperor card. Could this card be why she married an Aries and why her mom was an Aries (as seen in the rams behind the character in the card on</p>

<p>the left)? Could this card also have been influential in why the two people she loved the most were both born in the 8<sup>th</sup> month (as denoted by two 8-pointed stars on either side of the figure)? I would be the lamb at the Emperor’s feet, because I cared about certain causes (indicated by the flag), and would that be my best friend</p>
<p>who is represented by the fleur-dis-li because she was born on 6/6? Is it any coincidence that my mother was a trophy winning bowler?</p>
<p>I mean, it all sure seems like a set up to me. Now consider that 12<sup>th</sup> trump of the same deck, located on the previous page. Can anyone blame the poor sod born on 12/12 for anything, given the idea of self-fulfilling prophecy and memes? That person is pinned down, unconscious, and hanging from an upside-down symbol for life. I have heard some people believe that Crowley was an evil man, but the question remains: “Did F. Harris design the cards first, or did Crowley give her the design to paint from?” I believe that the bible’s original intent behind the commandment about “graven images” was meant to keep people from having such an influence on others in the manner that the tarot had its influence over me.</p>
<p>The way all of this is connected to Monarch programming is the following: the victim of a set-up, such as the 12th trump could have never truly had freewill because their whole life has been upside-down, making it impossible for them to “live life on life’s terms” so-to-speak, because life’s terms have been completely skewed for them, which makes this a DOUBLE-BIND. Double-bind programming is typical in monarch programming, and is how they put the victim in the proverbial “no-win situation”. From Dictionary.com: “Psychology- it is a situation in which a person is given conflicting cues, especially by a parent, such that to obey one cue is to disobey the other.” From <a href="http://www.laingsociety.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.laingsociety.org</a>: “A second variation of the double bind involves a situation in which a person is chastised for a correct perception of the outside world. In this situation the child will learn to distrust his own sensory awareness in favor of the parent&#8217;s assessment of the situation. One example would be the child who is raised in a violent household but is expected to see his parents as loving and peaceful. In later life this person will have a difficult time determining how to behave appropriately in a variety of situations. Indeed, this person will spend an inordinate amount of energy trying to decipher exactly how he &#8220;should&#8221; interpret the situation.”</p>

<p><strong>History is written by the winners, and the Muse is the exploited loser. If you espouse the truth, I beg you to read this story. If nothing else, please read the list below.</strong><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;"> </span></strong></p>
<p><strong>MU: “the 12th letter of the Greek alphabet”. </strong></p>
<p><strong>SIC: &#8220;as written&#8221;</strong> (From Wikipedia: The <a title="Adverb" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverb">adverb</a> <em>sic</em> – meaning &#8220;<strong>intentionally so written</strong>&#8220;, first appeared in English circa 1856);<strong> &#8220;unwell or ill&#8221;</strong>; or as in &#8220;sic the dog&#8221;. Consider that <strong>“MUSIC” can be read as &#8220;12 AS WRITTEN&#8221;</strong> or <strong>“12 ILL”</strong>.</p>
<p>Of course, one can also consider that word in the form, “<strong>MUSE SICK</strong>”.</p>
<p>“<em>Life imitates art far more than art imitates life</em>” – Oscar Wilde</p>
<p>I will add to the above statement that,<em> if you happen to be born on 12/12, it can be that your life imitates art far more than what you or anyone around you are willing to believe. </em></p>
<p>If you happen to be unfortunate enough to have a birthday in December, you may have noticed that your life follows a particular pattern relating to movies, and books, but especially <em>mu-sic</em> which can be seen as <em>12, intentionally so written</em> (as noted above). If your name somehow relates to an animal, then you may be more sensitive than most. My friend the muse has been exploited to provide material for others to profit from, while she has received nothing but pain and suffering. <strong>The only comfort I can give her is that none of what has happened in her life can be blamed on her, as</strong> <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">she never truly had freewill</span></strong>, which I will prove in the following pages. By turning this woman’s world upside-down (ala 12th trump of the tarot) before she ever had a chance to do something worthwhile in her life, a cache of compelling stories was made, from which authors and musicians have profited, while she has received mostly criticism for not being successful herself.</p>
<p>The Muse may just be a real person. Make the muse sick in an emotional/mental way, and there will be plenty of creative inspiration to draw from her, dolling it out to artists who are supported by the media. <strong>Pray for the muse, for she has suffered. </strong>You may not believe what is written here at first, so you may see it as a fictional account, but I ask that you read it with an open mind, and keep positive thoughts for the unfortunate victims of this strange scheme who get no credit for all they have contributed. The items in the numbered list below may not mean much individually, but when taken all together, <strong>it cannot be denied that this woman’s freewill was taken from her without ever having to incarcerate her</strong> and that it was by design. <strong>She was born innocent and was used, abused, and betrayed from the moment of her birth.</strong></p>
<p><em>This is how the muse has been made:</em></p>
<p>1)      Find a woman who wants to place a baby for adoption, who is due in January to have a female child, as females are generally more submissive and therefore easier to manipulate. Born out of wedlock, the child will be viewed as more expendable, due to how the Bible views bastards (see Deuteronomy 23:2), so no one who is not a so-called bastard will care what happens to her anyway. They’ll just be glad it isn’t them, and will be all too happy to participate in the scam against her.</p>
<p>2)      Induce the birthmother to deliver the baby on 12/12, so that the child is born premature and easier to control, and so that this number’s high visibility in the bible and culture can be used to manipulate her ego throughout her life, without her being consciously aware of it. This will also cause her to be metaphorically and metaphysically tied to the words <em>mu</em> and <em>sic </em>(read as 12-intentionally so written), as noted above and also to the 12<sup>th</sup> trump card of the tarot, which in most decks, is an upsidedown figure, and in at least three decks, there is an upsidedown ankh (which is the symbol for life and fertility, and it closely resembles the sign for female), and a serpent at the head of the figure, which could represent either satan, or the so-called serpent class.</p>
<p>3)      Name her something that has a mostly negative connotation in the culture, such as giving her the initials C.A.T., so that the child can be easily associated with such negative ideas as “catty”, “pussy cat”, “scaredy cat”, “cataclysm”, “catastrophe”, and so on. While there are some positive ideas related to the word cat, such as “catalyst” and “catharsis”, the majority are negative. This creates a negative child with a very low self-esteem, who will be easily manipulated by others, much later. <strong>By making her surroundings as miserable as possible, she will question everything she has been told about a loving god</strong>. By associating her to negative things and by using black magic to associate her on the metaphysical level to mu-sic and the tarot, this task can more easily be accomplished as opposed to just setting her up with a family that pays her little attention. The initials idea has the extra benefit of pointing her out as little more than an animal to the perpetrators. Language will be used to manipulate her in other ways, which will be seen in a paragraph farther below.</p>
<p>4)      By tying the child to the 12<sup>th</sup> trump of the Thoth deck (as opposed to other decks), she will be even more unconscious of what is being done to her. It shows a figure upside-down, eyes closed, arms and one leg pinned with nails, and one leg tied to an upside-down ankh. See the following link to understand this concept. <a href="http://www.metacrawler.com/info.metac.t1.1/search/images?q=thoth%20tarot%20hanged%20man&#038;fcoid=408&#038;fcop=topnav&#038;fpid=2" rel="nofollow">http://www.metacrawler.com/info.metac.t1.1/search/images?q=thoth%20tarot%20hanged%20man&#038;fcoid=408&#038;fcop=topnav&#038;fpid=2</a>                                              <strong>The ankh symbolizes life and fertility, and by being attached to it in an upside-down position, her ideas about those concepts will be terribly skewed, and she will not understand why</strong>. It will affect her for her whole life in a negative way, and then she will be blamed for being so negative. Because the 12<sup>th</sup> trump card is known as the Hanged Traitor in most decks, as she gets older, most people will often see her in a negative light, because of the oc-<span style="text-decoration:underline;">cult</span> underpinnings of our <span style="text-decoration:underline;">cult</span>-ure, and because many people she encounters will have seen or studied the tarot by the time she enters her 40’s. It is ironic because she was betrayed the very moment she was born. Since the Thoth tarot deck names this card as “The Dying God”, it will further manipulate her ego, at a later date.</p>
<p>5)      Her adoptive mother, who was physically abused, has a 4/4 birthday, and is therefore connected to the 4<sup>th</sup> trump card, known as The Emperor, giving her way too much power over her adoptive child. To see the mother’s card, The Emperor, from the Thoth deck, follow this link:     <a href="http://www.metacrawler.com/info.metac.t1.1/search/images?fcoid=417&#038;fcop=topnav&#038;fpid=2&#038;q=thoth+tarot+emperor&#038;ql=" rel="nofollow">http://www.metacrawler.com/info.metac.t1.1/search/images?fcoid=417&#038;fcop=topnav&#038;fpid=2&#038;q=thoth+tarot+emperor&#038;ql=</a></p>
<p>6)      Beyond the 12<sup>th</sup> trump card, the subject will be tied to the Thoth tarot deck in general by using her Pythagorean numerology, in which her numbers are 22, 11, 8, and 2. When one considers Oscar Wilde’s assertion that “Life imitates art far more than art imitates life”, the 11<sup>th</sup> trump of the Thoth deck shows a disturbing discrepancy from decks such as the Rider-Waite, in that it turns what is usually “Justice” into “Lust”. Even more disturbing is that the 9/11 tragedy can be read as “no justice”, since <em>nine</em> in German means “no”, and the 11<sup>th</sup> trump card of the tarot traditionally represents justice.</p>
<p>7)      Television (tell-a-vision) will be her primary babysitter, because it has been known to induce a hypnotic state, making the child more susceptible to post-hypnotic suggestion.</p>
<p>8)      Keeping the subject away from any mother figure for the first six weeks of her life (by keeping her in the custody of the adoption agency during this time), ensures an emotional trauma, known as abandonment syndrome, right from the start, making her easily suggestible even as she gets older. This can be seen in studies on monkeys in captivity, taken from their mothers at birth. To see more information on this, follow this link: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Harlow#Partial_and_total_isolation_of_infant_monkeys">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Harlow#Partial_and_total_isolation_of_infant_monkeys</a></p>
<p>9)      Make sure the parents have a history of abuse in their family. An upper-middle class family with the father away on frequent business trips is important for giving the child daddy issues, which will make her easily influenced by boyfriends in the future. A family that keeps a live-in housekeeper is best, that way the child will never have a stable caregiver. They will have money, so that people will think the subject had “every advantage in life”, when the real thing she needed was love and discipline.</p>
<p>10)  Baptize the child in the Catholic faith, even though the parents are known to have affairs on each other, thus confusing the child early on about God and faith. Get her at least as far as first communion, which is a ritual that does have slightly sexual overtones when taken at face value. The family should already have a male child, who is an alter boy. Abused by his mother, he will pass this on to the sister when she is out of babyhood, introducing more traumas into her life. This brother will be about ten years older than the adoptee and will be favored by the mother. Oddly enough, but it will make sense later on, he will give her a dress that closely resembles a wedding dress, when she is about 12 and he is 22.</p>
<p>11)  Make sure the mother uses the Dr. Spock method of child rearing, allowing the infant child to scream herself to sleep, even if left in the crib for an hour or more. This adds to the attachment disorder. The mother will also only use negative feedback to try to bend the child to her will.</p>
<p>12)  Take her from a family that is mostly left-handed, making her the creative right-brained type, but make her write with the right hand against her natural inclination, by telling her that left-handedness is evil. This has the effect of literally and metaphorically taking the already sensitive subject out of her right mind, as evidenced by studies of stroke victims regarding the left hemisphere controlling the right half of the brain and vice versa. It will also affect her natural brain development, her emotional development, and her creativity.  Please see the following link regarding the left and right hemispheres of the brain: <a href="http://psychology.about.com/od/cognitivepsychology/a/left-brain-right-brain.htm" rel="nofollow">http://psychology.about.com/od/cognitivepsychology/a/left-brain-right-brain.htm</a></p>
<p>13)  Manipulating this subject will be made even easier by sending subliminal messages via RFID implants in each ear (which this author has felt and seen), exposing her to too much TV (to be used in concert with these implants), and virtually no parental supervision. Later, this will have the added benefit of scaring the subject out of talking about it; for fear that she will be further harmed by those interested in keeping this quiet.</p>
<p>14)  It would be assumed that the commonly used ritual drowning at three years old would be used to bring a child to a near-death experience, which serves to make the subject more sensitive than most other children, and it opens the child up to spiritual communication and/or demonic possession.</p>
<p>15)  Use programming (mind control and ritual abuse) to further associate the subject to her initials, connecting her more to her baser instincts, and ensuring she has issues with sex and procreation (of course the overly sexual nature of TV, music and movies will compound this effect). This will effectively subvert her desire to succeed in other areas of her life, and most likely cause her to want to have children before she is ready, resulting in the likelihood of abortion and/or adoption, which adds guilt to her already low self-esteem. An added benefit will be that this will cause her to be too embarrassed to talk about her issues, thus limiting exposure of those in control.</p>
<p>16)  Use parents who have affairs, creating even more confusion for the catholic child who needs her parents to be good role models. A divorce will be likely, with the child being kept with a narcissistic and self-serving, 3-pack a day smoking mother with a gambling habit (The Emperor) who doesn’t have to work, who spends more time with her friends than her own daughter (who will be a latchkey kid after the divorce). The mother will call her stupid all too often, to make up for her own lack of parenting skills, and will tell her that she is never going to amount to anything (in essence these are curses). The daughter will end up with asthma and an addiction to cigarettes (thanks to mom’s smoking three packs a day and having smokers in the house almost everyday since the child was a newborn), as well as an unhealthy ego, no self-esteem, and an inability to adapt to the world around her: fertile ground for what is to come as she gets older. The psychological damage done by her own mom calling her stupid will take her from being in the top 2% of her class to being completely average by the time she graduates.</p>
<p>17)  After the divorce, the adoptive mother will move into a condo and install an overabundance of mirrors (i.e. mirrored bedroom suites, mirrored wallpaper, mirrored switch panels, mirrored closet doors, mirrored coffee table, etc), so that she will become somewhat of a narcissist, making it easy to label her. At 14, her mother will use her to sell hotdogs at construction sites, while wearing a bikini. She will be introduced to an adult male who will date-rape her when she is 16 and still a virgin; an easily accomplished task when one considers this child is lacking a father figure.</p>
<p>18)  By this point, we have a narcissistic rebel with a very unhealthy ego, who will easily end up in some negative music genre, such as punk, which is riddled with angry music. Check in on her periodically, to see if she has certain habits, like cutting herself or twisting her hair into little knots and then ripping them out. If she is doing those things, then the project will most likely be successful.</p>
<p>19)  By the end of her childhood, say, while she is seventeen, the mother will magically lose her wallet with $800 and credit cards in it (keep in mind she has a history of gambling), and she will blame the child for stealing it. She will allow the police to take her daughter down for a confession. The child will be so nervous about the prospect of going to jail that she will flunk a lie detector test, even though she is telling the truth about not doing the crime. The cops will make her give a false confession by saying it’s the only way to stay out of jail, making the child see early on that she has been used as a scapegoat.</p>
<p>20)  Make sure the child has the <strong>illusion of freewill</strong> so that she will internalize all of the blame for her bad behaviors, which are obviously the result of her being the unwitting participant in this mind control program. Let’s face it- we all know this subject was never truly given free will, given the circumstances of her life.</p>
<p>21)  A sensitive (originally left-handed) person, our subject is likely to be an artist. When she goes to college, we can insert into that school, a person with the surname “Skinner” (as in “skin the cat”), who will not only introduce her to a boyfriend to sidetrack her, but later, after having a child they have placed for adoption, this “friend” will introduce her to heroin which will sabotage her career and ruin her life completely. By now, this subject fits a profile, making it much easier for us to keep her down.</p>
<p>22)  After facing the fact that her art career has failed, she will work various jobs, for which she will be grossly undervalued and underpaid. This will cause her to go back to drugs in order to sooth herself away from the sadness and anger she correctly feels for her lot in life, still blaming herself despite the fact that it was never her fault. At this point, she has not made the connection between the person named “Skinner” and her own initials, “C.A.T.”, and its impact on her art career. Meanwhile, she will still work hard for her employers, always being one of the top performers at her jobs.</p>
<p>23)  She will get to a point when, after her daughter is born, she wants to work at home to be closer to her child, wanting to be a better parent to her daughter than what she had experienced in her own life. She’ll get a job on the internet, which will expose her to all sorts of information, confusing for a person who has been in a spiritual crisis her whole life. We can introduce some controlled opposition groups via the internet, to make the subject believe that there are people out there who actually care about the truth. After seeing information on Sumeria and Egypt in relation to Satanism, and while being in a so-called spiritual email group with ulterior motives that discusses many of these same ideas, it will be easy to use mind control to get her to “dedicate her soul to satan”, even though she was actually searching for a higher power. Being in a reversed position for her entire life, and given that she could never truly feel God in the churches or in her own family; it should be easy to do this to someone who was originally such a loving and caring child. Later, she will see the leader of that supposed spiritual group confess online to using “mindbending” and “harvesting human souls”. By this time, you the reader can see how someone who has been metaphorically upside-down all her life might make a dire mistake such as this, extreme as it may sound.</p>
<p>At one point, she will be tortured in her privates during a surgery (it was either right after my daughter was delivered and I was on a heavy sedative, or during a cervical dysplasia procedure). This will destroy her root chakra and cause a condition called &#8220;vulvodynia&#8221; which is delayed pain that results from trauma in the area. The memory of it, since she was under anesthetic, will be repressed, but will lurk in her subconscious mind for years, until it will eventually come out as a flashback (I have flashbacks of what they did to me now, but only a very few people will believe me).</p>
<p>24)  Because she is in her forties at this point, she will begin to have breakthrough memories of how she has been physically, metaphysically, psychically, and spiritually harmed in the past, but no one will believe her when she begins to post her experiences to online email groups that purport to expose conspiracy and espouse truth. She will eventually turn to one or more of those online groups/personalities, hoping for some kind of help; a way out of her nightmare. Unfortunately for her, those she turns to are mostly actors who refuse to acknowledge the sad truth of her situation. They will dismiss her as crazy, while most cannot avoid the facts of her life add up to some sort of mind control.</p>
<p>25)  She will be told that her problems are all her fault, that she must “live life on life’s terms”, but that is akin to “cutting the legs of the sheep and then blaming the sheep for not being able to stand”, as I heard in a Gnostic Media interview a few years back. <strong>“Living life on life’s terms” presupposes an individual has free will, which this subject has never truly had.</strong> How can one be able to “live life on life’s terms” when life’s terms have been so warped for her by others?</p>
<p>26)  When she begins to see how she has been an unwitting participant in this program of creating an artificially induced depressed muse, and when she begins to see how all of her inspiration has been gleaned from her and dolled out to others who are supported by media moguls, the implants can then be used to audibly convince her that she is the responsible party in all of this, which will help drive her into a deeper depression, and will make her think she is schizophrenic. The voices delivered via these implants will at first tell her she is Mary, then Jesus, God, an angel, a demon, and then Satan himself, which reminds this author of a band called <strong>Jesus and the Mary Chain</strong>.</p>
<p>27)  By this point, the victim is beginning to behave strangely. Anyone she is friends with will be made to turn on her so she will not be able to get much help. Her boyfriend and father of her child will repeatedly try to have her locked up, causing her to lose her job and have no way to support herself. The voices will then use this as proof that she is nothing more than a loser. He will then take her daughter away, moving out of their overpriced home, letting it go into foreclosure, and she will be stuck there with no vehicle, no power, and no water.</p>
<p>28)  At this point, pain will be introduced into her pelvic region (described as feeling like electroshocks, complete with swelling and visible contractions), which suspiciously won’t be diagnosed by doctors, so that while she has been clean, she will be forced to go back to using some sort of painkiller to get any relief from the torture, although she tries to remain clean as often and for as long as she can. While in the foreclosed house, in pain, with no power or water, police will be sent, often enough to scare her. They will even go so far as to fly a helicopter with the spotlight pointing directly in the windows of the house for about a half an hour. This will traumatize her even further.</p>
<p>29)  The voices will remind her of her history of being a drug addict and of having sexual issues, making her afraid to come out with the information she now knows to be true. The voices will tell her that she is being set up for some crime she didn’t commit and, due to her history noted above, she won’t be able to trust the authorities. This is the fear put into her to add to what will finally kill her.</p>
<p>30)  Eventually, she will begin to have flashbacks of ritual torture done to her by her mother. Of course, she won’t be able to prove these events, so she will look even more deranged if she tries to speak of it to anyone.</p>
<p>31)  She will beg God for forgiveness, hoping that He sees how she was abused since childhood, how she was involved in a cult (in order to get her to sign the contract with Satan), and how she does not deserve to remain in this hell any longer.</p>
<p>32)  At this point, she will be killed, albeit very slowly. This will be accomplished by luring her with a hero type, who’s voice will be delivered to her via the implants, telling her lies to keep her from coming out about her experiences because she thinks she is going to be rescued. Then other voices will laugh at her, telling her there could be no way this man would ever care for her. Then they will fill her with fear of going to hell and/or jail. They will remind her that she is “no good” and worthless. These things will help to overwhelm her already overloaded system. It is a form of torture. They will blame her for not being able to quit smoking, but then continue to attack her with threats to her life, freedom, and her very soul, making it impossible for her to quit this nervous habit.</p>
<p>33)  She will at some point hear a voice saying that they are going to make a liar out of her. People will even call her a “storyteller”. She will find it near impossible to find real help from anyone. The thought of eternal damnation will drive her mad and adversely affect her health; however, she will still try to maintain a somewhat positive attitude, despite overwhelming odds.</p>
<p>34)  In the end, we will write her a happy ending to her story; one in which she may still die, but she/her soul will go to a better place where her wishes finally do become a reality. By the way, she has told me that her greatest wish is for things to always get better for everyone, for everyone to finally meet and be with their true soul-mate, and for all to find their own real happiness. Perhaps hers will ultimately be a story of redemption, whereby “God has drug her through hell to get her to heaven”, as one friend once told her.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;"> </span></strong></p>
<p>Before she began to uncover what was done to her, my friend was finally becoming a positive person, after so many years of negativity. She had grown tired of all the conspiracy theories found online and was searching for a higher power. The problem was that she had been upside-down and never knew it. It was in her late thirties that she began a search for the God-force, never knowing that she was an <strong>unwitting a sacrifice</strong> for those unknown to her to get away with horrific crimes against her very soul, which they had been doing on a metaphysical level throughout her life, and from a safe distance, by using music, television, and movies, but also by using rituals involving tarot cards and black magic, as mentioned.</p>
<p>Some of the musical artists she cites as having connections to her life include the following (a partial list): Peter Gabriel, Kate Bush (“Experiment IV”, “Waking the Witch”), Tool, A Perfect Circle, Chevelle, Cavo, Pearl Jam, Temple of the Dog, Depeche Mode, Alice in Chains, Smashing Pumpkins, Metallica, The Pixies, Nirvana, Hole, and more recently, TI, Niki Menaj, Eminem, Dr Dre, The Cataracs, Nellie, Snoop Dog, Katy Perry, etc. There is even an acquaintance named Brian Repetto (a friend of the Skinner character and also of her ex-boyfriend), who has a failing record label known as “Screw Music Forever”, which is disturbing given the meaning of the words mu and sic, which we now know can be read (or felt) as “12-as written”.</p>
<p>While I first thought of her as a hypocrite and a loser who just wanted to blame others for her misery, I now realize that, for her entire life, she has been an experiment for some sick minds to enjoy. It is as if her whole life has been “intentionally so written” at her expense, so that others could make their fortunes by gleaning their inspiration from her sorrow. She had been unwittingly tied to the tarot, the bible, language, and occult rituals, all the while living her life in absolute ignorance of the spiritual torture that had been taking place since her birth. Once she became cognizant of these facts, she became a “Targeted Individual” (known as TI’s in the internet community) for all sorts of electronic harassment and gang stalking, as well as directed energy weapons, which have caused her health to go downhill considerably.</p>
<p>One look at the 12<sup>th</sup> card in the major arcana of most tarot decks shows what was done on a metaphysical level which had the effect of torturing this woman’s soul. This card goes by the title, “The Hanged Man”, “The Dying God”, and also “The Hanged Traitor”. On a metaphysical level, this impacts the victims in ways unimaginable to most, and it speaks to the whole idea of how it was “intentionally so written” (or drawn), as noted above. How they can justify doing this to a female, I will never know, but they did, and they profited from it, which makes this the worst kind of evil imaginable, because it caused her sadness, her negativity, and most of her emotional difficulties, resulting in addiction. Insidious because it was not only done to her the very moment she was born and affected her throughout her life, but she then also received all of the blame for not being the success she would have been had these things not happened to her.</p>
<p>To do this to a human being, to artificially induce someone to be abnormal, just so they could glean the resulting dramatic inspiration from her psyche, to be used in music, movies, and television (tell-a-vision) goes well beyond the parameters of what is commonly thought of as criminal behavior, and because it occurs on a metaphysical and metaphoric level, it can only be termed a “meta-crime”. The victim is affected by these art forms, and then affects them in turn, never understanding why she sees her life reflected in the music she hears and the movies and television shows she sees. The victim has no recourse because the proof, while it seems undeniable to me, is seen on such a large scale that most people are unwilling to open their minds enough to see it. If you are not born on a 12/12 birthday and given the initials C.A.T., then it wouldn’t affect you the same way it has affected her. No one believes her because it isn’t easy to see how this could be accomplished. Most people do not think in those terms, so they label her as a loser and a nut case, causing her even more psychological damage.</p>
<p>One example of how this woman didn’t truly have freewill is shown in one of the three Magus cards of the Thoth tarot deck. This peculiar card shows a woman, surrounded by an image of a transparent bear, with the winged disk (found in Sumerian and Egyptian glyphs and seals) in front of her crotch, in the formation of the caduceus, with the two serpents entwining a pole, going to the bottom of the card. The woman looks like a so-called friend of the victim I am discussing, and the image in front of her crotch closely resembles that of a tattoo on my friend’s back. They had gone to art school together, and that this woman was somehow able to steal ideas from her, using them for her own gain. As mentioned above, her initials spell CAT, and the friend’s last name is Skinner; A cruel irony considering the phrase “skin the cat”, the fact that she introduced the subject to heroin as well as the man who would eventually be in on her downfall, and also considering the name “Skinner” in relation to the notions of “operant conditioning”. “The Devil” card in this deck, 15<sup>th</sup> card of the major arcana, shows the devil behind a similar winged disk. Since she saw this deck, she has told me that she felt like she was being “screwed by others in some way”, her whole life. While no one seems to believe her, it looks to be true since her 12/12 birthday is seen repetitively in the bible and in our culture, and her initials are commonly seen in other literature and in language. She fears that this has made her some sort of target, garnering unwanted negative attention, as she hears people and/or spirits blaming her for things that are well beyond her control.</p>
<p>My friend has told me that she was adopted and has the records to prove it. Given what I know about child trafficking, it is very plausible that she is the victim of Ritual Abuse and Mind Control (RA/MC), making her the unwitting participant in what I can only call a “meta-experiment”, causing her to be an unwell person throughout her life. It is those involved in setting her up to be a muse, by the methods shown in the list above, and those who made it so that she was never able to profit from her own ideas, who should be held liable for her problems that would have never occurred had she truly been given free will; a concept that most people take for granted. When I reexamine the list above, it becomes glaringly obvious that this woman never had free will! When one sees all the facts together like that, the truth about what happened to her cannot be denied!</p>
<p>When one looks at the English language, it is easy to see that the word culture contains the word cult within it, and that it also denotes a type of experiment such as what is found in a pitri dish. Other examples of how our language may be negatively affecting us on a subliminal level (some more than others, depending on their names and birthdates) show how often negative root words are found in other words, as shown here: Chill, Bill, Pill, Till, Mill, Spill, which contain “ill”; Cow, Chow, Blow, Pow, Now, Sow, Meow, which contain “ow” in them (in our subject’s case, I can ask, “why does the cat say me-ow?”); Charm, Pharmacy, which contain “harm”, Mark, March, Mars, Martin, Mary, Marion, which contain “mar”. It remains to be seen whether our language was devised to have these effects or if it was simply an unfortunate accident, but this could have disastrous consequences if one has been purposely made extra sensitive, as was our subject, which might’ve been caused at least in part, by her initials spelling CAT. Our language may not affect the general public as it has our subject, due to her name being related to an animal and animals are generally thought of as extra-sensitive. However, I do think that people have been affected by our language.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that, as I type this, this woman is awaiting a 2.5 million dollar award from her mother’s estate from a tobacco lawsuit, money she will probably never see, since she lost her job and her health has declined considerably since she began to learn of her unfortunate situation. This is in large part due to the drain on her occurring on a vibrational level as the energy vampires continue to attack her on the etheric plane by sending her negative thought forms. They threaten her with comments such as, “I hope you like spiders”, and berate her with statements like, “it might help if you knew you were never loved”, and “it puts the lotion in the basket”, a line from the movie <em>Silence of the Lambs</em>.</p>
<p>Her birthday, as tied to the tarot, has caused her to be metaphorically upside-down all her life, while her initials have had the unfortunate effect of relating her to things such as <em>pussy-cat</em>, <em>catty</em>, <em>catastrophe</em>, <em>cataclysm</em>, and so on (she happens to be <em>catholic</em>, by the way). The fact that her upbringing was lacking at best did not help matters any. As an aside, there are these Pokemon called “Mew”, and one called “Mew-Two”, which are both types of cats, which helped her to make the connection between her birthday, initials, and the words “mu” and “sic”.</p>
<p>The question I have here is this: Is there any hope for this person? She has put up with so much loss in her life and it seems that she was made to do things she would have never had done had she truly been given freewill. Her deep connection with that #12 card of the major arcana of the tarot seems to have had its disturbing effects on her whole life, even though she had never seen these cards until much later in life. <strong>By being in this upside-down position, by being associated with the word “music” (as noted above), and by being negatively associated with her initials, she has had a rough way to go, prompting her to, when she felt the most desperate and lost, sign the proverbial “deal with the devil” because she was looking for God in a world where everything looked insane to her.</strong> She now lives in fear for her life, her freedom, and her very soul. There must be some hope for her, as she has suffered more than enough in my opinion.</p>
<p>Another thing to consider is that these implants on her head are palpable. She hears voices and believes that they have been coming through these things throughout her life, on a subliminal level, negatively influencing her decisions. These are the same voices that told her to get the Thoth tarot deck. While it did help her to see how and why life has seemed completely upside-down to her, it also served to manipulate her ego in a negative way. Now that she is conscious of these voices, they seem to constantly attack her, blaming her for things that could not have been her fault, when one considers the numbered list above. In actuality, the more one examines the facts above, the clearer it becomes that this is a “meta-murder”, for lack of a better term. Considering the fact that her own brother said (when he answered his sister’s phone call), “You won’t live”, and the fact that they are due to inherit a 5 million dollar award from a lawsuit in which her deceased mother was involved (which they are to split), and the fact that he is the executor of the estate, attests to the idea that this is indeed a “meta-murder”, and that my friend is the victim.</p>
<p>As an observer to this maligned person’s story, I would like someone to write a happy ending for the muses in our culture; for I am sure there must be more than one. I will begin one, but <strong>I am curious how many people who have benefitted from the muses would be willing to somehow pay them back</strong>. It is something that should be considered in my opinion.</p>
<p>In the end, I choose to write a happy ending for my friend, the muse, and indeed, for all of the muses. Instead of being metaphorically ripped apart, let them be found by love and compassion. Let the muses be granted forgiveness for their bad behaviors and decisions, with the knowledge that they were made to be ultra-sensitive and unconscious in the first place, which is a bad combination. Let the muses receive some sort of justice for what was done to them against their freewill. Relieve them of their pain and suffering, for it has gone on long enough. Let people stop blaming them for not being successful in their own right, knowing that they, the muses, have already given completely of themselves for the benefit of others. Let them be free of any lasting punishment, for it must be known that nothing can be blamed on them. Let her beneficiaries give something back in exchange for all they have gained, as it might very well be in their karmic best interest to do so.</p>
<p>Finally, if a muse has mistaken Satan for God because she has been hanging upside-down, and was taken out of her right mind her whole life, may God forgive her and take her to heaven quickly. Let God forgive her for being confused about the various discrepancies and contradictions in the bible. Let God forgive her for being angry and sad her whole life. She knows that it was men who wrote the bible and not God. She also knows that <strong>history is written by the winners and invariably seems to paint the losers in untrue and unfavorable ways</strong>. Truth shall overcome the evil lies told to discredit those who gave everything of themselves and received nothing in return. The muse shall be rewarded for all that she has given, from which so many have profited. God must see how she has been victimized and let her finally win her heaven in the end. That is the happy ending she deserves after all she has given. God save the Muse and quickly!</p>
