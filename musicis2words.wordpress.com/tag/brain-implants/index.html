<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Trauma and Its Effects on the Psyche/Spirit</strong>  </span></p>
<p>(Links to resources at bottom of article)</p>
<p>Most people these days understand that <em>trauma</em> has <em>psychological effects</em>. If you&#8217;ve been reading my other articles, then you understand that the word <em>psyche</em> derives from both Greek and Latin words that refer to &#8220;<em>spirit</em>&#8220;.</p>
<p><strong><em>Psychology</em> is therefore, the study of the <em>psyche</em> or <em>spirit</em>. </strong></p>
<p><em>Trauma</em> in childhood is recognized in the psychological community as having a negative impact on behavior, causing things like PTSD, Depression, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Borderline Personality Disorder, Antisocial Personality Disorder, Paranoid Personality Disorder, and Schizoid Personality Disorder, to name a few. I suspect that the more trauma a person has in their life, whether in childhood or adulthood, the more problems will manifest in their <em>psyche</em> (<em>spirit</em>), and in their behavior, causing them to be prescribed multiple psych drugs over their lifetimes.</p>
<p>Is this some sort of a formula or what?</p>
<p>While I do have some strong misgivings about the discipline of psychology and their over-emphasis on drugs for behavioral disorders, when there are no real objective tests for most of these disorders, this does not make <em>psychology</em> an invalid science&#8230; just a flawed &amp; corrupted one, in need of more thorough oversight in the community, since it seems like the whole discipline has fallen into the hands of big pharma.</p>
<p>People with <em>PTSD</em> have been found to have elevated stress hormones (cortisol) which can lead to heart disease, and also to the shrinkage of the hippocampus (which affects the transfer of facts from short-term to long-term memory).</p>
<p><strong>Trauma &amp; Circumcision:</strong></p>
<p>After doing some research on the subject of <em>trauma &amp; PTSD</em>, I have noticed that the most common groups studied in relation to this are veterans &amp; children. I find it interesting that no one seems to be studying the effects of trauma in infancy. I realize that this may be more difficult to get anecdotal information from infants, however, one could measure the amounts of cortisol in the brain before &amp; after a <em>circumcision</em>, for example, or before and after a child is taken from its natural mother during the adoption process.</p>
<p>I mention circumcision because it is the mutilation of a male child&#8217;s penis, usually done immediately after birth, unless the child is an orthodox Jew, who will get this done at 13 years old, viewing it as a &#8220;rite of passage&#8221;. When I consider circumcision, I cannot help but consider the long term psychological impact of this practice on a newborn baby. Sadly, the families who allow it &amp; the doctors who perform it apparently do not question the ramifications of this wicked trauma done on a newborn. I think this is why so many males don&#8217;t question going off to war&#8230; they&#8217;ve already been prepped with violence.</p>
<p>Circumcision is a physical assault on the most sensitive part of a male child&#8217;s body, which then makes it a violation of the psyche as well. If considered in combination with the existence of the chakras, this mutilation of an organ in the <em>root chakra</em> has affects on emotions involving <em>security</em> needs. <em>Trauma</em> at such a young age, whether through circumcision or through the unceremonious routines of measuring &amp; weighing, blood testing, a vitamin K shot, vaccines, &amp; drops or ointment in the eyes, would seem to have some sort of emotional impact on the <em>psyche</em> of a newborn baby that is supposed to be experiencing its first few hours bonding with its mother.</p>
<p><strong>About the root chakra:</strong> &#8220;<em>The root chakra is responsible for your sense of belonging, safety, and security in the world</em>.  It’s main concern is <em>survival of the self</em>. (Emphasis Mine) The health of our blood, immune system, bones, joints and spine is dependent on the emotions associated with this chakra. It envelops the body’s basic needs for safety, money, sexuality, groundedness and boundaries.  People who have trouble with their first chakra may not have developed a strong identity and have not discovered their life purpose.  If they are too yin they may be ungrounded.  If they are too yang there might be too much attachment to material things, too much self-indulgence and a preoccupation with satisfaction of their own needs.&#8221;  &#8211; from naturalhealthtechniques.com (link below)</p>
<p>So any trauma in early infancy would naturally have effects on the root chakra, causing security issues in the psyche, which then ripens them up to be conditioned into good little consumers, who are very needy, and often greedy.</p>
<p>Circumcision would of course have the strongest impact of all the &#8220;routine&#8221; procedures done to a newborn after birth. Have you ever seen a circumcision on a newborn baby? The one I saw was awful, &amp; proved to me that babies do feel pain, regardless of what the doctor may tell you. The question is, what are the long term effects of such a traumatic procedure on an infant&#8217;s psyche?</p>
<p>It is my feeling that trauma in infancy &amp; early childhood has a tendency to soften up the mind &amp; make people more easily controlled by the <em>societal conditioning</em>, which is in turn, controlled by the so-called &#8220;<em>hidden hand</em>&#8221; (corporate elites), through the use of education, religion, television, movies, music, literature, &amp; yes, even through the use of <em>brain implants</em>, on par with the research of people like <em>Dr. Jose Delgado</em> &amp; <em>Dr. Ewen Cameron</em>. It sets in the newborn&#8217;s mind, a state of shock, coloring almost everything that happens shortly after birth, including the bonding experience with the parents. I suspect that the traumatized brain of an infant or young child is much more easily hypnotized by the flicker-rate of the television, which is known to induce a trance-like state in those who watch it.</p>
<p><strong>Trauma &amp; Adoption:</strong></p>
<p>There are other traumas that occur during infancy, such as <em>adoption</em>. Now recognized as a traumatic experience by many metal health professionals, with life-long consequences, adoption has a deep psychological impact on the child, leading to a disproportionate number of adoptees seeking help for mental health issues. Adoptees often end up with various forms of attachment disorder, addictions, depression, &amp; obsessive behaviors, to name a few.</p>
<p>While the damage from the aforementioned traumas may have already been done to the psyche, &amp; while some of these people do need medication for the deep psychological issues caused by these events in order to be functional, would it not make perfect sense to examine evidence (measuring cortisol) that is now available with relation to <em>trauma &amp; its effects on the brain</em>?</p>
<p><strong>Trauma Based Mind Control:</strong></p>
<p>Most people who have done any research into the subject of <em>trauma-based mind control</em> understand that it is a powerful way to alter the mind. The more sensational cases of people, like Cathy O&#8217;Brien or Brice Taylor, speak of the splitting of the mind into <em>multiple personalities</em> through the use of trauma. <strong>I contend that the creation of MPD in a person is not necessary for mind control to be achieved</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Learned Helplessness:</strong></p>
<p>Evidence of this concept can be found in the way the American public mostly sat back &amp; watched as their freedoms were eroded in the years following September 11th, 2001. Had they not been repeatedly exposed to the trauma of the event at the World Trade Center, would it have been as easy for those in power to erode American liberties? Does the fact that the United States has been at war for so many years now have a general impact on the <em>collective psyche</em> of its inhabitants, a population which was raised on television? Is it possible that trauma delivered on such a large scale has anchored trauma in infancy or childhood, &amp; induced a state of <em>learned helplessness</em>?</p>
<p>&#8220;The concept of learned helplessness was discovered accidentally by psychologists Martin Seligman and Steven F. Maier. They had initially observed helpless behavior in dogs that were classically conditioned to expect an electrical shock after hearing a tone. Later, the dogs were placed in a shuttlebox that contained two chambers separated by a low barrier. The floor was electrified on one side, and not on the other. The dogs previously subjected to the classical conditioning made no attempts to escape, even though avoiding the shock simply involved jumping over a low barrier.&#8221; &#8211; from psychology.about.com (link below)</p>
<p>The above study was done in 1967.</p>
<p>Please reread that above paragraph &amp; let the information sink in. It shows that <em>repeated trauma</em> can induce a state of <em>learned helplessness</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Trauma &amp; Television in Conditioning:</strong></p>
<p>Traumatize a baby &amp; then sit it in front of the television for a while. Most people go into a sort of trance when watching television anyway, due to the <em>flicker-rate</em> (aka &#8220;refresh-rate&#8221;) effect. Since the child&#8217;s mind is like a sponge, it will suck up all the programming you want. Granted, this is a highly contested statement about television <em>programming</em>, however, it should be considered that, at the very least, watching TV can put a person into a hypnotic, trance-like state, causing things being said to them afterwards to have the possibility of becoming a <em>post-hypnotic suggestion</em>. Hence, advertising.</p>
<p>Let me illustrate this idea: Let&#8217;s say you are a 13 year old kid, watching a couple of hours of TV before bed. Right after you turn that TV off, you hear your dad complaining that you didn&#8217;t take the trash out or get the mail. He gets angry &amp; says that you&#8217;re stupid a number of times. Does this statement that you are stupid have an increased possibility of becoming a <em>self-fulfilling prophecy</em> because you were just in a trance for the past 2 hours before hearing it? Would there be a difference in the effect depending on whether you experienced trauma in infancy or early childhood? Could this have something to do with the reason many victims of mind control programs cite the <em>ritual drowning</em> at 3 years old as being one of their experiences?</p>
<p>It seems to me that trauma has as one of its effects a type of <em>fracture</em> <em>of the psyche</em> or spirit. Setting newborn babies up in this way has caused most of us to end up with an unnatural state of need &amp; insecurity, which is then played on by all sorts of advertising making people desire things they do not need. It also has, as an unfortunate (but possibly intended) side effect: a tendency to cause symptoms such as obsessions, attention deficit disorders, depression, hoarding, paranoia, eating disorders, drug &amp; alcohol addiction, shopping addictions, social anxiety, &amp; other behaviors categorized as <em>mental dysfunction</em>. In reality, these behavioral problems are merely a reaction to adverse stimuli that has occurred since birth, &amp; in some cases, over the course of a lifetime.</p>
<p><strong>Natural Trauma: </strong></p>
<p>There are plenty of traumas that are natural aspects of life. These include birth, loss of a parent, injuries, etc. These natural traumas may cause some issues with the psyche, but they will be healed over time. The problem is that there are so many orchestrated &amp; manipulated traumas in a person&#8217;s life these days, including the examples I mentioned above, that the psyche never gets a real chance to heal.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion: </strong></p>
<p>Between trauma in infancy &amp; early childhood, and trauma witnessed in the news every day, it becomes clear to see an atmosphere of terror is causing these mental/emotional/spiritual issues to manifest in people. The event of what happened to the <em>World Trade Center</em> marked a turning point in traumatizing the masses to allow those with power to enslave the people in such a way, that they would not even recognize their slavery.</p>
<p>Is it any wonder that so many people these days are running to the psych doctor for medication to alleviate their symptoms?</p>
<p>Is it any wonder that people have allowed their civil liberties to be eroded, given the discovery of learned helplessness as related to trauma? This has been going on longer than anyone realizes, &amp; has far reaching implications.</p>

<p><strong>Trauma and Its Effects on the Psyche/Spirit</strong></p>
<p>(Links to resources at bottom of article)</p>
<p>Most people these days understand that <em>trauma</em> has <em>psychological effects</em>. If you&#8217;ve been reading my other articles, then you understand that the word <em>psyche</em> derives from both Greek and Latin words that refer to &#8220;<em>spirit</em>&#8220;.</p>
<p><strong><em>Psychology</em> is therefore, the study of the <em>psyche</em> or <em>spirit</em>. </strong></p>
<p><em>Trauma</em> in childhood is recognized in the psychological community as having a negative impact on behavior, causing things like PTSD, Depression, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Borderline Personality Disorder, Antisocial Personality Disorder, Paranoid Personality Disorder, and Schizoid Personality Disorder, to name a few. I suspect that the more trauma a person has in their life, whether in childhood or adulthood, the more problems will manifest in their <em>psyche</em> (<em>spirit</em>), and in their behavior, causing them to be prescribed multiple psych drugs over their lifetimes.</p>
<p>Is this some sort of a formula or what?</p>
<p>While I do have some strong misgivings about the discipline of psychology and their over-emphasis on drugs for behavioral disorders, when there are no real objective tests for most of these disorders, this does not make <em>psychology</em> an invalid science&#8230; just a flawed &amp; corrupted one, in need of more thorough oversight in the community, since it seems like the whole discipline has fallen into the hands of big pharma.</p>
<p>People with <em>PTSD</em> have been found to have elevated stress hormones (cortisol) which can lead to heart disease, and also to the shrinkage of the hippocampus (which affects the transfer of facts from short-term to long-term memory).</p>
<p><strong>Trauma &amp; Circumcision:</strong></p>
<p>After doing some research on the subject of <em>trauma &amp; PTSD</em>, I have noticed that the most common groups studied in relation to this are veterans &amp; children. I find it interesting that no one seems to be studying the effects of trauma in infancy. I realize that this may be more difficult to get anecdotal information from infants, however, one could measure the amounts of cortisol in the brain before &amp; after a <em>circumcision</em>, for example, or before and after a child is taken from its natural mother during the adoption process.</p>
<p>I mention circumcision because it is the mutilation of a male child&#8217;s penis, usually done immediately after birth, unless the child is an orthodox Jew, who will get this done at 13 years old, viewing it as a &#8220;rite of passage&#8221;. When I consider circumcision, I cannot help but consider the long term psychological impact of this practice on a newborn baby. Sadly, the families who allow it &amp; the doctors who perform it apparently do not question the ramifications of this wicked trauma done on a newborn. I think this is why so many males don&#8217;t question going off to war&#8230; they&#8217;ve already been prepped with violence.</p>
<p>Circumcision is a physical assault on the most sensitive part of a male child&#8217;s body, which then makes it a violation of the psyche as well. If considered in combination with the existence of the chakras, this mutilation of an organ in the <em>root chakra</em> has affects on emotions involving <em>security</em> needs. <em>Trauma</em> at such a young age, whether through circumcision or through the unceremonious routines of measuring &amp; weighing, blood testing, a vitamin K shot, vaccines, &amp; drops or ointment in the eyes, would seem to have some sort of emotional impact on the <em>psyche</em> of a newborn baby that is supposed to be experiencing its first few hours bonding with its mother.</p>
<p><strong>About the root chakra:</strong> &#8220;<em>The root chakra is responsible for your sense of belonging, safety, and security in the world</em>.  It’s main concern is <em>survival of the self</em>. (Emphasis Mine) The health of our blood, immune system, bones, joints and spine is dependent on the emotions associated with this chakra. It envelops the body’s basic needs for safety, money, sexuality, groundedness and boundaries.  People who have trouble with their first chakra may not have developed a strong identity and have not discovered their life purpose.  If they are too yin they may be ungrounded.  If they are too yang there might be too much attachment to material things, too much self-indulgence and a preoccupation with satisfaction of their own needs.&#8221;  &#8211; from naturalhealthtechniques.com (link below)</p>
<p>So any trauma in early infancy would naturally have effects on the root chakra, causing security issues in the psyche, which then ripens them up to be good little consumers, who are very needy, and often greedy.</p>
<p>Circumcision would of course have the strongest impact of all the &#8220;routine&#8221; procedures done to a newborn after birth. Have you ever seen a circumcision on a newborn baby? The one I saw was awful, &amp; proved to me that babies do feel pain, regardless of what the doctor may tell you. The question is, what are the long term effects of such a traumatic procedure on an infant&#8217;s psyche?</p>
<p>It is my feeling that trauma in infancy &amp; early childhood has a tendency to soften up the mind &amp; make people more easily controlled by the <em>societal conditioning</em>, which is in turn, controlled by the so-called &#8220;<em>hidden hand</em>&#8221; (corporate elites), through the use of education, religion, television, movies, music, literature, &amp; yes, even through the use of <em>brain implants</em>, on par with the research of people like <em>Dr. Jose Delgado</em> &amp; <em>Dr. Ewen Cameron</em>. It sets in the newborn&#8217;s mind, a state of shock, coloring almost everything that happens shortly after birth, including the bonding experience with the parents. I suspect that the traumatized brain of an infant or young child is much more easily hypnotized by the flicker-rate of the television, which is known to induce a trance-like state in those who watch it.</p>
<p><strong>Trauma &amp; Adoption:</strong></p>
<p>There are other traumas that occur during infancy, such as <em>adoption</em>. Now recognized as a traumatic experience by many metal health professionals, with life-long consequences, adoption has a deep psychological impact on the child, leading to a disproportionate number of adoptees seeking help for mental health issues. Adoptees often end up with various forms of attachment disorder, addictions, depression, &amp; obsessive behaviors, to name a few.</p>
<p>While the damage from the aforementioned traumas may have already been done to the psyche, &amp; while some of these people do need medication for the deep psychological issues caused by these events in order to be functional, would it not make perfect sense to examine evidence (measuring cortisol) that is now available with relation to <em>trauma &amp; its effects on the brain</em>?</p>
<p><strong>Trauma Based Mind Control:</strong></p>
<p>Most people who have done any research into the subject of <em>trauma-based mind control</em> understand that it is a powerful way to alter the mind. The more sensational cases of people, like Cathy O&#8217;Brien or Brice Taylor, speak of the splitting of the mind into <em>multiple personalities</em> through the use of trauma. <strong>I contend that the creation of MPD in a person is not necessary for mind control to be achieved</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Learned Helplessness:</strong></p>
<p>Evidence of this concept can be found in the way the American public mostly sat back &amp; watched as their freedoms were eroded in the years following September 11th, 2001. Had they not been repeatedly exposed to the trauma of the event at the World Trade Center, would it have been as easy for those in power to erode American liberties? Does the fact that the United States has been at war for so many years now have a general impact on the <em>collective psyche</em> of its inhabitants, a population which was raised on television? Is it possible that trauma delivered on such a large scale has anchored trauma in infancy or childhood, &amp; induced a state of <em>learned helplessness</em>?</p>
<p>&#8220;The concept of learned helplessness was discovered accidentally by psychologists Martin Seligman and Steven F. Maier. They had initially observed helpless behavior in dogs that were classically conditioned to expect an electrical shock after hearing a tone. Later, the dogs were placed in a shuttlebox that contained two chambers separated by a low barrier. The floor was electrified on one side, and not on the other.

		<h3 class="result"><a href="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/09/18/was-aaron-alexis-a-ti/" rel="bookmark">Was Aaron Alexis a&nbsp;TI?</a></h3>					<p>Like <strong>James Holmes</strong> in Aurora, <strong>Aaron Alexis</strong> shot &amp; killed 12 people. Unlike Holmes, but like <strong>Adam Lanza </strong>in Newtown, Alexis was also killed. I guess there will be no interviewing him to get his side of the story. It&#8217;s not like we get to hear anything from Holmes either, though.</p>
<p>He is reported to have complained about hearing voices &amp; feeling vibrations in his body. He was reported to he been on psych meds. He was also reported to have had some violent crimes in his past. I&#8217;m sure there are plenty of facts we are not told, however.</p>
<p>I am a TI, suffering from similar things, but while I may get angry about what is happening to me, I would <em>never</em> pick up a gun &amp; kill anyone. I don&#8217;t own any guns, anyway. When I get angry about what is so cruelly being done to me and other <strong>nonconsensual human experimentees</strong>, I usually get some exercise, read a book, look at something funny, or do some housework. Does that make me any better than these other Targeted Individuals who end up going postal? No, just more in control, thankfully.</p>
<p>Could the psych meds make the difference in whether or not a TI becomes a killer?</p>
<p>Thankfully, I&#8217;m not on psych meds. I stopped taking them when I realized they don&#8217;t work. Which means, in all likelihood, I am not schizophrenic. Chances are Aaron Alexis wasn&#8217;t schizophrenic either, just a targeted individual who &#8220;went postal&#8221;. Kind of sheds a whole new light on the phrase &#8220;<strong>going postal</strong>&#8220;, doesn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>If Aaron Alexis wasn&#8217;t actually suffering from a psychiatric problem, &amp; instead, was being targeted by some one with a malefic purpose, then those people who pushed him into this mess are <em>fully</em> responsible for what happened. I mean, what if he was a <strong>human guinea pig</strong>? What if he had brain implants, ala <strong>Dr. Jose Delgado&#8217;s research </strong>into <strong>brain stimulation</strong>? Will they do an autopsy? If they do, would they release the results? Would the corporate-owned news media ever tell the whole truth to the American public?</p>
<p>That is, unless it is all just another big acting job by the <strong>corporate owned news media</strong>. I mean, if this man was really complaining about hearing voices, was on psych meds, and had a violent criminal history, how was he allowed to be at a Naval facility in D.C.? Something smells fishy regarding this whole situation, as it does in the cases of Adam Lanza &amp; James Holmes.</p>
<p>I think the whole idea of a &#8220;<strong><em>Manchurian Candidate</em></strong>&#8221; is a ruse. I think it is a set up. I think the so-called &#8220;Manchurian Candidate&#8221; is a person who is more likely <strong>framed</strong> for a crime they didn&#8217;t commit. Like Lee Harvey Oswald, for example. At least the public was able to hear that man actually say that he was a patsy. But that was before the media got owned.</p>
<p>If you are a TI&#8230; take care. Don&#8217;t go to the psychiatrists, as they won&#8217;t help you, &amp; it will only allow them to pin some bogus crime on you later. Don&#8217;t lash out at people, since you never know exactly who is behind what is happening to you. Just do your best to survive &amp; see if you can visualize kicking their collective arses in the <strong><em>astral realm</em></strong>.</p>
<p>And remember&#8230; anything you learn from the corporate media is merely the stuff you are <em>allowed</em> to know, &amp; it may or may not be related to the truth.</p>
<p>Peace.</p>

<p>This video shows my implants better than photos do. Searching for an honorable doctor or attorney to help me.</p>
<p>Here is a link showing when this technology first came out:</p>
<p><a href="http://archotol.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1688121">http://archotol.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1688121</a></p>
<p>From this document:</p>
<p>&#8220;The first CI was implanted by William House and John Doyle of Los Angeles, California, in 1961. In 1964, Blair Simmons and Robert White of Stanford University, Stanford, California, placed a 6-channel electrode through the promontory and vestibule directly into the modiolus.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was born &amp; adopted in the late 1960s through a catholic agency. In the last few years, I have seen a number of adoption scandals come out where babies were stolen from the natural parents, who were then told the newborn died, and that the doctor would &#8220;handle it&#8221;, so the mother wouldn&#8217;t have to deal with the emotional trauma of seeing her &#8220;dead child&#8221;&#8230;. the child was then sold&#8230; sometimes to parents, but sometimes, into experimental mind control programs. I am one such child.</p>
<p>I need real legal &amp; medical help. I have been searching for years now, &amp; have not been able to locate anyone close enough to me to help me find out the truth. I would like to have one of these two, RFID-sized implants removed, so I could hopefully find a serial number &amp; track down the manufacturer.</p>

		<h3 class="result"><a href="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/01/07/occulttechno/" rel="bookmark">Occult &amp; Technological Practices Used on&nbsp;TIs</a></h3>					<p>For those of you who see how there is a bigger, occult picture to the plight of <strong>targeted individuals (TI)</strong>, I ask you to read this with an open mind, and please bear with me, as I know I am repeating a few things I have stated in other posts. This post is about the occult and technological practices used on me and other targeted individuals. I will come out with another post soon, God willing, breaking down this stuff, in a list, in separate groups, under a new heading.</p>
<p>After doing some research, due to my own unfortunate situation of being an <strong>unwitting test subject</strong> with actual implants (that anyone can see &amp; feel), I have discovered that this nation has a history of doing <strong>unethical experiments</strong> on unwitting victims. If you were adopted, this may be the case for you.</p>
<p>From Wikipedia:</p>
<p>&#8220;Many of these tests were performed on children, the sick, and mentally disabled individuals, often under the guise of &#8220;medical treatment&#8221;. In many of the studies, a large portion of the subjects were poor, racial minorities, or prisoners.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_experimentation_in_the_United_States">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_experimentation_in_the_United_States</a></p>
<p>I am struck by the numbers of seemingly intelligent people who deny what has been happening to me, even after I show them the implants in my head. Given the placement of these implants (as shown below), I am saddened by my current situation of being a &#8220;<strong>scapegoat</strong>&#8220;.</p>

<p>After doing some research into adoption scandals, it becomes glaringly obvious that I have been used as an experiment for some very evil, disgusting people, &amp; that I was possibly <strong>stolen</strong> from my mother <strong>at birth</strong>, she being told that I was dead, especially when you consider the fact that I was held in custody of this agency for the first six weeks of my life before being placed into an adoptive family, even though my birthmother was supposedly matched up with my adoptive mother long before I was born.</p>
<p><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2011/10/spains-stolen-babies-an-ugly-past-on-a-staggering-scale-2/">http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2011/10/spains-stolen-babies-an-ugly-past-on-a-staggering-scale-2/</a></p>
<p>Although I have tried to contact the agency I was adopted through, I have not yet received a response. Is it that hard for someone to believe that I might have been stolen from my mother at birth, to be used for this hideous program of implantation with <strong>RFID</strong>s &amp; <strong>mind control</strong>?</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_international_adoption_scandals">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_international_adoption_scandals</a></p>
<p>Considering the fact that the system in place, which allows for these experiments to take place, is and always has been heavily involved in <strong>occult</strong> and evil practices, whereby they seem to like to &#8220;<strong>play God</strong>&#8220;, so to speak, how can I keep my mouth shut?</p>
<p>I am now the unfortunate recipient of voices through these implants, which tell me that I am a <strong>ritual sacrifice</strong>, that I was engineered to <a href="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpthoth.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="221" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2012/09/11/symbolism-mind-control-and-metaphysical-sabotage-in-relation-to-archetypal-transference-and-the-second-commandment-of-the-decalogue/12thtrumpthoth-7/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpthoth.jpg" data-orig-size="184,270" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="12thtrumpthoth" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpthoth.jpg?w=184" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpthoth.jpg?w=184" class="alignright size-full wp-image-221" alt="12th Trump from the Thoth Tarot Deck" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpthoth.jpg?w=540" srcset="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpthoth.jpg 184w, https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpthoth.jpg?w=102 102w" sizes="(max-width: 184px) 100vw, 184px"   /></a>born on <strong>12/12</strong> to be that sacrifice, and tell me exactly how my life was ruined through, not only  through the use of these blasted implants (I am trying not to cuss), not only through the use of mind control via tell-a-vision, movies, and mu-sic, but also through the rampant and uncontrolled use of <strong>symbolism</strong> in <strong>astrology</strong> &amp; <strong>tarot</strong>, which are<strong> archetypes</strong> that infect the <strong>collective consciousness</strong>, &amp; the individual&#8217;s <strong>subconscious</strong>, in the form of <strong>memes</strong>. In my case, as seen in the Crowley-Harris Thoth deck&#8217;s 12th trump, I was not only hanging upsidedown from an Egyptian heiroglyph meaning life, but a serpent is attached to my head. I have heard that <strong>Crowley</strong> was an MI6 agent, and a known satanist. Notice that the figure is also unconscious and has hardly any mouth. Could this have something to do with why so many people ignore me? By the way, many of you who know me, know that <strong>mu</strong>=&#8221;12th letter of the greek alphabet&#8221;, and <strong>sic</strong>=&#8221;as intentionally so written&#8221;. Wouldn&#8217;t a person in this metaphysical position have serious issues? It&#8217;s a miracle I didn&#8217;t end up worse than I am. The upsidedown triangle in the lower right of the card indicates that the victim is female. It seems I have been framed.</p>

<p>So, I cannot help but feel as if I am being punished for my actions in this life, which were directly affected by all of the things mentioned above, and therefore, I feel the need to defend myself.</p>
<p>I am now the target for all the things that TIs talk about regarding the torture I experience on a daily basis. I get the pinpricks, the itching, the burning, the constant pain, the gang-stalking, street-theater routine, and I have to watch as bits &amp; pieces of my own story get played out in the various forms of media (tell-a-vision, mu-sic, &amp; movies), as do many victims (I have heard one other TI call this the &#8220;Truman Show Effect&#8221;). This is apparently how victims are farmed for the creative inspiration that naturally results from living in a state of severe but unspeakable <strong>oppression</strong>. They&#8217;ve got this down to a science, folks.</p>
<p>Of course, when I try to put videos out about it, I get the <strong>online harassment</strong> from some very cruel and heartless people who cannot possibly think I am crazy when I only posted about my implants and the history of how RFIDs have been used as early as the 1950s, by people like <strong>Dr. Jose Delgado</strong>, which is a well known fact, &amp; quite easy to research. The fact that I posted a video about my RFIDs &amp; not 15 minutes later, was attacked by at least 20 commenters, lets me know that there are indeed, <strong>disinfo agents</strong> out there, just waiting for the chance to earn a few bucks by attacking a target who is speaking the truth. <strong>Discrediting the victim</strong> is a huge part of their wicked, perverted game.</p>
<p>Here is one other example of how a disinfo agent might work. My youtube user name is the same name I have on this site (<strong>musicis2words</strong>). On youtube, not long after I began to make videos, I saw a user with the moniker, &#8220;ignoramusky&#8221;, as in &#8220;ignore-a-mu-ski&#8221;. Is that a joke? Is he getting paid to do that? Must be quite a cushy job. Or how about the job of those who are tasked with the responsibility of surgically mutilating another individual? How are they able to live with themselves, anyway?</p>
<p>I am sadly reminded of the infamous <strong>Stanley Milgram</strong> experiment where people were willing to administer shocks to others, even to the point of causing heart pain, simply because they were told to.</p>

<p>In the end of it all, I am all too aware of how my <strong>freewill was stolen</strong> from me at birth, and on both physical (implants) and metaphysical (archetypes) levels. Since this is no longer deniable, as I am sure my stalkers are well aware, it becomes very difficult for me to live with the day-to-day degrading and humiliating messages coming from stalkers, both online, in person, and via synthetic telepathy through these implants.</p>
<p>The fact remains that, in my head, at each ear, is <strong>damning evidence</strong> against those who willingly put implants in my head to control my thoughts, emotions, and even my behavior; and in the tarot and astrology is damning evidence that there are indeed occultist elites, running the world, who set individuals like me up, to be made to do things against our will, which makes them directly responsible. I believe this is why I am being tortured. I think they want me dead before I can prove, on a larger scale, what was done to me.</p>
<p>All my life, I felt this absence of higher power, or God. When I was a little girl, I loved <strong>God</strong>, and wanted to serve Him. The bible says that God grantd human beings freewill, but I am saying that humans have taken away a large measure of freewill just through the &#8220;<strong>graven images</strong>&#8221; (images that have become <strong>engraven</strong> into the collective consciousness) of the tarot and astrology, among other things. The bible says that God loves the<strong> truth</strong>, but I have found it increasingly difficult to get anyone to see the truth about what was done to me. What in the world is going on here?</p>
<p>Could I be correct in my attributing the <strong>upsidedown</strong> nature of our world today to the fact that we are living in years surrounding 2012, and the <strong>12th trump</strong> of the tarot is an upsidedown figure in most decks (of which there are over 1,000)? Did those who invented the tarot make that card like that on purpose? Getting it in a reading is supposed to mean &#8220;<strong>redemption through sacrifice</strong>&#8220;, and although my life sure has seemed like one big sacrifice, I have yet to find redemption, in the biblical sense of the term. To me this card is a misuse of what is known as &#8220;<strong>the butterfly effect</strong>&#8220;, whereby a repetion of a vibration increases its amplification.</p>
<p>Okay, so I am ranting now, but everything that I have discovered over the past four and a half years have led me to this point. I so desperately want for the real God, the one who loves each and every one of His creations, to see the truth, and to stop letting me be blamed, and to stop letting me be used, abused, and killed in the process. It&#8217;s no wonder that someone in my position would feel this way. I am accused of all sorts of things that are patently false, as well as some things I am responsible for. However, if I was mind controlled my whole entire life, how can I be blamed? I mean, its not just the archetypal memes, the TV, music, or movies, but it is also <strong>mind control via implants</strong>, which is the most insidious form of mind control I can think of.</p>
<p>It was in 2008 that I discovered the implants, and ever since I have heard audible voices, but for how long was someone &#8220;whispering in my ears&#8221; before I became aware of these things? The idea that a person will not do something under hypnosis that they are not willing to do while conscious has been disproven, so it should be obvious that until I became aware of what was happening, I had been living under a state of <strong>post-hypnotic suggstion</strong>.</p>
<p>For many TIs, life seems like a world where you are the butt of a humungous joke that, until now, everyone has been aware of, but you&#8230; and the joke is, suprise, you&#8217;re being sacrificed! What if this was engineered the whole time that the TI has been living? Would the so-called &#8220;<strong>higher self</strong>&#8221; somehow know this, and have serious issues throughout life because of it?</p>
<p>If you are a TI, I ask you to see if you have the 12 in your <strong>numerology</strong>. It may explain much. Many TIs I have met either have the 12 in their numerology, or they are double digit birthdates.</p>
<p>Another commonality is that many female TIs have some form of the name &#8220;Anne&#8221;, either as a first or middle name. Imagine my suprise on a TI forum, when I saw the moderator&#8217;s email was &#8220;anna-advocate&#8221;, but her group name was &#8220;Jo-Jo-Jive&#8221;. I could just be reading into it, but after what I have been through, I am sensitized to this kind of thing. For example, having initials that spell &#8220;cat&#8221; is used to dehumanize me by my stalkers, but when I looked back on my life and remembered how a woman with the last name &#8220;skinner&#8221; was able to steal and use my ideas, being reminded of the phrase &#8220;skin the cat&#8221;, I am again made to feel like my life is a cruel joke.</p>
<p>It is really just <strong>covert slavery</strong>, which is worse than regular slavery, because the enslaver won&#8217;t even admit that it is happening.</p>
<p>May all TIs find relief from this <strong>heinous crime</strong>.</p>

I have implants in each ear that are the size of RFIDs, photos of which can be found elsewhere in my blog at this wordpress site. I was experimented on without my consent, sold into this sick program through adoption.</p>

<p>If this doesn&#8217;t wake you up to the capabilities of brain implants, and the fact that they had these capabilities back in the 1950s, then nothing will, and you should go back to sleep.</p>
<p>Dr. Delgado was financed by the Office of Naval Research.</p>

I have been the unwitting victim of mind control experimentation. In the right hands, this technology can do wonders, but in the wrong hands, they can turn the life of a human being into a virtual hell.</p>
<p>I pray every day. The bible says that God loves the truth, and so I post my documents &amp; videos in the hopes that he will see the truth of what was done to me by the serpent class, &amp; how they did it to me. It truly is sick, what they&#8217;ve been doing&#8230; it&#8217;s technological, metaphysical sorcery.</p>
