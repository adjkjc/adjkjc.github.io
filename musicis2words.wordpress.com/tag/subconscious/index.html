<p>This article is a revision of a previous article called, &#8220;<strong>Mind Control Using Symbolism in Words and Numbers&#8221;</strong>. The original article is linked below.</p>
<p><em>Symbolism</em> works on both visual &amp; phonetic levels, on a <em>subconscious</em> level, to affect the <em>psyche </em>(a word derived from Greek &amp; Latin words that refer to the spirit), which is why it works so well, and also why so many people don&#8217;t see it happening. One might even recognize language as a type of <em>spell</em>, no pun intended.</p>
<p><em>They cannot see the forest for the trees. </em></p>
<p>Or perhaps, those who cannot see it are still somewhat <em>unconscious</em>.</p>
<p>Whatever the case may be, <em>language</em> is one of the first things an infant begins to learn in an effort to communicate. It is visual &amp; phonetically perceived, once a person begins to learn to write. Texting has allowed for people to see more clearly the symbolism inherent in our language.</p>
<p>There are many methods of <em>mind control</em> that have been uncovered. As most of you know, there is <em>symbolism</em> and <em>subliminals</em> used in movies, music, and television; there are also high tech forms of mind control, using <em>implants</em> (nano or otherwise) and other technologies; there is mind control involving the use of <em>trauma</em> to mess with the human being’s psychology; there is a form of mind control that uses popular archetypes to remove freewill to a large degree; and then there is the manipulation of language. While the technology I have researched seems to be completely plausible, I am taking a look at language (specifically, the English Language, which is to a great degree, credited to Sir Francis Bacon) in this article, because it has been around much longer than the technology currently in use has been, and has a wider scope of impact.</p>
<p><em>Language</em>, including words, names, phrases, and slang, seems to contain a disproportionate amount of <em>negative symbolism</em> (considering many root words), and it can even sometimes be confusing, albeit on a level that is hard to discern. This creates a subconscious and subtle base layer of confusion which then sets the stage for general mind control using other technologies, like movies, music, and television, for example.</p>
<p>Because symbolism bypasses the conscious mind and goes straight into the <em>subconscious</em>, it is a type of programming, especially when used in language, which is learned during the most impressionable years of a child’s life.</p>
<p><b>Here are some words &amp; numbers that should be looked at symbolically, given the way symbolism affects the human psyche (Remember, these examples of <strong>symbolism in language</strong> can be <strong>visual</strong> and/or <strong>phonetic</strong>): </b></p>
<p>As I&#8217;ve noted in other documents, the word &#8220;<strong><em>psyche</em></strong>&#8221; is derived from Latin and Greek words denoting the <em>spirit</em>, which speaks volumes in itself. So <em>psychology</em>, then, is really the study of the spirit.</p>
<p><strong>Sacred</strong>: the sacral chakra was originally described as red.</p>
<p><strong>Century and Millennia</strong>: “cent” means 100, thus a century = 100 years. “Mill” refers to 1000,000, but a millennia = 1000 years (not a million years). Like the way certain months are not in line with their numbering, I contend that things like this can throw the<strong> psyche</strong> out of balance, in a subconscious way, thus making it easier for a person to be programmed by the above mentioned technologies.</p>
<p><strong>Therapist</strong> = “the rapist”, which I had picked up many years ago, from a movie called, “Girl Interrupted” (Angelina Jolie’s character says it).</p>
<p>Ever noticed how many names have the word “<strong>war</strong>” in them? Warburg, Warner, Warren (as in the Warren Commission), are a few. By the way, “war” is not exactly fair, is it, yet there is a term out there known as “warfare”… does this word, because of the way it sounds symbolically, make it so that more people accept war happening in our world?</p>
<p>Which brings us to the expression, “all’s fair in love and war”, but it isn’t true. However, does the prevalence of that expression in our world, subconsciously make people accept things that occur in love and war?</p>
<p><strong>Root Words</strong>: Consider how many words and names have root words like “ill”, “ow”, “mar”, “mal” or “ick” in them. Examples are Bill, Bow, Mark, Malcolm, and Trick, respectively. What about &#8220;lack&#8221;, as in black &amp; slack?</p>
<p><strong>Left vs. Right</strong>:</p>
<p>Okay, so the word “right” usually refers to the following in the English language: a direction, right handed, correct, the conservative party… phonetically, there is also rite, as in a ritual; or write; or also right as in &#8220;human rights&#8221;, while….</p>
<p>The word “left” traditionally refers to: a direction, left as in the “liberal party”, and left as in “gone”. By the way, left-handedness is often called “south paw”… is there any symbolism there? If right means “correct”, does left symbolically mean “wrong”? Question: What happens if a person is naturally left-handed, but made to be right-handed? I ask this with the knowledge that a stroke in the left hemisphere of the brain has effects on the right side of the body &amp; vice versa. Is this how the whole left-handers are right brained, and right-handers are left brained concept was developed? If someone who is left-handed is made to be right-handed, would it take them out of their right mind, symbolically, metaphorically, metaphysically, spiritually? Some illustrious scientist ought to do a study on the effects of forcing a left-hander to be right-handed, instead of experimenting with brain implants on children from compromised groups (like adoptees). Back in the day, left handedness was considered a sign of being a witch, and meant that a person was “evil”…</p>
<p>This brings me to the word “<strong>evil</strong>”… Is Eve ill?</p>
<p>While we’re on the biblical: what about “<strong>Cain &amp; Abel</strong>”? Abel=able (as in “able-bodied”) Cain=cane (as in a tool to help a person walk)… could Cain have been disabled??? Dis Abel (dis-as in disrespect). Is this some kind of a joke? Did Cain really kill Abel? Judging by their names, it seems to me that Cain was disabled. I hope you don’t think I am blaspheming here, because I am simply searching for the truth.</p>
<p>How about <strong>Noah</strong>? No &#8211; ah??? As in &#8220;<em>no relief</em>&#8220;? Why was he one of God&#8217;s most favored in the bible? Because he got no relief? I mean&#8230; I wonder about this.</p>
<p><strong>Graven</strong> = as past participle of &#8220;grave&#8221;, meaning &#8220;fraught with danger or harm&#8221;.</p>
<p>So are graven images merely images that are fraught with danger or harm? When I look at certain trump cards of the tarot, like the Tower, the Hanged Man, and Death, for example, this seems to be the case. It also seems to be the case in the use and near worship of the crucifix that so many people are fond of. Please see my document: <a href="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2012/09/11/symbolism-mind-control-and-metaphysical-sabotage-in-relation-to-archetypal-transference-and-the-second-commandment-of-the-decalogue" rel="nofollow">https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2012/09/11/symbolism-mind-control-and-metaphysical-sabotage-in-relation-to-archetypal-transference-and-the-second-commandment-of-the-decalogue</a></p>
<p>Or&#8230; what if <strong>graven images</strong> are those that have, over time, become<strong> engraven</strong> into the collective unconscious?</p>
<p><strong>Justice</strong> = &#8220;just us&#8221; (from Jordan Maxwell), but how about “just-ice”?</p>
<p>Why is justice blind anyway? Some people say that this phrase relates the idea that justice is impartial. Well, why not just say “justice is impartial”? I need her to be sighted and to see the whole truth, because I feel like I am being judged for actions or behaviors taken out of context. Why can I not get justice for the horrible things that have been done to me ever since I was taken from my mother at birth, if the United States is supposed to be about “liberty and justice for all”? Alas, the ideal of “justice” has simply become yet another simulacrum in our modern world, only to be found in a clothing line these days.</p>
<p><strong>Lettuce</strong>: &#8220;Let us&#8221; (let who?)</p>
<p><strong>Black</strong>: &#8220;Be Lack&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Week</strong>: &#8220;weak&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Father</strong>: &#8220;Fat Her&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Mother</strong>: &#8220;M Other&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Government</strong> = govern= to control and ment=mind =&#8221;control of the mind&#8221; (from Michael Tsarion)</p>
<p><strong>Horus</strong> = “Whore us” (us or U.S.?)</p>
<p><strong>Hermes</strong> = “her-me’s”</p>
<p><strong>Masons</strong> = “Ma-sons”</p>
<p><strong>Masturbate</strong> = “master”, as in ruler, and “bait” as in what you use to go fishing.</p>
<p><strong>Peace</strong> = piece=a gun or (piece of?) = peas</p>
<p><strong>Nazi</strong> = “Not see” or “Not C”</p>
<p><strong>Frequency</strong> = Freak when c or Free Quincy?</p>
<p><strong>Alphabet</strong> = alpha (male) bet (wager)</p>
<p><strong>DISC</strong>= “dis” “c” (as in disrespect)</p>
<p><strong>Curfew</strong> = &#8220;cure few&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Culture</strong>= &#8220;cult&#8221;ure = as in a cult, or as in a petri dish</p>
<p><strong>Television</strong>= &#8220;tell-a-vision&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Metaphor</strong> = &#8220;meta&#8221; (above, beyond, before, or about); phor= &#8220;four&#8221; (4th trump of tarot is the Emperor card), so metaphor seems to favor the rulers of this world.</p>
<p><strong>History</strong> = “his story” and Hebrews = “He brews” are easy examples of the misogynistic nature of our world.</p>
<p>Women are said to age less gracefully than men. Could the word &#8220;<strong>heritage</strong>&#8221; have something to do with that?</p>
<p><strong>9 </strong>= Nine = &#8220;nein&#8221; = &#8220;no&#8221;(from Michael Tsarion)</p>
<p><strong>11 </strong>= Eleven = El (a name of God, as in “elohim”) even (equal) eleven = 11th trump of various tarot decks (research them: in most, it means &#8220;justice&#8221;, or “strength”, while in one deck, it means &#8220;lust&#8221;). 11th sphere of cabala is supposed to represent &#8220;knowledge&#8221;, but it is often missing from the cabbalistic tree. So does 9/11 equate to &#8220;no justice&#8221;, “no strength, or &#8220;no knowledge&#8221;???? Did all those people die as blood sacrifices to empower some desire for no justice, strength, or knowledge??</p>
<p><strong>12 </strong>= tw elve as in elves.</p>
<p>Most people recognize that <strong>Santa</strong> is an anagram of satan</p>
<p>Regarding <strong>numbers</strong>, would it not throw a young psyche off balance to learn the word “oct” (as in “octagon”) means “eight”, yet October is the 10<sup>th</sup> month? How about “sept” meaning seven, even though September is the 9<sup>th</sup> month? And don’t forget November and December. “Nov” means 9, and “Dec” refers to 10 (see: “Decade”). I have heard one person say that they had added on a few months in the names of Augustus and Julius Ceasar, but that is no reason to name the last four months out of sync with the way they are numbered. Also, a natural calendar would have 13 months of 28 days each, since the word “month” refers to “moon”.</p>
<p><strong>Music </strong>= <em>mu</em> (12th letter of greek alphabet) &amp; <em>sic</em> (&#8220;as intentionally so written&#8221;), and also “muse sick”. So this word, <em>sic</em>, could be symbolically felt as “12, as in intentionally so written”. As someone with a 12/12 birthdate, I cannot help but feel I have been programmed.</p>
<p>I have heard some people say &#8220;Obama nation&#8221;&#8230;  it sounds like they’re saying &#8220;<strong>abomination</strong>” or “Oh bomb a nation”.</p>
<p>So when I hear people speak about <em>freewill</em>, I beg to differ if a portion of us are affected by these negative and/or confusing things in our language. It seems to me that more often than not, people are reacting to situations or circumstances set up long before we were ever born. This kind of destroys the concept of <em>freewill</em> for me. Especially when I consider how my adoptive mother named me with the initials, “C.A.T.”, and didn&#8217;t even like cats. Could that have had something to do with the way I was mistreated and neglected when I was growing up? Then, as an up and coming art student, I met a fellow student with the last name of &#8220;Skinner&#8221;, who was able to somehow steal many of ideas and ended up ruining my career and my life. The phrase, &#8220;How many ways can you skin the cat&#8221; comes to mind. Again, I ask, is this some kind of a joke?</p>
<p>Also, I have heard it said, many times, that animals are more sensitive than people. Could this have something to do with why I had such a hard time dealing with being bullied and neglected by my adoptive parents? They would often tell me I was too sensitive. Could my being “extra sensitive” have something to do with the <em>self-fulfilling prophecy</em> of my mother calling me stupid, and saying that I would never amount to anything?</p>
<p>For those of you who think I am being blasphemous, I ask you to remember that the Bible states that God loves the truth, which is all I am trying to find and talk about. I am sadly reminded of the song, “Blasphemous Rumors”, by Depeche Mode, where they sing, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to start any blasphemous rumors, but I think that God has a sick sense of humor, and when I die, I expect to find him laughing&#8221;. Doesn’t the bible also say that the Truth shall set you free”? I sure hope so. I sure hope that God can see how all my life seems like it has been orchestrated and lived as a reaction to a negative programming (including much more than just the language), over which I had no control.</p>

<p><b>The Use of Color in Mind Control Conditioning to Divide &amp; Conquer<br />
</b></p>
<p><i>Mind Control</i>, while ubiquitous &amp; pervasive in modern society, is acting on a level unseen by many people who argue vehemently that it does not exist. It becomes a sort of “can’t see the forest for the trees” issue. Perhaps they are not <i>consciously</i> aware of its effects on their <em>psyche</em>, if they are truly conscious at all (a topic for another article).</p>
<p>As I have noted in previous articles, <i>psyche</i> is a Greek word meaning <i>spirit</i>, incidentally. Mind Control indeed affects the <em>spirit</em>, which is evident in part, in the fact that so many people are on <em>psych meds</em> for one reason or another, &amp; that there is no definitive objective test for most of the psychiatric ailments in the DSM (another topic for another article). This article specifically deals with the use of color in mind control conditioning.</p>

For example, fast food restaurants usually use the colors red, orange, &amp; <em>yellow</em> on their street signs. Take McDonalds &amp; Burger King for example. Do you know why they chose these colors?</p>
<p>Research into the subject of color used in fast food advertising would yield a variety of results. However, what I have discovered is that, predominantly, red is associated with a sense of urgency, yellow with hunger, &amp; orange with impulse buying. <img data-attachment-id="1209" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/09/29/the-use-of-color-in-mind-control-conditioning-to-divide-conquer/checkerboard/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/checkerboard.jpg" data-orig-size="160,160" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="checkerboard" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/checkerboard.jpg?w=160" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/checkerboard.jpg?w=160" class="wp-image-1209 alignleft" alt="checkerboard" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/checkerboard.jpg?w=112&#038;h=112" width="112" height="112" srcset="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/checkerboard.jpg?w=112&amp;h=112 112w, https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/checkerboard.jpg?w=150&amp;h=150 150w, https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/checkerboard.jpg 160w" sizes="(max-width: 112px) 100vw, 112px" /></p>
<p>Of course, black &amp; white are really obvious regarding the &#8220;<em>divide &amp; conquer</em>&#8221; method used in conditioning. Get one set of people to identify with the color white, the other to identify with black, then you have a bit of instant mind control, due to the commonly accepted symbolic meanings of those colors. In reality, most people in the world are different shades of brown.</p>
<p><img data-attachment-id="1210" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/09/29/the-use-of-color-in-mind-control-conditioning-to-divide-conquer/brideandgroom2/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/brideandgroom2.jpg" data-orig-size="136,160" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="brideandgroom2" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/brideandgroom2.jpg?w=136" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/brideandgroom2.jpg?w=136" class="alignright size-full wp-image-1210" alt="brideandgroom2" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/brideandgroom2.jpg?w=540"   />White is thought of as representing purity, which is why white is traditionally worn by the bride in weddings, but then why does the groom traditionally wear black, I wonder? White is also usually ascribed more positive qualities while black is often associated with the negative, especially when paired together. The term &#8220;black &amp; white&#8221; often refers to a lack of detail, as in &#8220;it&#8217;s not all black &amp; white&#8221;. Black is often associated with darkness &amp; evil, hence the term &#8220;<em>black magic</em>&#8221; &amp; it connotations.</p>
<p>Red is known to be stimulating, while blue is usually calming. This can also be applied to warm &amp; cool colors in general, but red &amp; blue are the quintessential warm &amp; cool colors, so I suspect that they would have the strongest effect in those areas, respectively.</p>
<p>That which divides in order control has been doing it for millennia. It sorts male &amp; female into radically different colors to divide them from each other. If you’re a baby boy, then you will most likely spend babyhood &amp; childhood in a room full of blue, &amp; if a girl, you get pink. What does being surrounded by a specific color through early childhood do to the child&#8217;s psyche?</p>

Exposing students to the color red prior to an exam has been shown to have a negative impact on test performance. Could it be that red overstimulates the mind, making it difficult to focus? If a baby girl is surrounded by pink from babyhood into the tweens, could inhibit her ability to learn &amp; retain information?</p>
<p>Some may say &#8220;girls get pink not red&#8221; to confuses the issue. Pink is light red as &#8220;baby blue&#8221; is light blue.</p>
<p>Why IS there a &#8220;battle of the sexes&#8221; anyway? Why is it that men &amp; women are so radically different? Why are women often considered neurotic, catty, &amp; high maintenance? Could it have anything to do with the effects of color on the psyche, at least in part? Of course there are other contributing factors (like conditioning through movies, dolls, television ads), but the use of color as assigned to gender is the first form of conditioning with color, that affects the newborn baby, which will then be built upon, as that child grows up.</p>
<p>The pink/blue thing is a <i>societal construct</i> used for control. When a new baby is on the way, everyone wants to know what gender it is so they can buy the appropriate gift for the shower. <i>Conditioning</i> begins before the baby is even born.<img data-attachment-id="1205" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/09/29/the-use-of-color-in-mind-control-conditioning-to-divide-conquer/babyboysroom/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/babyboysroom.jpg" data-orig-size="160,120" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="babyboysroom" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/babyboysroom.jpg?w=160" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/babyboysroom.jpg?w=160" class="alignright size-full wp-image-1205" alt="babyboysroom" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/babyboysroom.jpg?w=540" srcset="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/babyboysroom.jpg 160w, https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/babyboysroom.jpg?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 160px) 100vw, 160px"   /></p>
<p>If the unborn child is to be a girl, the baby shower will have a predominance of the color pink: pink decorations, pink plates &amp; cups, pink gifts. By the same token, if the baby is going to be a boy, the shower will be all blue. Given the different effects of color on the psyche, can you imagine what it is like o spend the first few years of your life in an all-pink room, versus an all-blue room?</p>
<p>This marks the very beginning of how <em>psychology</em> (the study of the psyche/spirit) will be used on people, to <em>divide &amp; conquer</em>. By making women &amp; men so radically opposed to each other in the assignment of color based on gender, males &amp; females are then more easily divided by needs &amp; interests later on. The more you divide people from one another, the more they are likely to feel alone (at least subconsciously), &amp; the easier it is to control them using the myriad of methods out there, including education, music, television, movies, and more.</p>
<p>If the heads of a family unit (mother &amp; father) are divided, even if only subconsciously, then there will be arguments that might not otherwise occur if people were on an even playing field. This breeds easier control on the children, who will sense the disparity between the parents.</p>

They are not next to each other either. A similar situation exists in assigning symbols to people based on gender. They are not exactly opposite (complimentary), nor are they very similar. <em>In the case of colors, the dividing is symbolic &amp; the radically different colors affect the psyche differently</em>. In the case of the commonly accepted symbols for male &amp; female, the dividing happens through a process known as <img data-attachment-id="1203" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/09/29/the-use-of-color-in-mind-control-conditioning-to-divide-conquer/malefemalesymbols/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/malefemalesymbols.jpg" data-orig-size="160,160" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="MaleFemaleSymbols" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/malefemalesymbols.jpg?w=160" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/malefemalesymbols.jpg?w=160" class="size-full wp-image-1203 alignright" alt="MaleFemaleSymbols" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/malefemalesymbols.jpg?w=540" srcset="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/malefemalesymbols.jpg 160w, https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/malefemalesymbols.jpg?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 160px) 100vw, 160px"   />“<em>Archetypal Transference</em>”, &amp; is still unseen by those who are not fully conscious.</p>
<p>Once you can see how colors affect the psyche, &amp; how different colors are assigned to people based on gender, the question then becomes: How long have males been blue and females been pink, &amp; who decided that these colors should be assigned to human beings at birth?</p>
<p>Whether an accident or with intent, the dividing of people with color still has deleterious effects on the collective psyche of the general population, albeit on a subconscious level. This is why it is so hard to see the effects of it.</p>

Some say aliens are responsible. Some people say it is demonic in nature &amp; accepting Jesus Christ as your personal savior is the only way to find relief. Some say this phenomena is &#8220;<strong>cause stalking</strong>&#8221; by a group of people who have <strong>judged</strong> the victim<strong> in absentia</strong>. Even still, there are those people, like some bloggers, who say it is something like &#8220;a godlike entity manipulating humanity&#8221;. I even read where one blogger overheard his handlers referring to him as &#8220;<strong>the sacrifice</strong>&#8220;.</p>
<p>As a victim of this, it becomes very difficult to know what the actual truth is. I am harassed with voices, directed conversation, pain, some sort of radiation hits in the chest, crotch, head, to the point where I honestly don&#8217;t understand what is happening. I am not alone in this, as I have read &amp; seen many other victims of this horrendous crime speak out about the exact same things. One begins to wonder if God is really a cruel entity allowing these things to go on, or worse, causing them, which is something I really <em>don&#8217;t want</em> to believe. If I am wrong about this, then I beg forgiveness, but I am confused about this issue.</p>

In my case, however, the very visible &amp; obvious <strong>implants</strong> in my ears make it all to clear that someone has been controlling me throughout my life. Since it is well-known that <strong>Dr. Jose Delgado</strong> was doing his research into <strong>brain stimulation</strong> with implants back in the 1950s &amp; for at least 20 years, it is not hard to imagine that I might&#8217;ve been sold into this &#8220;<strong>program</strong>&#8221; as a baby, through adoption. I have noticed that there is a predominance of adoptees &amp; foster kids who are victims, who blog &amp; vlog about this horrible situation. This is telling.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m so sorry for those who are suffering through this. <em>No one deserves it</em>, especially when you consider the overarching problem at the root of all of this. The problem that I see is that mind control has been happening on some level, for centuries at least. Mind control, by definition, <em>removes</em> freewill, &amp; there are many ways in which mind control is used to subtly influence people. The <strong>flicker rate</strong> of tv &amp; movies alone is enough to hypnotize people, especially children. Any <strong>subliminal messages</strong> in movies or television, such as hidden <strong>symbolism</strong>, access the <strong>subconscious mind</strong> directly, especially while people are in a <strong>trance</strong>. It is the manipulation of the human mind, which again, removes freewill.</p>
<p>It does seem that <strong>trauma</strong> plays a role in how much of an impact mind control has on an individual. It is now professionally recognized that adoption is a trauma for the baby, so it stands to reason that being placed in foster care, or any separation of a child from it&#8217;s natural parents would then also be traumatic. What about other traumas that occur in infancy &amp; early childhood? Like the near drowning at 3 years old, cited by so many ritual abuse victims? How about circumcision at birth? What about the onslaught of tests, immunizations, goo in the eyes, separation from mother, endured by most newborns born in hospitals? Could it be that these early traumas have a purpose beyond what is stated regarding the reasons for what is cited above?</p>

I say this because I know that I am constantly blamed for things in my past, even though it is clear that <em>I never truly had freewill</em> in my life, do to the many ways in which I was affected by mind control.</p>
<p><strong>I have observed multiple ways a &#8220;system&#8221; can exert mind control over it&#8217;s population:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1) Religion</strong>&#8211; Religion has a long history of being used to control the masses. Children are brought up in a religion &amp; know nothing else. Most of these religions are pagan in origin, but vehemently deny that fact, &amp; then carry on with obvious pagan traditions. This would naturally cause a conflict in a child&#8217;s mind. The bible warns that &#8220;Christians would be persecuted in the so-called &#8220;end times&#8221;. Is it a coincidence that I know a fellow TI who&#8217;s name is &#8220;Christian&#8221;? I doubt it.</p>
<p><strong>2) Education</strong>&#8211; The educational system in the US especially, has a specific slanted point of view. If a child does not internalize this point of view, they end up with poor grades &amp; labeled as losers.</p>
<p><strong>3) Parenting</strong>&#8211; Parents have a specific point of view &amp; want their children at least to understand it, but some parents enforce their point of view on their children. But worse than this is the fact that some parents simply leave their kids alone most of the time, only giving negative attention to them. This is a form of <em>negative programming</em>.</p>
<p><strong>4) Media (TV, movies, music, talk radio, etc.)-</strong> Growing up with the mass media, I can attest to the fact that it shaped my beliefs, especially since I had negative programming from my own parents, &amp; was mostly left alone by them. Television was my primary baby sitter. There are subliminals in movies &amp; television to be sure, but also in music. Some messages are in the form of cleverly hidden artwork or backwards masking, but others can be found in the themes, which get repeated over &amp; over in multiple movies &amp; stories viewed by adults &amp; children alike. As I&#8217;ve seen others point out, there is a reason why they call it &#8220;television programming&#8221;. There are those who will vehemently deny that subliminal programming exists, even when it is right in your face (see <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmMnnOr-lYQ"><br /> Subliminal Sex Messages and Pornography in Advertising and Cartoons </a>). However, the flicker rate of television &amp; movies alone is enough to put people in a trance, especially when in front of the big-screen. Ever notice how large tv screens are these days? And why all that push for people to get HDTV even to the point of giving away free converters to people? Ever since that happened, it sure seems like things changed really quickly. It is like Orwell&#8217;s <strong>1984</strong>, just a little bit different.</p>
<p><strong>5) Language</strong>&#8211; If you take a good, hard look at the English language, you will find negative root words in many other words &amp; proper names. I have a video on this, called <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMe5Y4Hs_7c">&#8220;Mind Control Using Symbolism in Language and Numbers&#8221;</a>. A couple of examples though: how many words can you find with the root words mar, war, ill, or ow in them? This attests to how society, which learns language very young, is controlled by a very negative base program. There is this symbolism inherent in our language, some of it is visual (reading), while some of it is phonetic (hearing). You might consider your own name &amp; how you might&#8217;ve been treated by others throughout your life based on it.</p>
<p><strong>6) Controlled Opposition Groups</strong>&#8211; These are groups formed with the specific intent of controlling any opposition to the &#8220;system&#8221; (i.e. cult-ure or society). They are often, but not exclusively, from other countries, coming over to the US to alert people to the existence of mind control. Then, when people begin to wake up, they are targeted by the system that wants to defend its existence. They use mind control techniques such as NLP (neuro-linguistic programming) to give them a powerful influence on people.</p>
<p><strong>7)</strong> <strong>Occult Practices</strong>&#8211; Mind Control has been going on at least since the Pharos in Egypt, but more likely, it goes back to the Druids. They&#8217;ve been using drugs &amp; hypnotism for centuries, possibly much longer, and believe it or not, black magic &amp; voodoo are also involved. They are pushing forth an intent to influence individuals &amp; society as a whole, using <strong>meta-physical technologies</strong>, the knowledge of which has been passed down through their generations, the result of which has effects on the spirit of a person. Psyche comes from a Greek word referring to the spirit. Knowing the psychology of human beings allows for a greater influence over them.</p>
<p><strong>8)</strong> <strong>Implants &amp; Other Physical Technologies</strong>&#8211; When I consider the work of Nazi scientists &amp; the fact that the US brought them to this country under &#8220;<strong>Project Paperclip</strong>&#8221; to continue their experiments, it becomes extremely difficult for me to ignore the possibility that people are actually sold into programs of mind control experimentation, sometimes by their own parents. Technologies such as brain implants (see Dr. Jose Delgado&#8217;s work in the 1950s &amp; 60s), are used to completely wreck a person&#8217;s life or to enhance it.</p>
<p>The positive implications for mind control make it absolutely disgusting that they are using it to influence so many people in such negative ways. I mean, they could use it to help people quit smoking, for example, or to make people more successful &amp; therefore allow them to make better contributions to the world. So, why wouldn&#8217;t they?</p>
<p>It is my theory that those who are responsible for the most intense aspects of mind control, such as implants, do actually use<img data-attachment-id="924" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/07/04/mind-control-and-the-targeted-individual/goldendawn/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/goldendawn.jpg" data-orig-size="200,282" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="goldendawn" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/goldendawn.jpg?w=200" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/goldendawn.jpg?w=200" class="alignright  wp-image-924" alt="goldendawn" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/goldendawn.jpg?w=128&#038;h=181" width="128" height="181" srcset="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/goldendawn.jpg?w=128&amp;h=181 128w, https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/goldendawn.jpg?w=106&amp;h=150 106w, https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/goldendawn.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 128px) 100vw, 128px" /> it for positive purposes, but only on pre-designated people (i.e. the ones they can control the most), while for others (the ones they deem as the &#8220;losers&#8221;), it is used to keep that class of people down. It seems that they are keeping a balance by doing this: one group is brought to new heights, while the other is brought to extreme lows.</p>

The hexagram is prominently displayed in the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, &amp; it is also used in Theosophy. Both of these organizations, among others, are so-called &#8220;Secret Societies&#8221;, who, like the Freemasons, allow only those at the very top of the hierarchy to know the full truth of their methods &amp; practices, and what their role is in society at large. The hexagram is only one example of a <em>meta-physical technology</em>.</p>
<p>Those who are TIs are suffering as a result of being put at the pinnacle of an upside-down triangle, while their &#8220;chosen ones&#8221; are placed at the top.</p>
<p>It is also my theory that the ones who are held down, throughout their lives are then used for the creative inspiration that naturally comes from this sort of <strong>oppression</strong>. This inspiration gleaned from victims ultimately shows up in TV, movies, &amp; music, which means that there is a whole class of people benefitting from another class&#8217; suffering. It is an unspoken, unacknowledged form of <strong>slavery</strong> that can only result in emotional issues for the <strong>unwitting victims</strong>. These issues would then cause the victim to act out in a variety of ways, throughout their lives, since on some subconscious level, they probably know that they have been <strong>covertly enslaved</strong>.</p>
<p>This makes the <strong>TI</strong> the ultimate <strong>muse</strong> for an elitist system that sees people as mere &#8220;<strong>human resources</strong>&#8221; to be &#8220;utilized&#8221;. Trying to get any compensation or justice for what has been done to them, simply makes them look &#8220;crazy&#8221; or schizophrenic to those who don&#8217;t understand such a thing. However, part of me wonders if maybe everyone around the victim is well <img data-attachment-id="755" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/01/28/mcusingarchetypaltransference/justiceblind/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/justiceblind.jpg" data-orig-size="106,160" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="justiceblind" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/justiceblind.jpg?w=106" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/justiceblind.jpg?w=106" class="alignright size-full wp-image-755" alt="justiceblind" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/justiceblind.jpg?w=540"   />aware of the nightmare going on in front of their faces &amp; simply refuse to acknowledge it, lest the victim have a foothold into getting any justice for what has been done. There is a reason why &#8220;<strong>justice is blind</strong>&#8221; is a well-known phrase in this world, &amp; it has absolutely nothing to do with impartiality.</p>
<p>I am pretty sure that the idea of justice is now nothing more than a simulacrum of the original concept.</p>
<p>In my own situation, it seems that my whole life has been orchestrated, unbeknownst to me until more recently. I only just began to wake up to the situation in 2008, which is, coincidentally, the same year that I discovered I had implants in each ear. Symbolically &amp; psychologically, my life seems to have been completely manipulated to make me negative, sad, confused, depressed, &amp; apathetic. I have even seen how some of the more &#8220;metaphysical&#8221; technologies affected my adoptive mother&#8217;s life.</p>
<p>Some people would call what is happening to Targeted Individuals an affliction, but I would call it an <em>infliction</em> because it is inflicted on us by some other entity or entities.</p>
<p>When you present obvious evidence &amp; people don&#8217;t believe you, it can be extremely frustrating. Many of the same people who admit that the powers that be are using symbolism to manipulate human beings, will then deny the possibility that a person has been manipulated in this way. Many people who admit that there is all sorts of technology being used against people will then deny that implants exist, even though Dr. Delgado&#8217;s work in brain stimulation is well-known. This seems to be by design &amp; with the intent of driving the victim mad.</p>
<p>This will result in further discrediting the victim, who has most likely already had a smear campaign done against them. Those involved in these kinds of <strong>psyops</strong> (psychological operations), with the intent of destroying the victim&#8217;s life, credibility, sanity, and health, really deserve to be cursed to live the life they are consigning victims to.</p>

<p>Psychiatrist Carl Gustave Jung described the <strong>archetypes</strong> as models of people, behaviors, or personalities that exist in the collective unconscious. <strong>Transference</strong> is the projection of unconscious contents.</p>
<p>It is often said that <strong>a child&#8217;s mind is like a sponge</strong>.</p>
<p>It is my argument that these movies program females into the embodying the negative female stereotypes, such as: being catty, high maintenance princess-types who generally dislike or distrust their mothers. This is all <strong>subconscious</strong>, of course, &amp; most females will not admit to this being an issue.</p>
<p>As you can see, these stories have been around much longer than the Disney films in some form or another. This is how I feel many of these roles became archetypes in the first place. However, Disney in particular, seemed to have some interest in making the adult female role the antihero. Here are some of the Disney Princess movies that contain the archetypes of “princess”, “hero/prince”, and “evil queen”, and where they came from (skip past these, if you are already familiar with the background info):</p>
<p><strong>Rapunzel</strong>, a tale with similarities to a Persian tale from the 10th century AD called “Rudaba”, was published by the Brothers Grimm in 1812, which then became the basis for the Disney movie “Tangled”.<br />
<strong>The Little Mermaid</strong>, published in 1837 by Hans Christian Anderson, became the Disney animated film of the same name in 1989.<br />
<strong>Sleeping Beauty</strong>, taken from an original story called, “The Beauty sleeping in the wood”, by Charles Perrault, published in 1697, was made into the Disney animated film, 1959.<br />
<strong>Snow White</strong>, taken from an original story by the Brothers Grimm, in 1812, but completed in 1857, was made into the animated Disney film in 1937.<br />
<strong>Cinderella</strong>, taken from an original story by Charles Perrault, published in 1697, was later published by the Brothers Grimm in 1812, and made into a Disney animated film in 1950. However, there are earlier versions of this theme, in fables complete with slipper motif, going as far back as the 1st century BCE.</p>
<p><strong>The Set Up:</strong></p>
<p><em>Cinderella</em> was originally a story about unjust oppression with a reward at the end, and is possibly derived from an original Greek tale called <em>Rhodopis</em>, which contains no evil queen or wicked stepmother. The first version I could find with a wicked stepmother in it is a Chinese tale from 860 AD, called <em>Ye Xian</em> (Yeh Shen). The Disney movie Cinderella has the female antihero in its version, as does <em>Snow White</em>, <em>Sleeping Beauty</em>, <em>The Little Mermaid</em>, and <em>Tangled</em> (taken from <em>Rapunzel</em>). It is my opinion that these particular Disney movies actually serve to disempower women in general, although some of them do show assertive princesses. The repetition of the theme of the oppressed princess (daughter role), trapped by some rendition of the evil queen (mother role), but who ultimately gets rescued by a dashing prince (hero/lover role) does a gross disservice to women in general. By creating a set of unnatural archetypes based on roles from these stories, these roles subconsciously become projected onto people by the little girl (or adult woman who grew up with these stories).</p>
<p>Today’s little girl is more prone to the programming behind these movies, since they are inundated with the movies, DVDs, books, video <a href="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/princesscanopybed.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="872" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/02/25/archetypaltransferencedisneyprincessmovies/princesscanopybed/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/princesscanopybed.jpg" data-orig-size="160,143" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="PrincessCanopyBed" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/princesscanopybed.jpg?w=160" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/princesscanopybed.jpg?w=160" class="alignright size-full wp-image-872" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/princesscanopybed.jpg?w=540" alt="PrincessCanopyBed" srcset="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/princesscanopybed.jpg 160w, https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/princesscanopybed.jpg?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 160px) 100vw, 160px"   /></a>games, baby dolls, Barbie dolls, coloring books, figurines, room décor, outfits, etc., which all serve to reinforce the “princess” role in the child’s mind, before she has any defenses against such programming. By being exposed to these movies, over and over again (because of the advent of DVDs), and at such a young age (sometimes from birth), this programming is even harder to resist. It is often said that a child’s mind is like a sponge. Since the programming comes through on a subconscious level, the child’s open mind has no filtering mechanism to avoid being programmed. I would be remiss if I didn’t note that the extent to which a child is programmed by these stories may be directly related to the amount of trauma she has received in early childhood.</p>

In the animal kingdom, baby animals instinctively trust their mother, because the mother usually has an instinct to protect her young. Humans have these instincts as well, but they are subverted by programming inherent in these movies, among other things. By subconsciously identifying with the oppressed princess, the human daughter is subconsciously projecting the role of evil queen onto her mother (or other prominent female caregiver) who then becomes the antihero to the princess. In this way, the mother has become the enemy in her daughter’s eyes, albeit on a subconscious level. It is simple psychology.</p>
<p><strong>Anecdotal Evidence: </strong></p>
<p>I have witnessed this effect in my life, my adoptive mother’s life, and in my daughter’s life. Looking back, I know I projected the evil queen <a href="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/sleepingbeautysavedbyprince.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="876" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/02/25/archetypaltransferencedisneyprincessmovies/sleepingbeautysavedbyprince/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/sleepingbeautysavedbyprince.jpg" data-orig-size="160,119" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="SleepingBeautySavedByPrince" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/sleepingbeautysavedbyprince.jpg?w=160" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/sleepingbeautysavedbyprince.jpg?w=160" class="alignright size-full wp-image-876" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/sleepingbeautysavedbyprince.jpg?w=540" alt="SleepingBeautySavedByPrince" srcset="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/sleepingbeautysavedbyprince.jpg 160w, https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/sleepingbeautysavedbyprince.jpg?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 160px) 100vw, 160px"   /></a>role onto my mother, but did she subconsciously accept that role to a degree? In my mother’s case, she was indeed “rescued” from her family by her so-called “prince”, but it eventually didn’t work out, and they got a divorce, probably because of unrealistic expectations programmed into my mother’s psyche (a Greek word for &#8220;spirit&#8221;). I have to wonder if the woman who unknowingly identifies with the princess role as a child, subconsciously accepts the evil queen role when she enters motherhood, simply because it is the most prominent adult female archetype in movies that programmed her as a child. Could that be part of what happened to my mother (in addition to other forms of archetypal transference), and why I was verbally abused and neglected when I was growing up? My mother was also a narcissist, as are the evil queens/wicked stepmothers in the Disney princess movies, and I spent half of my childhood in a literal “house of mirrors”. Could that have come from the programming from these films? In my daughter’s case, I can see how she has internalized these archetypes, because she certainly acts like a little princess and often treats me as if I were the evil queen. I, however, refuse to accept that role. I love my child and have the natural instinct to protect my child. I projected the Huntsman role from Snow White onto my father, and as such, I put him up on a pedestal, even though he was rarely present in my childhood.</p>
<p>I now have to wonder if the programming from these princess movies is the root cause of why little girls seem to fight their mothers about things that are good for them, such as the way my daughter fights me when I tell her to brush her teeth, eat better foods, do her homework, take a bath, etc. While of course children want to play rather than do homework, would they be more <a href="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/lisahomerpipie.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="866" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/02/25/archetypaltransferencedisneyprincessmovies/lisahomerpipie/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/lisahomerpipie.jpg" data-orig-size="160,115" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="LisaHomerPiPie" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/lisahomerpipie.jpg?w=160" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/lisahomerpipie.jpg?w=160" class="alignright size-full wp-image-866" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/lisahomerpipie.jpg?w=540" alt="LisaHomerPiPie" srcset="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/lisahomerpipie.jpg 160w, https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/lisahomerpipie.jpg?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 160px) 100vw, 160px"   /></a>apt to follow parents’ instructions if they weren’t watching movies and TV shows that make the parents look either like an enemy or unintelligent? In the case of little girls, these princess movies are the biggest suspect, but in the case of little boys, you can simply take a look at television shows such as The Simpsons, which paint the father in a negative light, and make the children out to be smarter than their parents. If you are programmed by these shows to think that you are smarter than your parents, are you going to trust their advice?</p>
<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<p>I have been asked why someone would want to do this. There are a few reasons that I can think of:</p>
<p><a href="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/tangledsexsubliminal.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="856" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/02/25/archetypaltransferencedisneyprincessmovies/tangledsexsubliminal/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/tangledsexsubliminal.jpg" data-orig-size="134,160" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="TangledSexSubliminal" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/tangledsexsubliminal.jpg?w=134" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/tangledsexsubliminal.jpg?w=134" class="size-full wp-image-856 alignleft" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/tangledsexsubliminal.jpg?w=540" alt="TangledSexSubliminal"   /></a>First, you have to <em>follow the money</em>. It is a multimillion (if not billion) dollar industry, aimed at little girls. Princesses are royalty. What do we know about royalty? They have a whole lot of money and stuff. If you can get those children to identify with the princess role, then you can trigger this programming in media, which can then open them up to new programming in your movies, music, television, and advertisements, thereby making them into good little consumers who will buy, or get their parents to buy, anything you make them want. This is done simultaneously with the sexual subliminal messages found in many Disney films, if not all of them, which then brings the child’s subconscious mind to focus on sex (and on baser desires in general), programming which will be played out later, as the child reaches puberty. While the adage “<em>sex sells</em>” is often used in advertising, that is only one reason for <em>sexual subliminals</em>. By focusing children’s subconscious mind on sex, after already setting up the atmosphere of mistrust between parents and children, they will further stray from their parents’ advice, and it will be harder for them to focus on learning, spirituality, or finding a career.</p>
<p>The little girl who subconsciously identified with the “<em>oppressed princess</em>” role will project the “hero/prince” role onto any boyfriends she has as she gets older. However, these males were not programmed by these movies, and thus don’t fit that role very well. In fact, any boyfriend or husband to the female, who subconsciously identified with the princess role, will most likely grow to resent this woman and complain that she is too “<em>high maintenance</em>”. Well, duh, <em>she’s been programmed to be that way</em>! This sets a girl up for a big disappointment that occurs in the unconscious mind when she subconsciously recognizes that her mate can never fulfill the role of “hero/prince”. This will cause a form of cognitive dissonance that the grown woman will not be able to identify, and thus, she will not be able to address or resolve the issue at heart, if she seeks psychological help. The end result of all of this unrealistic programming is depression, among other mental health issues.</p>
<p>If you can get children to mistrust their parents (especially on a subconscious level they cannot recognize), this makes it easier to program them using the media. By the way, this subconscious programming of little children to mistrust their parents is reinforced when they realize the parents have been lying to them about Santa, the Easter Bunny, and the Tooth fairy. Again, this happens on a subconscious level, which makes it all the more insidious and difficult to correct, once the damage has been done. It is easier to program a person who lacks foundational values. This is accomplished as a result of the child being somewhat cut-off from a parent’s protective instinct due to the subconscious lack of trust caused by these movies, as well as certain TV shows. How does one deprogram a child that has had the princess programming reinforced throughout their childhood via the umpteen million Disney princess products on the market (mentioned above)? If a parent tries to raise awareness about the issue to the child, the child is not going to admit that they identify with the Disney princess, or Bart or Lisa Simpson for that matter, because it is not in the conscious mind.<strong> The fact that it is done on a subconscious level is what makes it work so well. People quickly deny it is real precisely because they are unconscious of it.</strong></p>
<p>With these programs in the subconscious mind, triggers can be used to bring this<em> programming</em> to bear in multiple ways. Take the shopping addict for example. Could that be a subconscious reaction to princess programming? How about addiction in general? What about hoarding? Overeating or eating disorders? I already mentioned depression. These mental health issues support an industry already in place: Psychiatric medicine, i.e. pharmaceutical drugs. I feel that many disorders that people suffer are caused by programming, to keep a whole industry running, thereby making a small portion of the population very wealthy from other people’s suffering, without actually curing anything. The only real way to cure some of these issues, in my opinion, is with deprogramming. Most psychiatrists and psychologists out there barely even admit programming exists, much less want to cure it. One begins to see a vicious cycle going on with all of this.</p>
<p>Is it any wonder that Hitler is said to have had a Mickey Mouse figurine on his desk?<a href="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/priestwitherection.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="863" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/02/25/archetypaltransferencedisneyprincessmovies/priestwitherection/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/priestwitherection.jpg" data-orig-size="160,103" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="PriestWithErection" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/priestwitherection.jpg?w=160" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/priestwitherection.jpg?w=160" class="alignright size-full wp-image-863" style="width:184px;height:136px;" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/priestwitherection.jpg?w=540" alt="PriestWithErection" srcset="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/priestwitherection.jpg 160w, https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/priestwitherection.jpg?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 160px) 100vw, 160px"   /></a></p>
<p>So, if you are a mother with a young daughter, and if you decide to expose your little girl to these movies, I ask you to offer parental guidance with these princess movies. I feel that any movie showing a priest getting an erection during a wedding should not be rated G. I don’t buy the story that it is actually the priest’s knees because the erection scene is one lump, not two. Once that initial subconscious separation between mother and daughter is made, then the little girl is directed to follow her <strong>over-sexualized Disney role models</strong>, such as Brittny Spears &amp; Miley Cyrus.</p>
<p>Of course, the extent to which all mind control works on the psyche is dependent on variables in the individual subject&#8217;s life, like how much early childhood trauma they might have had, or whether their parents made any effort to instill values into them, for two examples.</p>

<p><b>Mind Control Using Symbolism in Words and Numbers:</b></p>
<p>There are many methods of <em>mind control</em> that have been uncovered. As most of you know, there is <em>symbolism</em> and <em>subliminals</em> used in movies, music, and television; there are also high tech forms of mind control, using <em>implants</em> (nano or otherwise) and other technologies; there is mind control involving the use of <em>trauma</em> to mess with the human being’s psychology; and then there is the manipulation of language. While the technology I have researched seems to be completely plausible, I am taking a look at language now, because it has been around much longer than the technology currently in use has been, and has a wider scope of impact.</p>
<p><em>Language</em>, including words, names, phrases, and slang, seems to contain a disproportionate amount of <em>negative symbolism</em> (considering many root words), and it can even sometimes be confusing, albeit on a level that is hard to discern. This creates a subconscious and subtle base layer of confusion which then sets the stage for general mind control using other technologies, like movies, music, and television, for example.</p>
<p>Because symbolism bypasses the conscious mind and goes straight into the <em>subconscious</em>, it is a type of programming, especially when used in language, which is learned during the most impressionable years of a child’s life.</p>
<p><b>Here are some words &amp; numbers that should be looked at symbolically, given the way symbolism affects the human psyche: </b></p>
<p>As I&#8217;ve noted in other documents, the word &#8220;<em>psyche</em>&#8221; is a Greek word denoting the <em>spirit</em>, which speaks volumes in itself. So <em>psychology</em>, then, is really the study of the spirit.</p>
<p>Century and Millennia: “cent” means 100, thus a century = 100 years. “Mill” refers to 1000,000, but a millennia = 1000 years (not a million years). Like the way certain months are not in line with their numbering, I contend that things like this can throw the mind out of balance, in a subconscious way, thus making it easier for a person to be programmed by the above mentioned technologies.</p>
<p>Therapist = “the rapist”, which I had picked up many years ago, from a movie called, “Girl Interrupted” (Angelina Jolie’s character says it).</p>
<p>Ever noticed how many names have the word “war” in them? Warburg, Warner, Warren (as in the Warren Commission), are a few. By the way, “war” is not exactly fair, is it, yet there is a term out there known as “warfare”… does this word, because of the way it sounds symbolically, make it so that more people accept war happening in our world?</p>
<p>Which brings us to the expression, “all’s fair in love and war”, but it isn’t true. However, does the prevalence of that expression in our world, subconsciously make people accept things that occur in love and war?</p>
<p>Consider how many words and names have root words like “ill”, “ow”, “mar”, “mal” or “ick” in them. Examples are Bill, Bow, Mark, Malcolm, and Trick, respectively.</p>
<p>Left vs. Right:</p>
<p>Okay, so the word “right” usually refers to the following in the English language: a direction, right handed, correct, the conservative party… phonetically, there is also rite, as in a ritual, or also right as in &#8220;human rights&#8221;, while….</p>
<p>The word “left” traditionally refers to: a direction, left as in the “liberal party”, and left as in “gone”. By the way, left-handedness is often called “south paw”… is there any symbolism there? If right means “correct”, does left symbolically mean “wrong”? Question: What happens if a person is naturally left-handed, but made to be right-handed? I ask this with the knowledge that a stroke in the left hemisphere of the brain has effects on the right side of the body &amp; vice versa. Is this how the whole left-handers are right brained, and right-handers are left brained concept was developed? If someone who is left-handed is made to be right-handed, would it take them out of their right mind, symbolically, metaphorically, metaphysically, spiritually? Some illustrious scientist ought to do a study on the effects of forcing a left-hander to be right-handed, instead of experimenting with brain implants on children from compromised groups (like adoptees). Back in the day, left handedness was considered a sign of being a witch, and meant that a person was “evil”…</p>
<p>This brings me to the word “evil”… Is Eve ill?</p>
<p>While we’re on the biblical: what about “Cain &amp; Abel”? Abel=able (as in “able-bodied”) Cain=cane (as in a tool to help a person walk)… could Cain have been disabled??? Dis Abel (dis-as in disrespect). Is this some kind of a joke? Did Cain really kill Abel? Judging by their names, it seems to me that Cain was disabled. I hope you don’t think I am blaspheming here, because I am simply searching for the truth.</p>
<p>Graven = as past participle of &#8220;grave&#8221;, meaning &#8220;fraught with danger or harm&#8221;.</p>
<p>So are graven images merely images that are fraught with danger or harm? When I look at certain trump cards of the tarot, like the Tower, the Hanged Man, and Death, for example, this seems to be the case. It also seems to be the case in the use and near worship of the crucifix that so many people are fond of. Please see my document: <a href="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2012/09/11/symbolism-mind-control-and-metaphysical-sabotage-in-relation-to-archetypal-transference-and-the-second-commandment-of-the-decalogue" rel="nofollow">https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2012/09/11/symbolism-mind-control-and-metaphysical-sabotage-in-relation-to-archetypal-transference-and-the-second-commandment-of-the-decalogue</a></p>
<p>Justice = &#8220;just us&#8221; (from Jordan Maxwell), but how about “just-ice”?</p>
<p>Why is justice blind anyway? Some people say that this phrase relates the idea that justice is impartial. Well, why not just say “justice is impartial”? I need her to be sighted and to see the whole truth, because I feel like I am being judged for actions or behaviors taken out of context. Why can I not get justice for the horrible things that have been done to me ever since I was taken from my mother at birth, if the United States is supposed to be about “liberty and justice for all”? Alas, the ideal of “justice” has simply become yet another simulacrum in our modern world, only to be found in a clothing line these days.</p>
<p>Government = govern= to control and ment=mind =&#8221;control of the mind&#8221; (from Michael Tsarion)</p>
<p>Horus = “Whore us”</p>
<p>Hermes = “her-me’s”</p>
<p>Masons = “Ma-sons”</p>
<p>Masturbate = “master”, as in ruler, and “bait” as in what you use to go fishing.</p>
<p>Peace = piece=a gun or (piece of?) = peas</p>
<p>Nazi = “Not see” or “Not C”</p>
<p>Frequency = Freak when c or Free Quincy?</p>
<p>Alphabet = alpha (male) bet (wager)</p>
<p>DISC= “dis” “c” (as in disrespect)</p>
<p>Curfew = &#8220;cure few&#8221;</p>
<p>Culture= &#8220;cult&#8221;ure = as in a cult, or as in a petri dish</p>
<p>Television= &#8220;tell-a-vision&#8221;</p>
<p>Metaphor = &#8220;meta&#8221; (above, beyond, before, or about); phor= &#8220;four&#8221; (4th trump of tarot is the Emperor card), so metaphor seems to favor the rulers of this world.</p>
<p>History = “his story” and Hebrews = “He brews” are easy examples of the misogynistic nature of our world.</p>
<p>Women are said to age less gracefully than men. Could the word &#8220;heritage&#8221; have something to do with that?</p>
<p>9= Nine = &#8220;nein&#8221; = &#8220;no&#8221;(from Michael Tsarion)</p>
<p>11= Eleven = El (a name of God, as in “elohim”) even (equal) eleven = 11th trump of various tarot decks (research them: in most, it means &#8220;justice&#8221;, or “strength”, while in one deck, it means &#8220;lust&#8221;). 11th sphere of cabala is supposed to represent &#8220;knowledge&#8221;, but it is often missing from the cabbalistic tree. So does 9/11 equate to &#8220;no justice&#8221;, “no strength, or &#8220;no knowledge&#8221;???? Did all those people die as blood sacrifices to empower some desire for no justice, strength, or knowledge??</p>
<p>12= tw elve as in elves.</p>
<p>Most people recognize that Santa is an anagram of satan</p>
<p>Regarding numbers, would it not throw a young psyche off balance to learn the word “oct” (as in “octagon”) means “eight”, yet October is the 10<sup>th</sup> month? How about “sept” meaning seven, even though September is the 9<sup>th</sup> month? And don’t forget November and December. “Nov” means 9, and “Dec” refers to 10 (see: “Decade”). I have heard one person say that they had added on a few months in the names of Augustus and Julius Ceasar, but that is no reason to name the last four months out of sync with the way they are numbered. Also, a natural calendar would have 13 months of 28 days each, since the word “month” refers to “moon”.</p>
<p>Music= <em>mu</em> (12th letter of greek alphabet) &amp; sic (&#8220;as intentionally so written&#8221;), and also “muse sick”. So this word, <em>sic</em>, could be symbolically felt as “12, as in intentionally so written”. As someone with a 12/12 birthdate, I cannot help but feel I have been programmed.</p>
<p>I have heard some people say &#8220;Obama nation&#8221;&#8230;  it sounds like they’re saying &#8220;abomination” or “Oh bomb a nation”.</p>
<p>So when I hear people speak about <em>freewill</em>, I beg to differ if a portion of us are affected by these negative and/or confusing things in our language. It seems to me that more often than not, people are reacting to situations or circumstances set up long before we were ever born. This kind of destroys the concept of <em>freewill</em> for me. Especially when I consider how my adoptive mother named me with the initials, “C.A.T.”, and didn&#8217;t even like cats. Could that have had something to do with the way I was mistreated and neglected when I was growing up? Then, as an up and coming art student, I met a fellow student with the last name of &#8220;Skinner&#8221;, who was able to somehow steal many of ideas and ended up ruining my career and my life. The phrase, &#8220;How many ways can you skin the cat&#8221; comes to mind. Again, I ask, is this some kind of a joke?</p>
<p>Also, I have heard it said, many times, that animals are more sensitive than people. Could this have something to do with why I had such a hard time dealing with being bullied and neglected by my adoptive parents? They would often tell me I was too sensitive. Could my being “extra sensitive” have something to do with the <em>self-fulfilling prophecy</em> of my mother calling me stupid, and saying that I would never amount to anything?</p>
<p>For those of you who think I am being blasphemous, I ask you to remember that the Bible states that God loves the truth, which is all I am trying to find and talk about. I am sadly reminded of the song, “Blasphemous Rumors”, by Depeche Mode, where they sing, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to start any blasphemous rumors, but I think that God has a sick sense of humor, and when I die, I expect to find him laughing&#8221;. Doesn’t the bible also say that the Truth shall set you free”? I sure hope so. I sure hope that God can see how all my life seems to have been lived as a reaction to a negative programming (including much more than just the language), over which I had no control.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s more to come&#8230;&#8230;.</p>

If you are a &#8220;nonconsentual human experimentee&#8221;, or a monarch victim, then you probably know better.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyQaLSB_JNo&amp;list=PLhnjOlcJU8fNRmgI1Iuvt9z71zbeU9b3C&amp;index=1">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyQaLSB_JNo</a></p>
<p>In this link, I am not attacking those people who are under the assumption that the elites respect freewill, I am simply disagreeing. I believe that they use mind control to remove freewill so they can manufacture consent, after the fact.</p>
<p>Peace.</p>

		<h3 class="result"><a href="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/01/07/occulttechno/" rel="bookmark">Occult &amp; Technological Practices Used on&nbsp;TIs</a></h3>					<p>For those of you who see how there is a bigger, occult picture to the plight of <strong>targeted individuals (TI)</strong>, I ask you to read this with an open mind, and please bear with me, as I know I am repeating a few things I have stated in other posts. This post is about the occult and technological practices used on me and other targeted individuals. I will come out with another post soon, God willing, breaking down this stuff, in a list, in separate groups, under a new heading.</p>
<p>After doing some research, due to my own unfortunate situation of being an <strong>unwitting test subject</strong> with actual implants (that anyone can see &amp; feel), I have discovered that this nation has a history of doing <strong>unethical experiments</strong> on unwitting victims. If you were adopted, this may be the case for you.</p>
<p>From Wikipedia:</p>
<p>&#8220;Many of these tests were performed on children, the sick, and mentally disabled individuals, often under the guise of &#8220;medical treatment&#8221;. In many of the studies, a large portion of the subjects were poor, racial minorities, or prisoners.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_experimentation_in_the_United_States">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_experimentation_in_the_United_States</a></p>
<p>I am struck by the numbers of seemingly intelligent people who deny what has been happening to me, even after I show them the implants in my head. Given the placement of these implants (as shown below), I am saddened by my current situation of being a &#8220;<strong>scapegoat</strong>&#8220;.</p>

<p>After doing some research into adoption scandals, it becomes glaringly obvious that I have been used as an experiment for some very evil, disgusting people, &amp; that I was possibly <strong>stolen</strong> from my mother <strong>at birth</strong>, she being told that I was dead, especially when you consider the fact that I was held in custody of this agency for the first six weeks of my life before being placed into an adoptive family, even though my birthmother was supposedly matched up with my adoptive mother long before I was born.</p>

<p>Although I have tried to contact the agency I was adopted through, I have not yet received a response. Is it that hard for someone to believe that I might have been stolen from my mother at birth, to be used for this hideous program of implantation with <strong>RFID</strong>s &amp; <strong>mind control</strong>?</p>

<p>Considering the fact that the system in place, which allows for these experiments to take place, is and always has been heavily involved in <strong>occult</strong> and evil practices, whereby they seem to like to &#8220;<strong>play God</strong>&#8220;, so to speak, how can I keep my mouth shut?</p>
<p>I am now the unfortunate recipient of voices through these implants, which tell me that I am a <strong>ritual sacrifice</strong>, that I was engineered to <a href="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpthoth.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="221" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2012/09/11/symbolism-mind-control-and-metaphysical-sabotage-in-relation-to-archetypal-transference-and-the-second-commandment-of-the-decalogue/12thtrumpthoth-7/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpthoth.jpg" data-orig-size="184,270" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="12thtrumpthoth" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpthoth.jpg?w=184" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpthoth.jpg?w=184" class="alignright size-full wp-image-221" alt="12th Trump from the Thoth Tarot Deck" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpthoth.jpg?w=540" srcset="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpthoth.jpg 184w, https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpthoth.jpg?w=102 102w" sizes="(max-width: 184px) 100vw, 184px"   /></a>born on <strong>12/12</strong> to be that sacrifice, and tell me exactly how my life was ruined through, not only  through the use of these blasted implants (I am trying not to cuss), not only through the use of mind control via tell-a-vision, movies, and mu-sic, but also through the rampant and uncontrolled use of <strong>symbolism</strong> in <strong>astrology</strong> &amp; <strong>tarot</strong>, which are<strong> archetypes</strong> that infect the <strong>collective consciousness</strong>, &amp; the individual&#8217;s <strong>subconscious</strong>, in the form of <strong>memes</strong>. In my case, as seen in the Crowley-Harris Thoth deck&#8217;s 12th trump, I was not only hanging upsidedown from an Egyptian heiroglyph meaning life, but a serpent is attached to my head. I have heard that <strong>Crowley</strong> was an MI6 agent, and a known satanist. Notice that the figure is also unconscious and has hardly any mouth. Could this have something to do with why so many people ignore me? By the way, many of you who know me, know that <strong>mu</strong>=&#8221;12th letter of the greek alphabet&#8221;, and <strong>sic</strong>=&#8221;as intentionally so written&#8221;. Wouldn&#8217;t a person in this metaphysical position have serious issues? It&#8217;s a miracle I didn&#8217;t end up worse than I am. The upsidedown triangle in the lower right of the card indicates that the victim is female. It seems I have been framed.</p>
<p><a href="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2012/09/11/symbolism-mind-control-and-metaphysical-sabotage-in-relation-to-archetypal-transference-and-the-second-commandment-of-the-decalogue">https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2012/09/11/symbolism-mind-control-and-metaphysical-sabotage-in-relation-to-archetypal-transference-and-the-second-commandment-of-the-decalogue</a></p>
<p>So, I cannot help but feel as if I am being punished for my actions in this life, which were directly affected by all of the things mentioned above, and therefore, I feel the need to defend myself.</p>
<p>I am now the target for all the things that TIs talk about regarding the torture I experience on a daily basis. I get the pinpricks, the itching, the burning, the constant pain, the gang-stalking, street-theater routine, and I have to watch as bits &amp; pieces of my own story get played out in the various forms of media (tell-a-vision, mu-sic, &amp; movies), as do many victims (I have heard one other TI call this the &#8220;Truman Show Effect&#8221;). This is apparently how victims are farmed for the creative inspiration that naturally results from living in a state of severe but unspeakable <strong>oppression</strong>. They&#8217;ve got this down to a science, folks.</p>
<p>Of course, when I try to put videos out about it, I get the <strong>online harassment</strong> from some very cruel and heartless people who cannot possibly think I am crazy when I only posted about my implants and the history of how RFIDs have been used as early as the 1950s, by people like <strong>Dr. Jose Delgado</strong>, which is a well known fact, &amp; quite easy to research. The fact that I posted a video about my RFIDs &amp; not 15 minutes later, was attacked by at least 20 commenters, lets me know that there are indeed, <strong>disinfo agents</strong> out there, just waiting for the chance to earn a few bucks by attacking a target who is speaking the truth. <strong>Discrediting the victim</strong> is a huge part of their wicked, perverted game.</p>
<p>Here is one other example of how a disinfo agent might work. My youtube user name is the same name I have on this site (<strong>musicis2words</strong>). On youtube, not long after I began to make videos, I saw a user with the moniker, &#8220;ignoramusky&#8221;, as in &#8220;ignore-a-mu-ski&#8221;. Is that a joke? Is he getting paid to do that? Must be quite a cushy job. Or how about the job of those who are tasked with the responsibility of surgically mutilating another individual? How are they able to live with themselves, anyway?</p>
<p>I am sadly reminded of the infamous <strong>Stanley Milgram</strong> experiment where people were willing to administer shocks to others, even to the point of causing heart pain, simply because they were told to.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment</a></p>
<p>In the end of it all, I am all too aware of how my <strong>freewill was stolen</strong> from me at birth, and on both physical (implants) and metaphysical (archetypes) levels. Since this is no longer deniable, as I am sure my stalkers are well aware, it becomes very difficult for me to live with the day-to-day degrading and humiliating messages coming from stalkers, both online, in person, and via synthetic telepathy through these implants.</p>
<p>The fact remains that, in my head, at each ear, is <strong>damning evidence</strong> against those who willingly put implants in my head to control my thoughts, emotions, and even my behavior; and in the tarot and astrology is damning evidence that there are indeed occultist elites, running the world, who set individuals like me up, to be made to do things against our will, which makes them directly responsible. I believe this is why I am being tortured. I think they want me dead before I can prove, on a larger scale, what was done to me.</p>
<p>All my life, I felt this absence of higher power, or God. When I was a little girl, I loved <strong>God</strong>, and wanted to serve Him. The bible says that God grantd human beings freewill, but I am saying that humans have taken away a large measure of freewill just through the &#8220;<strong>graven images</strong>&#8221; (images that have become <strong>engraven</strong> into the collective consciousness) of the tarot and astrology, among other things. The bible says that God loves the<strong> truth</strong>, but I have found it increasingly difficult to get anyone to see the truth about what was done to me. What in the world is going on here?</p>
<p>Could I be correct in my attributing the <strong>upsidedown</strong> nature of our world today to the fact that we are living in years surrounding 2012, and the <strong>12th trump</strong> of the tarot is an upsidedown figure in most decks (of which there are over 1,000)? Did those who invented the tarot make that card like that on purpose? Getting it in a reading is supposed to mean &#8220;<strong>redemption through sacrifice</strong>&#8220;, and although my life sure has seemed like one big sacrifice, I have yet to find redemption, in the biblical sense of the term. To me this card is a misuse of what is known as &#8220;<strong>the butterfly effect</strong>&#8220;, whereby a repetion of a vibration increases its amplification.</p>
<p>Okay, so I am ranting now, but everything that I have discovered over the past four and a half years have led me to this point. I so desperately want for the real God, the one who loves each and every one of His creations, to see the truth, and to stop letting me be blamed, and to stop letting me be used, abused, and killed in the process. It&#8217;s no wonder that someone in my position would feel this way. I am accused of all sorts of things that are patently false, as well as some things I am responsible for. However, if I was mind controlled my whole entire life, how can I be blamed? I mean, its not just the archetypal memes, the TV, music, or movies, but it is also <strong>mind control via implants</strong>, which is the most insidious form of mind control I can think of.</p>
<p>It was in 2008 that I discovered the implants, and ever since I have heard audible voices, but for how long was someone &#8220;whispering in my ears&#8221; before I became aware of these things? The idea that a person will not do something under hypnosis that they are not willing to do while conscious has been disproven, so it should be obvious that until I became aware of what was happening, I had been living under a state of <strong>post-hypnotic suggstion</strong>.</p>
<p>For many TIs, life seems like a world where you are the butt of a humungous joke that, until now, everyone has been aware of, but you&#8230; and the joke is, suprise, you&#8217;re being sacrificed! What if this was engineered the whole time that the TI has been living? Would the so-called &#8220;<strong>higher self</strong>&#8221; somehow know this, and have serious issues throughout life because of it?</p>
<p>If you are a TI, I ask you to see if you have the 12 in your <strong>numerology</strong>. It may explain much. Many TIs I have met either have the 12 in their numerology, or they are double digit birthdates.</p>
<p>Another commonality is that many female TIs have some form of the name &#8220;Anne&#8221;, either as a first or middle name. Imagine my suprise on a TI forum, when I saw the moderator&#8217;s email was &#8220;anna-advocate&#8221;, but her group name was &#8220;Jo-Jo-Jive&#8221;. I could just be reading into it, but after what I have been through, I am sensitized to this kind of thing. For example, having initials that spell &#8220;cat&#8221; is used to dehumanize me by my stalkers, but when I looked back on my life and remembered how a woman with the last name &#8220;skinner&#8221; was able to steal and use my ideas, being reminded of the phrase &#8220;skin the cat&#8221;, I am again made to feel like my life is a cruel joke.</p>
<p>It is really just <strong>covert slavery</strong>, which is worse than regular slavery, because the enslaver won&#8217;t even admit that it is happening.</p>
<p>May all TIs find relief from this <strong>heinous crime</strong>.</p>
