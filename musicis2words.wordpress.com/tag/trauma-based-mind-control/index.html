<p>What is normally regarded &#8220;<strong>consent</strong>&#8221; <strong>cannot be considered consent if</strong>: it is forced, coerced, manufactured, mind controlled, silent, inferred, manipulated, uninformed, or misled. I reserve the right to add more to that list as I see fit.</p>
<p>All links provided within this article proves various concepts about which I speak, so I ask you to please take a look at them.</p>
<p>It can only be considered consent if the party consenting knows exactly what all the ramifications are related to that consent.</p>
<p><strong>How many times have you heard or read this phrase: &#8220;<em>Silence equals consent</em>&#8220;?</strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve heard it said by many speakers &amp; writers in the so-called &#8220;<em>truth movement</em>&#8220;. I read recently where it was called a &#8220;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_maxim" target="_blank">legal maxim</a>&#8220;, and that it was authored by Plato, but is also attributed to Sir Thomas Moore in the form of the phrase, &#8220;<a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?SilenceImpliesConsent" target="_blank">Silence gives consent</a>&#8220;. “Silence equals consent” is the way of the elitist pigs, who run the world, to cheat their own game, which is <em>rigged</em>, by the way.</p>
<p>I mean, we already know the ruling class lie, so why believe a maxim that comes from elitist rulers who have filtered this phrase into the <em>truth movement</em> via their own infiltrators?</p>
<p>People talk about &#8220;<em>waking up</em>&#8220;… so what is &#8220;<em>asleep</em>&#8220;? It is when you are so mind controlled you cannot see what the system is doing right in front of your face, you are asleep or unconscious to what is really going on. You cannot &#8220;see the forest for the trees&#8221;, so to speak. If you are not truly conscious of what is happening, then how can you really give consent? In this case, <strong>silence is not consent</strong>.</p>
<p>If you are aware of what is going on, but feel helpless to fight the system because you have been: threatened, manipulated, tortured, deprived, or lost your livelihood, then how is there any consent? You have been coerced. <strong>Coerced consent is not consent</strong>.</p>
<p>Why are people so unconscious? Well, first off, most people are prepped with <a href="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/10/18/trauma-and-its-effects-on-the-psychespirit-reblogged/" target="_blank"><em>trauma</em></a> of some sort, at birth (examples include circumcision, separation from mother, abuse, etc.), or shortly thereafter. Then, they are <em>hypnotized</em> by the <em>flicker rate</em> of TV (which was my babysitter when I was growing up), and then given <em>post hypnotic suggestion</em> via every day phrases like “<em>silence equals consent</em>” or “<em>justice is blind</em>”, as a couple of examples.</p>
<p>That maxim is a lie because silence does not necessarily equal consent. In fact, the maxim of &#8220;silence equals consent&#8221; is <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/silence-means-consent" target="_blank">not even accepted in modern English law</a>. More often it equals fear to speak out, or unconsciousness of the motive and the consequence. At this rate, given the various <a href="http://www.activistpost.com/2010/12/10-modern-methods-of-mind-control.html" target="_blank">methods of <em>mind control</em></a> in existence today, <strong>sometimes even consent doesn&#8217;t really equal consent</strong>.</p>
<p>Whether silence equals consent is immaterial since <strong><em>mind control clearly does not equal consent</em></strong>. Regardless of what form it takes, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyQaLSB_JNo" target="_blank">mind control clearly equals removal of freewill</a>. And, <strong>without </strong><strong>freewill, how can someone give consent</strong>?</p>
<p>It’s kind of like the phrase “<a href="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/09/20/why-is-justice-blind/" target="_blank"><em>justice is blind</em></a>”. They SAY it means that justice is impartial, but that is the lie…. &amp; the system DOES lie to &amp; manipulate the people. The phrase “<a href="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/09/29/memes-law-of-attraction-2/" target="_blank">justice is blind</a>” is like a spell… to make it so justice does not see… so that people do not get true justice. I doubt anyone consented to that except for those who would profit from it.</p>
<p>Even more so, it is like a woman who gave consent to have sex after she had been drugged with <a href="http://earthops.org/rohypnol5.html" target="_blank">ruffies</a>. Was her consent legally obtained?</p>
<p>The stuff we see in the physical world today is the result of control that has been happening for millennia on <a href="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2012/09/07/as-above-so-below-are-we-programmed-by-archetypes/" target="_blank">levels</a> most people cannot even conceive of, much less consider, which is why it works for those with power so well.</p>

<p>Sometimes, consent is SO manufactured that it clearly is no longer consent. As mentioned above, the <a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?Flicker-Rate-and-You&amp;id=1559359" target="_blank">flicker rate</a> of television &amp; movies has a tendency to put people in a semi-hypnotized state. If TV was your babysitter, then you may have spent most of your life in this state, in which case, you may have been the victim of <em>post hypnotic suggestion</em> on a regular basis. Then you have to consider that many people fall asleep with the TV on. I used to do it myself. Looking back, I wonder how much garbage went into my <em>psyche</em>, or how much it affected my life &amp; potential???</p>
<p>If you grew up with TV as a baby sitter, did you consent to it? I don&#8217;t think so. Did I consent to the trauma of a near drowning at 3y/o, whereby I was found floating face-down in a pool? Um, no. Did those little boys consent to genital mutilation in the form of circumcision as newborns? Nope. Does trauma have long term psychological effects on the brain. It sure does. It causes cortisol to be produced which is detrimental to long term memory. Could all the trauma we see in the news, all the false flags, all the actual trauma little babies go through before 3 years old, could all that trauma be caused specifically to make it harder for people to remember &amp; then see the sequence of events that seem to be leading our world into a scientific dictatorship? Where is the consent in that picture?</p>
<p>Does TV <strong>programming</strong> contain <a href="http://subliminalmanipulation.blogspot.com/2010/09/subliminal-messages-in-advertising-in.html" target="_blank">hidden subliminal messages</a> in the design? I feel that has been established by those who have examined various movies &amp; television shows for these <a href="http://theunboundedspirit.com/subliminal-persuasion-hidden-messages-in-images/" target="_blank">hidden messages</a>. Do these hidden messages directly access the subconscious mind when a person has been entranced by the flicker-rate? It seems obvious to me. It is <em>trauma-based mind control</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Trauma is often done at birth, repeated at various stages throughout one&#8217;s life, and is combined with flicker-rate trances &amp; post-hypnotic suggestion. It&#8217;s a formula.</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Consent is manufactured</em> using mind control</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Mind control, by definition, removes freewill</strong>.</p>
<p>Therefore <strong><em>consent</em> for the current systems of slavery</strong>, whether they involve debt, government welfare, nonconsensual human experimentation, or any other form of slavery, <strong>is <em>never legally obtained</em> by the enslaver</strong>, no matter what they try to make us believe.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Trauma and Its Effects on the Psyche/Spirit</strong>  </span></p>
<p>(Links to resources at bottom of article)</p>
<p>Most people these days understand that <em>trauma</em> has <em>psychological effects</em>. If you&#8217;ve been reading my other articles, then you understand that the word <em>psyche</em> derives from both Greek and Latin words that refer to &#8220;<em>spirit</em>&#8220;.</p>
<p><strong><em>Psychology</em> is therefore, the study of the <em>psyche</em> or <em>spirit</em>. </strong></p>
<p><em>Trauma</em> in childhood is recognized in the psychological community as having a negative impact on behavior, causing things like PTSD, Depression, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Borderline Personality Disorder, Antisocial Personality Disorder, Paranoid Personality Disorder, and Schizoid Personality Disorder, to name a few. I suspect that the more trauma a person has in their life, whether in childhood or adulthood, the more problems will manifest in their <em>psyche</em> (<em>spirit</em>), and in their behavior, causing them to be prescribed multiple psych drugs over their lifetimes.</p>
<p>Is this some sort of a formula or what?</p>
<p>While I do have some strong misgivings about the discipline of psychology and their over-emphasis on drugs for behavioral disorders, when there are no real objective tests for most of these disorders, this does not make <em>psychology</em> an invalid science&#8230; just a flawed &amp; corrupted one, in need of more thorough oversight in the community, since it seems like the whole discipline has fallen into the hands of big pharma.</p>
<p>People with <em>PTSD</em> have been found to have elevated stress hormones (cortisol) which can lead to heart disease, and also to the shrinkage of the hippocampus (which affects the transfer of facts from short-term to long-term memory).</p>
<p><strong>Trauma &amp; Circumcision:</strong></p>
<p>After doing some research on the subject of <em>trauma &amp; PTSD</em>, I have noticed that the most common groups studied in relation to this are veterans &amp; children. I find it interesting that no one seems to be studying the effects of trauma in infancy. I realize that this may be more difficult to get anecdotal information from infants, however, one could measure the amounts of cortisol in the brain before &amp; after a <em>circumcision</em>, for example, or before and after a child is taken from its natural mother during the adoption process.</p>
<p>I mention circumcision because it is the mutilation of a male child&#8217;s penis, usually done immediately after birth, unless the child is an orthodox Jew, who will get this done at 13 years old, viewing it as a &#8220;rite of passage&#8221;. When I consider circumcision, I cannot help but consider the long term psychological impact of this practice on a newborn baby. Sadly, the families who allow it &amp; the doctors who perform it apparently do not question the ramifications of this wicked trauma done on a newborn. I think this is why so many males don&#8217;t question going off to war&#8230; they&#8217;ve already been prepped with violence.</p>
<p>Circumcision is a physical assault on the most sensitive part of a male child&#8217;s body, which then makes it a violation of the psyche as well. If considered in combination with the existence of the chakras, this mutilation of an organ in the <em>root chakra</em> has affects on emotions involving <em>security</em> needs. <em>Trauma</em> at such a young age, whether through circumcision or through the unceremonious routines of measuring &amp; weighing, blood testing, a vitamin K shot, vaccines, &amp; drops or ointment in the eyes, would seem to have some sort of emotional impact on the <em>psyche</em> of a newborn baby that is supposed to be experiencing its first few hours bonding with its mother.</p>
<p><strong>About the root chakra:</strong> &#8220;<em>The root chakra is responsible for your sense of belonging, safety, and security in the world</em>.  It’s main concern is <em>survival of the self</em>. (Emphasis Mine) The health of our blood, immune system, bones, joints and spine is dependent on the emotions associated with this chakra. It envelops the body’s basic needs for safety, money, sexuality, groundedness and boundaries.  People who have trouble with their first chakra may not have developed a strong identity and have not discovered their life purpose.  If they are too yin they may be ungrounded.  If they are too yang there might be too much attachment to material things, too much self-indulgence and a preoccupation with satisfaction of their own needs.&#8221;  &#8211; from naturalhealthtechniques.com (link below)</p>
<p>So any trauma in early infancy would naturally have effects on the root chakra, causing security issues in the psyche, which then ripens them up to be conditioned into good little consumers, who are very needy, and often greedy.</p>
<p>Circumcision would of course have the strongest impact of all the &#8220;routine&#8221; procedures done to a newborn after birth. Have you ever seen a circumcision on a newborn baby? The one I saw was awful, &amp; proved to me that babies do feel pain, regardless of what the doctor may tell you. The question is, what are the long term effects of such a traumatic procedure on an infant&#8217;s psyche?</p>
<p>It is my feeling that trauma in infancy &amp; early childhood has a tendency to soften up the mind &amp; make people more easily controlled by the <em>societal conditioning</em>, which is in turn, controlled by the so-called &#8220;<em>hidden hand</em>&#8221; (corporate elites), through the use of education, religion, television, movies, music, literature, &amp; yes, even through the use of <em>brain implants</em>, on par with the research of people like <em>Dr. Jose Delgado</em> &amp; <em>Dr. Ewen Cameron</em>. It sets in the newborn&#8217;s mind, a state of shock, coloring almost everything that happens shortly after birth, including the bonding experience with the parents. I suspect that the traumatized brain of an infant or young child is much more easily hypnotized by the flicker-rate of the television, which is known to induce a trance-like state in those who watch it.</p>
<p><strong>Trauma &amp; Adoption:</strong></p>
<p>There are other traumas that occur during infancy, such as <em>adoption</em>. Now recognized as a traumatic experience by many metal health professionals, with life-long consequences, adoption has a deep psychological impact on the child, leading to a disproportionate number of adoptees seeking help for mental health issues. Adoptees often end up with various forms of attachment disorder, addictions, depression, &amp; obsessive behaviors, to name a few.</p>
<p>While the damage from the aforementioned traumas may have already been done to the psyche, &amp; while some of these people do need medication for the deep psychological issues caused by these events in order to be functional, would it not make perfect sense to examine evidence (measuring cortisol) that is now available with relation to <em>trauma &amp; its effects on the brain</em>?</p>
<p><strong>Trauma Based Mind Control:</strong></p>
<p>Most people who have done any research into the subject of <em>trauma-based mind control</em> understand that it is a powerful way to alter the mind. The more sensational cases of people, like Cathy O&#8217;Brien or Brice Taylor, speak of the splitting of the mind into <em>multiple personalities</em> through the use of trauma. <strong>I contend that the creation of MPD in a person is not necessary for mind control to be achieved</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Learned Helplessness:</strong></p>
<p>Evidence of this concept can be found in the way the American public mostly sat back &amp; watched as their freedoms were eroded in the years following September 11th, 2001. Had they not been repeatedly exposed to the trauma of the event at the World Trade Center, would it have been as easy for those in power to erode American liberties? Does the fact that the United States has been at war for so many years now have a general impact on the <em>collective psyche</em> of its inhabitants, a population which was raised on television? Is it possible that trauma delivered on such a large scale has anchored trauma in infancy or childhood, &amp; induced a state of <em>learned helplessness</em>?</p>
<p>&#8220;The concept of learned helplessness was discovered accidentally by psychologists Martin Seligman and Steven F. Maier. They had initially observed helpless behavior in dogs that were classically conditioned to expect an electrical shock after hearing a tone. Later, the dogs were placed in a shuttlebox that contained two chambers separated by a low barrier. The floor was electrified on one side, and not on the other. The dogs previously subjected to the classical conditioning made no attempts to escape, even though avoiding the shock simply involved jumping over a low barrier.&#8221; &#8211; from psychology.about.com (link below)</p>
<p>The above study was done in 1967.</p>
<p>Please reread that above paragraph &amp; let the information sink in. It shows that <em>repeated trauma</em> can induce a state of <em>learned helplessness</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Trauma &amp; Television in Conditioning:</strong></p>
<p>Traumatize a baby &amp; then sit it in front of the television for a while. Most people go into a sort of trance when watching television anyway, due to the <em>flicker-rate</em> (aka &#8220;refresh-rate&#8221;) effect. Since the child&#8217;s mind is like a sponge, it will suck up all the programming you want. Granted, this is a highly contested statement about television <em>programming</em>, however, it should be considered that, at the very least, watching TV can put a person into a hypnotic, trance-like state, causing things being said to them afterwards to have the possibility of becoming a <em>post-hypnotic suggestion</em>. Hence, advertising.</p>
<p>Let me illustrate this idea: Let&#8217;s say you are a 13 year old kid, watching a couple of hours of TV before bed. Right after you turn that TV off, you hear your dad complaining that you didn&#8217;t take the trash out or get the mail. He gets angry &amp; says that you&#8217;re stupid a number of times. Does this statement that you are stupid have an increased possibility of becoming a <em>self-fulfilling prophecy</em> because you were just in a trance for the past 2 hours before hearing it? Would there be a difference in the effect depending on whether you experienced trauma in infancy or early childhood? Could this have something to do with the reason many victims of mind control programs cite the <em>ritual drowning</em> at 3 years old as being one of their experiences?</p>
<p>It seems to me that trauma has as one of its effects a type of <em>fracture</em> <em>of the psyche</em> or spirit. Setting newborn babies up in this way has caused most of us to end up with an unnatural state of need &amp; insecurity, which is then played on by all sorts of advertising making people desire things they do not need. It also has, as an unfortunate (but possibly intended) side effect: a tendency to cause symptoms such as obsessions, attention deficit disorders, depression, hoarding, paranoia, eating disorders, drug &amp; alcohol addiction, shopping addictions, social anxiety, &amp; other behaviors categorized as <em>mental dysfunction</em>. In reality, these behavioral problems are merely a reaction to adverse stimuli that has occurred since birth, &amp; in some cases, over the course of a lifetime.</p>
<p><strong>Natural Trauma: </strong></p>
<p>There are plenty of traumas that are natural aspects of life. These include birth, loss of a parent, injuries, etc. These natural traumas may cause some issues with the psyche, but they will be healed over time. The problem is that there are so many orchestrated &amp; manipulated traumas in a person&#8217;s life these days, including the examples I mentioned above, that the psyche never gets a real chance to heal.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion: </strong></p>
<p>Between trauma in infancy &amp; early childhood, and trauma witnessed in the news every day, it becomes clear to see an atmosphere of terror is causing these mental/emotional/spiritual issues to manifest in people. The event of what happened to the <em>World Trade Center</em> marked a turning point in traumatizing the masses to allow those with power to enslave the people in such a way, that they would not even recognize their slavery.</p>
<p>Is it any wonder that so many people these days are running to the psych doctor for medication to alleviate their symptoms?</p>
<p>Is it any wonder that people have allowed their civil liberties to be eroded, given the discovery of learned helplessness as related to trauma? This has been going on longer than anyone realizes, &amp; has far reaching implications.</p>

<p><strong>Trauma and Its Effects on the Psyche/Spirit</strong></p>
<p>(Links to resources at bottom of article)</p>
<p>Most people these days understand that <em>trauma</em> has <em>psychological effects</em>. If you&#8217;ve been reading my other articles, then you understand that the word <em>psyche</em> derives from both Greek and Latin words that refer to &#8220;<em>spirit</em>&#8220;.</p>
<p><strong><em>Psychology</em> is therefore, the study of the <em>psyche</em> or <em>spirit</em>. </strong></p>
<p><em>Trauma</em> in childhood is recognized in the psychological community as having a negative impact on behavior, causing things like PTSD, Depression, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Borderline Personality Disorder, Antisocial Personality Disorder, Paranoid Personality Disorder, and Schizoid Personality Disorder, to name a few. I suspect that the more trauma a person has in their life, whether in childhood or adulthood, the more problems will manifest in their <em>psyche</em> (<em>spirit</em>), and in their behavior, causing them to be prescribed multiple psych drugs over their lifetimes.</p>
<p>Is this some sort of a formula or what?</p>
<p>While I do have some strong misgivings about the discipline of psychology and their over-emphasis on drugs for behavioral disorders, when there are no real objective tests for most of these disorders, this does not make <em>psychology</em> an invalid science&#8230; just a flawed &amp; corrupted one, in need of more thorough oversight in the community, since it seems like the whole discipline has fallen into the hands of big pharma.</p>
<p>People with <em>PTSD</em> have been found to have elevated stress hormones (cortisol) which can lead to heart disease, and also to the shrinkage of the hippocampus (which affects the transfer of facts from short-term to long-term memory).</p>
<p><strong>Trauma &amp; Circumcision:</strong></p>
<p>After doing some research on the subject of <em>trauma &amp; PTSD</em>, I have noticed that the most common groups studied in relation to this are veterans &amp; children. I find it interesting that no one seems to be studying the effects of trauma in infancy. I realize that this may be more difficult to get anecdotal information from infants, however, one could measure the amounts of cortisol in the brain before &amp; after a <em>circumcision</em>, for example, or before and after a child is taken from its natural mother during the adoption process.</p>
<p>I mention circumcision because it is the mutilation of a male child&#8217;s penis, usually done immediately after birth, unless the child is an orthodox Jew, who will get this done at 13 years old, viewing it as a &#8220;rite of passage&#8221;. When I consider circumcision, I cannot help but consider the long term psychological impact of this practice on a newborn baby. Sadly, the families who allow it &amp; the doctors who perform it apparently do not question the ramifications of this wicked trauma done on a newborn. I think this is why so many males don&#8217;t question going off to war&#8230; they&#8217;ve already been prepped with violence.</p>
<p>Circumcision is a physical assault on the most sensitive part of a male child&#8217;s body, which then makes it a violation of the psyche as well. If considered in combination with the existence of the chakras, this mutilation of an organ in the <em>root chakra</em> has affects on emotions involving <em>security</em> needs. <em>Trauma</em> at such a young age, whether through circumcision or through the unceremonious routines of measuring &amp; weighing, blood testing, a vitamin K shot, vaccines, &amp; drops or ointment in the eyes, would seem to have some sort of emotional impact on the <em>psyche</em> of a newborn baby that is supposed to be experiencing its first few hours bonding with its mother.</p>
<p><strong>About the root chakra:</strong> &#8220;<em>The root chakra is responsible for your sense of belonging, safety, and security in the world</em>.  It’s main concern is <em>survival of the self</em>. (Emphasis Mine) The health of our blood, immune system, bones, joints and spine is dependent on the emotions associated with this chakra. It envelops the body’s basic needs for safety, money, sexuality, groundedness and boundaries.  People who have trouble with their first chakra may not have developed a strong identity and have not discovered their life purpose.  If they are too yin they may be ungrounded.  If they are too yang there might be too much attachment to material things, too much self-indulgence and a preoccupation with satisfaction of their own needs.&#8221;  &#8211; from naturalhealthtechniques.com (link below)</p>
<p>So any trauma in early infancy would naturally have effects on the root chakra, causing security issues in the psyche, which then ripens them up to be good little consumers, who are very needy, and often greedy.</p>
<p>Circumcision would of course have the strongest impact of all the &#8220;routine&#8221; procedures done to a newborn after birth. Have you ever seen a circumcision on a newborn baby? The one I saw was awful, &amp; proved to me that babies do feel pain, regardless of what the doctor may tell you. The question is, what are the long term effects of such a traumatic procedure on an infant&#8217;s psyche?</p>
<p>It is my feeling that trauma in infancy &amp; early childhood has a tendency to soften up the mind &amp; make people more easily controlled by the <em>societal conditioning</em>, which is in turn, controlled by the so-called &#8220;<em>hidden hand</em>&#8221; (corporate elites), through the use of education, religion, television, movies, music, literature, &amp; yes, even through the use of <em>brain implants</em>, on par with the research of people like <em>Dr. Jose Delgado</em> &amp; <em>Dr. Ewen Cameron</em>. It sets in the newborn&#8217;s mind, a state of shock, coloring almost everything that happens shortly after birth, including the bonding experience with the parents. I suspect that the traumatized brain of an infant or young child is much more easily hypnotized by the flicker-rate of the television, which is known to induce a trance-like state in those who watch it.</p>
<p><strong>Trauma &amp; Adoption:</strong></p>
<p>There are other traumas that occur during infancy, such as <em>adoption</em>. Now recognized as a traumatic experience by many metal health professionals, with life-long consequences, adoption has a deep psychological impact on the child, leading to a disproportionate number of adoptees seeking help for mental health issues. Adoptees often end up with various forms of attachment disorder, addictions, depression, &amp; obsessive behaviors, to name a few.</p>
<p>While the damage from the aforementioned traumas may have already been done to the psyche, &amp; while some of these people do need medication for the deep psychological issues caused by these events in order to be functional, would it not make perfect sense to examine evidence (measuring cortisol) that is now available with relation to <em>trauma &amp; its effects on the brain</em>?</p>
<p><strong>Trauma Based Mind Control:</strong></p>
<p>Most people who have done any research into the subject of <em>trauma-based mind control</em> understand that it is a powerful way to alter the mind. The more sensational cases of people, like Cathy O&#8217;Brien or Brice Taylor, speak of the splitting of the mind into <em>multiple personalities</em> through the use of trauma. <strong>I contend that the creation of MPD in a person is not necessary for mind control to be achieved</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Learned Helplessness:</strong></p>
<p>Evidence of this concept can be found in the way the American public mostly sat back &amp; watched as their freedoms were eroded in the years following September 11th, 2001. Had they not been repeatedly exposed to the trauma of the event at the World Trade Center, would it have been as easy for those in power to erode American liberties? Does the fact that the United States has been at war for so many years now have a general impact on the <em>collective psyche</em> of its inhabitants, a population which was raised on television? Is it possible that trauma delivered on such a large scale has anchored trauma in infancy or childhood, &amp; induced a state of <em>learned helplessness</em>?</p>
<p>&#8220;The concept of learned helplessness was discovered accidentally by psychologists Martin Seligman and Steven F. Maier. They had initially observed helpless behavior in dogs that were classically conditioned to expect an electrical shock after hearing a tone. Later, the dogs were placed in a shuttlebox that contained two chambers separated by a low barrier. The floor was electrified on one side, and not on the other. The dogs previously subjected to the classical conditioning made no attempts to escape, even though avoiding the shock simply involved jumping over a low barrier.&#8221; &#8211; from psychology.about.com (link below)</p>
<p>The above study was done in 1967.</p>
<p>Please reread that above paragraph &amp; let the information sink in. It shows that <em>repeated trauma</em> can induce a state of <em>learned helplessness</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Trauma &amp; Television in Conditioning:</strong></p>
<p>Traumatize a baby &amp; then sit it in front of the television for a while. Most people go into a sort of trance when watching television anyway, due to the <em>flicker-rate</em> (aka &#8220;refresh-rate&#8221;) effect. Since the child&#8217;s mind is like a sponge, it will suck up all the programming you want. Granted, this is a highly contested statement about television <em>programming</em>, however, it should be considered that, at the very least, watching TV can put a person into a hypnotic, trance-like state, causing things being said to them afterwards to have the possibility of becoming a <em>post-hypnotic suggestion</em>. Hence, advertising.</p>
<p>Let me illustrate this idea: Let&#8217;s say you are a 13 year old kid, watching a couple of hours of TV before bed. Right after you turn that TV off, you hear your dad complaining that you didn&#8217;t take the trash out or get the mail. He gets angry &amp; says that you&#8217;re stupid a number of times. Does this statement that you are stupid have an increased possibility of becoming a <em>self-fulfilling prophecy</em> because you were just in a trance for the past 2 hours before hearing it? Would there be a difference in the effect depending on whether you experienced trauma in infancy or early childhood? Could this have something to do with the reason many victims of mind control programs cite the <em>ritual drowning</em> at 3 years old as being one of their experiences?</p>
<p>It seems to me that trauma has as one of its effects a type of <em>fracture</em> <em>of the psyche</em> or spirit. Setting newborn babies up in this way has caused most of us to end up with an unnatural state of need &amp; insecurity, which is then played on by all sorts of advertising making people desire things they do not need. It also has, as an unfortunate (but possibly intended) side effect: a tendency to cause symptoms such as obsessions, attention deficit disorders, depression, hoarding, paranoia, eating disorders, drug &amp; alcohol addiction, shopping addictions, social anxiety, &amp; other behaviors categorized as <em>mental dysfunction</em>. In reality, these behavioral problems are merely a reaction to adverse stimuli that has occurred since birth, &amp; in some cases, over the course of a lifetime.</p>
<p><strong>Natural Trauma: </strong></p>
<p>There are plenty of traumas that are natural aspects of life. These include birth, loss of a parent, injuries, etc. These natural traumas may cause some issues with the psyche, but they will be healed over time. The problem is that there are so many orchestrated &amp; manipulated traumas in a person&#8217;s life these days, including the examples I mentioned above, that the psyche never gets a real chance to heal.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion: </strong></p>
<p>Between trauma in infancy &amp; early childhood, and trauma witnessed in the news every day, it becomes clear to see an atmosphere of terror is causing these mental/emotional/spiritual issues to manifest in people. The event of what happened to the <em>World Trade Center</em> marked a turning point in traumatizing the masses to allow those with power to enslave the people in such a way, that they would not even recognize their slavery.</p>
<p>Is it any wonder that so many people these days are running to the psych doctor for medication to alleviate their symptoms?</p>
<p>Is it any wonder that people have allowed their civil liberties to be eroded, given the discovery of learned helplessness as related to trauma? This has been going on longer than anyone realizes, &amp; has far reaching implications.</p>

Even still, there are those people, like some bloggers, who say it is something like &#8220;a godlike entity manipulating humanity&#8221;. I even read where one blogger overheard his handlers referring to him as &#8220;<strong>the sacrifice</strong>&#8220;.</p>
<p>As a victim of this, it becomes very difficult to know what the actual truth is. I am harassed with voices, directed conversation, pain, some sort of radiation hits in the chest, crotch, head, to the point where I honestly don&#8217;t understand what is happening. I am not alone in this, as I have read &amp; seen many other victims of this horrendous crime speak out about the exact same things. One begins to wonder if God is really a cruel entity allowing these things to go on, or worse, causing them, which is something I really <em>don&#8217;t want</em> to believe. If I am wrong about this, then I beg forgiveness, but I am confused about this issue.</p>

In my case, however, the very visible &amp; obvious <strong>implants</strong> in my ears make it all to clear that someone has been controlling me throughout my life. Since it is well-known that <strong>Dr. Jose Delgado</strong> was doing his research into <strong>brain stimulation</strong> with implants back in the 1950s &amp; for at least 20 years, it is not hard to imagine that I might&#8217;ve been sold into this &#8220;<strong>program</strong>&#8221; as a baby, through adoption. I have noticed that there is a predominance of adoptees &amp; foster kids who are victims, who blog &amp; vlog about this horrible situation. This is telling.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m so sorry for those who are suffering through this. <em>No one deserves it</em>, especially when you consider the overarching problem at the root of all of this. The problem that I see is that mind control has been happening on some level, for centuries at least. Mind control, by definition, <em>removes</em> freewill, &amp; there are many ways in which mind control is used to subtly influence people. The <strong>flicker rate</strong> of tv &amp; movies alone is enough to hypnotize people, especially children. Any <strong>subliminal messages</strong> in movies or television, such as hidden <strong>symbolism</strong>, access the <strong>subconscious mind</strong> directly, especially while people are in a <strong>trance</strong>. It is the manipulation of the human mind, which again, removes freewill.</p>
<p>It does seem that <strong>trauma</strong> plays a role in how much of an impact mind control has on an individual. It is now professionally recognized that adoption is a trauma for the baby, so it stands to reason that being placed in foster care, or any separation of a child from it&#8217;s natural parents would then also be traumatic. What about other traumas that occur in infancy &amp; early childhood? Like the near drowning at 3 years old, cited by so many ritual abuse victims? How about circumcision at birth? What about the onslaught of tests, immunizations, goo in the eyes, separation from mother, endured by most newborns born in hospitals? Could it be that these early traumas have a purpose beyond what is stated regarding the reasons for what is cited above?</p>

We were totally <strong>brainwashed</strong>. I can only imagine how many veterans (who were programed to be heroes, via TV &amp; movies) are now being mentally harassed, blamed for everything they might&#8217;ve done during wartime. I say this because I know that I am constantly blamed for things in my past, even though it is clear that <em>I never truly had freewill</em> in my life, do to the many ways in which I was affected by mind control.</p>
<p><strong>I have observed multiple ways a &#8220;system&#8221; can exert mind control over it&#8217;s population:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1) Religion</strong>&#8211; Religion has a long history of being used to control the masses. Children are brought up in a religion &amp; know nothing else. Most of these religions are pagan in origin, but vehemently deny that fact, &amp; then carry on with obvious pagan traditions. This would naturally cause a conflict in a child&#8217;s mind. The bible warns that &#8220;Christians would be persecuted in the so-called &#8220;end times&#8221;. Is it a coincidence that I know a fellow TI who&#8217;s name is &#8220;Christian&#8221;? I doubt it.</p>
<p><strong>2) Education</strong>&#8211; The educational system in the US especially, has a specific slanted point of view. If a child does not internalize this point of view, they end up with poor grades &amp; labeled as losers.</p>
<p><strong>3) Parenting</strong>&#8211; Parents have a specific point of view &amp; want their children at least to understand it, but some parents enforce their point of view on their children. But worse than this is the fact that some parents simply leave their kids alone most of the time, only giving negative attention to them. This is a form of <em>negative programming</em>.</p>
<p><strong>4) Media (TV, movies, music, talk radio, etc.)-</strong> Growing up with the mass media, I can attest to the fact that it shaped my beliefs, especially since I had negative programming from my own parents, &amp; was mostly left alone by them. Television was my primary baby sitter. There are subliminals in movies &amp; television to be sure, but also in music. Some messages are in the form of cleverly hidden artwork or backwards masking, but others can be found in the themes, which get repeated over &amp; over in multiple movies &amp; stories viewed by adults &amp; children alike. As I&#8217;ve seen others point out, there is a reason why they call it &#8220;television programming&#8221;. There are those who will vehemently deny that subliminal programming exists, even when it is right in your face (see <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmMnnOr-lYQ"><br /> Subliminal Sex Messages and Pornography in Advertising and Cartoons </a>). However, the flicker rate of television &amp; movies alone is enough to put people in a trance, especially when in front of the big-screen. Ever notice how large tv screens are these days? And why all that push for people to get HDTV even to the point of giving away free converters to people? Ever since that happened, it sure seems like things changed really quickly. It is like Orwell&#8217;s <strong>1984</strong>, just a little bit different.</p>
<p><strong>5) Language</strong>&#8211; If you take a good, hard look at the English language, you will find negative root words in many other words &amp; proper names. I have a video on this, called <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMe5Y4Hs_7c">&#8220;Mind Control Using Symbolism in Language and Numbers&#8221;</a>. A couple of examples though: how many words can you find with the root words mar, war, ill, or ow in them? This attests to how society, which learns language very young, is controlled by a very negative base program. There is this symbolism inherent in our language, some of it is visual (reading), while some of it is phonetic (hearing). You might consider your own name &amp; how you might&#8217;ve been treated by others throughout your life based on it.</p>
<p><strong>6) Controlled Opposition Groups</strong>&#8211; These are groups formed with the specific intent of controlling any opposition to the &#8220;system&#8221; (i.e. cult-ure or society). They are often, but not exclusively, from other countries, coming over to the US to alert people to the existence of mind control. Then, when people begin to wake up, they are targeted by the system that wants to defend its existence. They use mind control techniques such as NLP (neuro-linguistic programming) to give them a powerful influence on people.</p>
<p><strong>7)</strong> <strong>Occult Practices</strong>&#8211; Mind Control has been going on at least since the Pharos in Egypt, but more likely, it goes back to the Druids. They&#8217;ve been using drugs &amp; hypnotism for centuries, possibly much longer, and believe it or not, black magic &amp; voodoo are also involved. They are pushing forth an intent to influence individuals &amp; society as a whole, using <strong>meta-physical technologies</strong>, the knowledge of which has been passed down through their generations, the result of which has effects on the spirit of a person. Psyche comes from a Greek word referring to the spirit. Knowing the psychology of human beings allows for a greater influence over them.</p>
<p><strong>8)</strong> <strong>Implants &amp; Other Physical Technologies</strong>&#8211; When I consider the work of Nazi scientists &amp; the fact that the US brought them to this country under &#8220;<strong>Project Paperclip</strong>&#8221; to continue their experiments, it becomes extremely difficult for me to ignore the possibility that people are actually sold into programs of mind control experimentation, sometimes by their own parents. Technologies such as brain implants (see Dr. Jose Delgado&#8217;s work in the 1950s &amp; 60s), are used to completely wreck a person&#8217;s life or to enhance it.</p>
<p>The positive implications for mind control make it absolutely disgusting that they are using it to influence so many people in such negative ways. I mean, they could use it to help people quit smoking, for example, or to make people more successful &amp; therefore allow them to make better contributions to the world. So, why wouldn&#8217;t they?</p>
<p>It is my theory that those who are responsible for the most intense aspects of mind control, such as implants, do actually use<img data-attachment-id="924" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/07/04/mind-control-and-the-targeted-individual/goldendawn/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/goldendawn.jpg" data-orig-size="200,282" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="goldendawn" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/goldendawn.jpg?w=200" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/goldendawn.jpg?w=200" class="alignright  wp-image-924" alt="goldendawn" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/goldendawn.jpg?w=128&#038;h=181" width="128" height="181" srcset="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/goldendawn.jpg?w=128&amp;h=181 128w, https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/goldendawn.jpg?w=106&amp;h=150 106w, https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/goldendawn.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 128px) 100vw, 128px" /> it for positive purposes, but only on pre-designated people (i.e. the ones they can control the most), while for others (the ones they deem as the &#8220;losers&#8221;), it is used to keep that class of people down. It seems that they are keeping a balance by doing this: one group is brought to new heights, while the other is brought to extreme lows.</p>

The hexagram is prominently displayed in the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, &amp; it is also used in Theosophy. Both of these organizations, among others, are so-called &#8220;Secret Societies&#8221;, who, like the Freemasons, allow only those at the very top of the hierarchy to know the full truth of their methods &amp; practices, and what their role is in society at large. The hexagram is only one example of a <em>meta-physical technology</em>.</p>
<p>Those who are TIs are suffering as a result of being put at the pinnacle of an upside-down triangle, while their &#8220;chosen ones&#8221; are placed at the top.</p>
<p>It is also my theory that the ones who are held down, throughout their lives are then used for the creative inspiration that naturally comes from this sort of <strong>oppression</strong>. This inspiration gleaned from victims ultimately shows up in TV, movies, &amp; music, which means that there is a whole class of people benefitting from another class&#8217; suffering. It is an unspoken, unacknowledged form of <strong>slavery</strong> that can only result in emotional issues for the <strong>unwitting victims</strong>. These issues would then cause the victim to act out in a variety of ways, throughout their lives, since on some subconscious level, they probably know that they have been <strong>covertly enslaved</strong>.</p>
<p>This makes the <strong>TI</strong> the ultimate <strong>muse</strong> for an elitist system that sees people as mere &#8220;<strong>human resources</strong>&#8221; to be &#8220;utilized&#8221;. Trying to get any compensation or justice for what has been done to them, simply makes them look &#8220;crazy&#8221; or schizophrenic to those who don&#8217;t understand such a thing. However, part of me wonders if maybe everyone around the victim is well <img data-attachment-id="755" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/01/28/mcusingarchetypaltransference/justiceblind/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/justiceblind.jpg" data-orig-size="106,160" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="justiceblind" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/justiceblind.jpg?w=106" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/justiceblind.jpg?w=106" class="alignright size-full wp-image-755" alt="justiceblind" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/justiceblind.jpg?w=540"   />aware of the nightmare going on in front of their faces &amp; simply refuse to acknowledge it, lest the victim have a foothold into getting any justice for what has been done. There is a reason why &#8220;<strong>justice is blind</strong>&#8221; is a well-known phrase in this world, &amp; it has absolutely nothing to do with impartiality.</p>
<p>I am pretty sure that the idea of justice is now nothing more than a simulacrum of the original concept.</p>
<p>In my own situation, it seems that my whole life has been orchestrated, unbeknownst to me until more recently. I only just began to wake up to the situation in 2008, which is, coincidentally, the same year that I discovered I had implants in each ear. Symbolically &amp; psychologically, my life seems to have been completely manipulated to make me negative, sad, confused, depressed, &amp; apathetic. I have even seen how some of the more &#8220;metaphysical&#8221; technologies affected my adoptive mother&#8217;s life.</p>
<p>Some people would call what is happening to Targeted Individuals an affliction, but I would call it an <em>infliction</em> because it is inflicted on us by some other entity or entities.</p>
<p>When you present obvious evidence &amp; people don&#8217;t believe you, it can be extremely frustrating. Many of the same people who admit that the powers that be are using symbolism to manipulate human beings, will then deny the possibility that a person has been manipulated in this way. Many people who admit that there is all sorts of technology being used against people will then deny that implants exist, even though Dr. Delgado&#8217;s work in brain stimulation is well-known. This seems to be by design &amp; with the intent of driving the victim mad.</p>
<p>This will result in further discrediting the victim, who has most likely already had a smear campaign done against them. Those involved in these kinds of <strong>psyops</strong> (psychological operations), with the intent of destroying the victim&#8217;s life, credibility, sanity, and health, really deserve to be cursed to live the life they are consigning victims to.</p>

I talked about how these movies become a form of <em>programming</em>, causing a little girl to subconsciously identify with the princess role, and unconsciously project the roles of other characters onto prominent people in her life. I mention how these movies, and the reinforcement of their programming via countless princess products on the market, seem to have the effect of causing females to be “<em>high-maintenance</em>”, and drive a wedge between mothers and daughters on a subconscious level. I also mention how <em>sexual subliminals</em> serve to inhibit spiritual growth by focusing the subconscious mind on baser desires in general.</p>
<p>What I neglected to discuss in the original document (<a href="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/02/25/archetypaltransferencedisneyprincessmovies" rel="nofollow">https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/02/25/archetypaltransferencedisneyprincessmovies</a>) is a concept known as “<strong>learned </strong><strong>helplessness</strong>”. This form of learned helplessness differs from the more commonly known definition of the term, which describes an animal or person who experiences this effect when they are exposed to repetitive abuse and trauma, with no escape (see below). The form of learned helplessness I am referring to comes as a result of being programmed by movies that feature the male “<em>hero</em>”, and the female “<em>damsel in distress</em>”. By and large, the majority of princess films and action movies reinforce these archetypes, and encourage females to subconsciously play the role of victim who will ultimately be rescued, which sets them up to be victimized for real, as they become adults, only, in many cases, that rescue never comes.</p>
<p>A key point here is that a female, who has been programmed in this way, winds up with a <em>victim mentality</em> &amp; tends to identify herself in relation to her mate. This allows for very limited personal, emotional, intellectual, or spiritual development, which may result in an inability to become a whole person in her own right, depending on how extensive her programming is.</p>
<p>As I mentioned in my earlier document, the effects of this programming may vary, depending on the amount of <b>trauma</b> in a person’s life, due to the effects of trauma on the brain.</p>
<p>Not only are little girls programmed by these so-called feminine archetypes, but boys are usually programmed to be completely different, so men and women end up having personalities which seem to conflict. This programming seems to begin at birth, when boys are assigned blue and girls are assigned pink. On the color wheel, pink and blue are neither side-by-side, nor are they compliments. So on a symbolic level, males and females are immediately programmed to conflict with each other. I cover this in more detail in another article.</p>
<p>There does seem to be an agenda out there to disempower women on a subconscious level. While there are some movies out there that show strong female characters, the majority of fantasy and action movies especially, feature a strong male who must rescue a helpless, or at least less capable, female. Another type of programming in these movies can be seen in how the male role has growth and character development that is not found, or is negligible, in the female role.</p>
<p>Being exposed to these archetypes, over and over again, certainly becomes a form of subconscious programming.</p>
<p>Again I find myself wanting to understand why this is happening on such a large scale.</p>
<p>Well, I have heard one author say that we are dealing with “man’s ancestral hatred of women”. The subjugation of women would certainly be explained by this idea. We must ask ourselves: has it served society, humanity, and our planet for this particular theatrical theme to be repeated ad-nauseum? I think not. In fact, one thorough look at the state of our world shows how no one seems to be completely satisfied with our current reality. In fact, even the wealthy seem to be trapped in a state of subconscious and insatiable need. One need only to look at the various forms of addiction that exist in our world to see this is the case. The proliferation of war, poverty, and disease shows us that the current locus of societal control is not where it should be. The number of people who have so-called mental illnesses is staggering these days. Could this be a byproduct of the imbalance perpetuated by this programming? Perhaps if a more natural order was allowed to develop in human society, then we might see a better world, whereby everyone can be satisfied and live in harmony with one another. Instead, most of us are being programmed by these stereotypes and archetypes that seem to have become the hallmark of an unnatural system, bent on usurping the power of others, both male and female.</p>
<p>Programming allows for no individual development, forces people into predefined roles, and removes a measure of freewill. It also makes people more predictable and therefore easier to control. However, since it is done on such a <b>subconscious</b> level, most people do not recognize it and think that they are behaving in ways that are natural to them.</p>
<p>So is there any way out of this outdated rut of a program that we all seem to be adhering to, on some level or another? Well, one way would be if everyone stopped watching and exposing their children to these movies that reinforce these stereotypical roles onto people, but I don’t see that happening anytime soon. Therefore, the only way out would be to rise above this sort of programming. However, I have noticed that when I tried to rise above this programming, it seemed to kick in even stronger, and I felt a serious backlash from males.</p>
<p>There’s one more thing I want to throw out there, considering my recent research. I have been examining a certain acronym, about which there seems to be some debate regarding what the letters stand for. After hearing of how Hitler supposedly had a mickey mouse figurine on his desk, and after recognizing the existence of something called “<b>Project Paperclip</b>”, I have to wonder now if the MK in “<b>MK Ultra</b>” actually represents the words “Magic Kingdom”. I say this because there is a huge conglomerate monster involved in manufacturing Disney-based products, and perpetuating the programming therein, and there does seem to be a form of magic being used on people through these movies, and through programming in general, which not only divides women from men, but also has a tendency to make women into adversaries of each other, ala Cinderella’s stepsisters (for one example). The concept of “divide and conquer” keeps coming up when I look at the control of the human race through programming, in all its forms. By the way, does it strike anyone as odd that there is a Disney Land in California and a Disney World in Florida?</p>
<p>With regard to what I have read about the illuminati being formed in 1776: I feel that is complete disinfo. I say this because it seems like there has always been some elite group of people controlling the majority of the populations of this world. Even when there have been good men trying to bring people out of slavery and oppression, they seem to either get coopted or killed. I hope that this state of affairs doesn’t last. It is not a healthy system, and leaves most people disturbed on a subconscious level, leading them to have some emotional issue of one form or another, often causing some form of addiction, i.e. overeating, drugs, gambling, etc. as a way of coping with an unseen form of slavery which no one is allowed to notice, much less talk about.</p>
<p>It seems to me that we are indeed living in a world where an unseen form of slavery exists- just ask any TI who has experienced “intellectual property theft” or the “<b>Truman Show effect</b>”. Also, after considering the mass programming of female children, as mentioned above, it is not surprising to find the statistic out there stating that 75% of TIs are female who possess advanced educations and/or high IQs. This fact tells me that the power and abilities of this group are being usurped by a system that wants no challenges to its programming and authority, and would apparently like the majority of women living in the world to have low IQs and less education. Seeing the potentiality of this section of the population, in advance would behoove that system to preprogram these women into a victim mentality.</p>
<p>After reading my documents, and/or watching my videos, one might have the opinion that I am a feminist. I’m really not that. I don’t know what I am. What I do know is that the system in which most of us are living is unnatural and causes more problems than it solves. The fact that, in most cultures, women are subjugated and their opinions are often discounted by men and women alike, tells me that the way females &amp; males are programmed could be a big part of the problems that are manifesting in our world today. If women were allowed to retain their natural strengths and abilities (meaning: if women weren’t programmed to be somewhat helpless and at odds with other women including their own mothers), would the world be a better place? Perhaps there would be fewer incidents of women trapping men by getting pregnant. Maybe there would be less “cattiness” exhibited between women. The only way to find out would be to try. Generally speaking, men have been in charge of the ruling organizations of this world for too long and the results have been favorable to the ruling class, and detrimental to the majority of the population, but I suspect that, on a spiritual level, it hasn’t really served either group.</p>
<p><strong>About Learned Helplessness:</strong></p>
<p>From <a href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1380861/learned-helplessness" rel="nofollow">http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1380861/learned-helplessness</a></p>
<p>“learned helplessness, in psychology, a mental state in which an organism forced to bear aversive stimuli, or stimuli that are painful or otherwise unpleasant, becomes unable or unwilling to avoid subsequent encounters with those stimuli, even if they are “escapable,” presumably because it has learned that it cannot control the situation.</p>
<p>The theory of learned helplessness was conceptualized and developed by American psychologist Martin E.P. Seligman at the University of Pennsylvania in the late 1960s and ’70s. While conducting experimental research on classical conditioning, Seligman inadvertently discovered that dogs that had received unavoidable electric shocks failed to take action in subsequent situations—even those in which escape or avoidance was in fact possible—whereas dogs that had not received the unavoidable shocks immediately took action in subsequent situations. The experiment was replicated with human subjects (using loud noise as opposed to electric shocks), yielding similar results. Seligman coined the term learned helplessness to describe the expectation that outcomes are uncontrollable.</p>
<p>Learned helplessness has since become a basic principle of behavioral theory, demonstrating that prior learning can result in a drastic change in behaviour and seeking to explain why individuals may accept and remain passive in negative situations despite their clear ability to change them. In his book Helplessness (1975), Seligman argued that, as a result of these negative expectations, other consequences may accompany the inability or unwillingness to act, including low self-esteem, chronic failure, sadness, and physical illness. The theory of learned helplessness also has been applied to many conditions and behaviours, including clinical depression, aging, domestic violence, poverty, discrimination, parenting, academic achievement, drug abuse, and alcoholism.”</p>

<p>My mind control case is not as sensational as those of Cathy OBrien or Brice Taylor, because my situation is much more covert, is is therefore more sinister, since I cannot point to the actual perpetrators of the crime against me, that started when I was born.</p>
<p>Much of my mind control programming has been done via implants at each ear, the size of <strong>RFID</strong>s, Which are suspiciously located exactly where the external part of a cochlear implant would be (although mine go through the cartilage and are under the skin), possibly linking directly into my <a href="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/rightsideimplant.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="250" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2012/09/11/symbolism-mind-control-and-metaphysical-sabotage-in-relation-to-archetypal-transference-and-the-second-commandment-of-the-decalogue/rightsideimplant-4/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/rightsideimplant.jpg" data-orig-size="154,205" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;2.8&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;KODAK EASYSHARE M863 DIGITAL CAMERA&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1196959494&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;5.7&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;160&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.063055&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="RightSideImplant" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/rightsideimplant.jpg?w=154" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/rightsideimplant.jpg?w=154" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-250" style="width:135px;height:189px;" title="RightSideImplant" alt="Implant with circle to indicate location" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/rightsideimplant.jpg?w=112&#038;h=150" width="112" height="150" srcset="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/rightsideimplant.jpg?w=112&amp;h=150 112w, https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/rightsideimplant.jpg 154w" sizes="(max-width: 112px) 100vw, 112px" /></a>brain, which allows the <strong>perpetraitors</strong> (misspelled on purpose to denote that these people are indeed<em> traitors</em> to their own country because they are violating innocent human beings from birth and well into adulthood, possibly for one’s entire life), to do their evil, unseen by me, so I cannot point to specific persons to accuse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I cannot blame the adoption agency, Catholic Charities, directly, because I can no longer find the article where I saw that they were indicted for child trafficking, although I did see it in a news story on television. Since I cannot back up the claim with any proof, I cannot make the claim.</p>
<p>I recently received a link from a kind reader, showing me how the Catholic church in Spain was involved in trafficking over 300,000 babies, telling their mothers their babies had died at birth:</p>
<p>&#8220;300,000 babies stolen from their parents &#8211; and sold for adoption: Haunting BBC documentary exposes 50-year scandal of baby trafficking by the Catholic church in Spain&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2049647/BBC-documentary-exposes-50-year-scandal-baby-trafficking-Catholic-church-Spain.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2049647/BBC-documentary-exposes-50-year-scandal-baby-trafficking-Catholic-church-Spain.html</a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a sick thing going on in the catholic church. If they&#8217;ve been doing it over in Spain, is it any stretch to think they might have done it to me and sold me into a mind control program, putting implants in my head as a baby during the first 6 weeks of my life, when I was in the agency&#8217;s custody?</p>
<p>That being said, most people who have done any research on children who are used in experiments are frequently from orphanages. It also must be noted that many targeted individuals that I know are adopted or were in foster homes.</p>

<p>Satanic Ritual Abuse is a well-known phenomenon, yet most people I speak to about it won’t recognize that it might have happened to me, in combination with mind control.</p>
<p>I am constantly being threatened by these voices to be thrown in jail, framed for something I haven’t done. My answer to those who are using these implants not only for telemetry, but also for broadcasting, is that if I ever end up in front of detectives or a judge, I will tell these people that I have these implants, and that those who did it, or those who are subordinates of those who did it, are interested in me being put away so I cannot talk about what has been done to me during my lifetime. <strong>Mind Control, Satanic Ritual Abuse, and the Occult go hand in hand.</strong> Knowing that the Constitution seems to no longer safeguard the public from these situations, I urge the reader to examine the following in relation to my implants (given that when they were implanted, in my infancy or early childhood, the Constitution was supposed to have protected me from such a violation):</p>

The<strong> implants</strong> make it more insidious because I cannot point directly to some evil mind like Dr. Cameron or Dr. Mengele and sue them, since they were probably implanted in my head when I was a baby, so I would not retain a memory of the procedure, nor remember the pain from it. Since I was in the agency&#8217;s custody for the first six weeks of my life, this seems to be the most likely time when it would&#8217;ve happened. My programming was more subtle, and less proveable than mind control victims like Cathy O&#8217;Brien or Brice Taylor, except for the implants, which I have so far been unable to get looked at by a professional.</p>
<p>The fact that I was denied disability, despite the fact that I have a history of mental issues, such as a suicide attempt at 17y/o, a record of drug abuse (which is <strong><em>common for people suffering from mental issues related to mind control, ritual abuse and/or</em> <em>neglect</em></strong>), records of visits to various psychiatrists and psychologists throughout my lifetime, including three baker acts, tells me that the <strong>judge</strong> who did my hearing is indeed <strong>crooked, or at least terribly misinformed</strong>. I have been made disabled on purpose, with neglect, mental abuse, mind control, and satanic ritual abuse. Now I am targeted as if I am being punished for the way I have been set up in the first place.</p>
<p>Despite my emotional problems related to abuse, up until 4 years ago, I always worked my butt off for every dime I ever earned.  That all changed when I began to remember some of the things that happened to me. I became the target for what is now being called “no-touch torture” or electronic harassment. It is well-known in psychological studies that traumatic memories of ritual abuse and mind control often come out in one’s forties. I began to hear voices in my forties, accompanied by memories of abuse, and that is when my life fell apart. Whether diagnosed for PTSD, or for schizophrenia (which seems to be one of the aims of mind control practices- to discredit the victim), either way, they are diagnoses worthy of disability, to say the least, and possibly a criminal investigation to exactly what happened to me. This last note is with the idea in mind that I have implants for crying out loud! Of course, I was denied disability by a judge, who ought to lose her job.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when I research mind control and ritual abuse, I find that most doctors and law enforcement are a part of this network of destroying lives.</p>
<p>When I began to have memories of certain incidents come back to me, such as an instance of my mother leaving me alone crying in the crib for hours, telling me to “eat shit and die”, or her blowing cigarette smoke in my face (she smoked 3 packs a day), or my uncle blaming me for my Aunt’s heart attack, or being wrapped in a blanket and tossed down the stairs by my brother, to come out of the blanket and find both my parents laughing and pointing their fingers at me, that is when my character was assassinated, I lost my job writing articles, and my whole life commenced falling apart. It seems like I was intentionally discredited, so that I would not be able to get any real help for my situation.</p>
<p>Among people I have spoken with regarding the implants, there seems to be some disagreements as to what these things in my head (through which I hear voices and feel buzzing sensations) are. I have had one person say they are “cutaneous horns”, which I have looked up, and what I have are subcutaneous, so that couldn’t be it. When I did a search for &#8220;subcutaneous horns&#8221;, I found only photos of &#8220;cutaneous horns&#8221;. I had a <em>psychologist</em> try to tell me they are keloids, which they obviously are not, since keloids are on the skin, not under it, and since <em>what I have</em> <em>looks nothing like keloids</em>. By the way, from what I understand, people with keloids do not hear things through them, nor do they feel vibrations through them, and people with cutaneous horns have not mentioned that they hear or feel anything through them either. One other thing of note, regarding my implants, is the fact that if I put my finger in the top part of my ear, on the other side of where the implant is, I can feel a nub there. So the things in my ears are oval shaped, and both ends of them can be felt. This means they go through the cartilage of my ears.</p>
<p>To these people who do not believe me, why doesn’t one of them, or all of them combined, help me get one of these implants taken out of my head, to <a href="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/rfid_rice_fingers.png"><img data-attachment-id="561" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2012/12/16/i-am-a-human-being/rfid_rice_fingers/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/rfid_rice_fingers.png" data-orig-size="225,225" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="RFID_rice_fingers" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/rfid_rice_fingers.png?w=225" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/rfid_rice_fingers.png?w=225" class="alignright size-full wp-image-561" alt="RFIDRiceFingersComparison" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/rfid_rice_fingers.png?w=540" srcset="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/rfid_rice_fingers.png 225w, https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/rfid_rice_fingers.png?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px"   /></a>determine what they really are? Then we could see the truth of the matter. I mean, they ARE the size of <strong>RFID</strong> tags. Perhaps I haven&#8217;t been able to get any help because they do not want the truth to get out. I am forced to assume this, given the circumstances of my character assassination, the loss of my job, the fact that all of my friends and neighbors have been convinced to ignore me.</p>
<p>One example of how my situation clearly looks like a mind control case is that the <strong>mirrors</strong> used in my <strong>programming</strong> were everywhere within the home I lived in for the 2<sup>nd</sup> half of my childhood. There was a mirrored coffee table, mirrored wallpaper, a mirrored pedestal for chrome art, mirrored dressers, mirrored closet doors, mirrored end tables, mirrored switch plates, mirrored cotton ball dispensers, and mirrored art on the walls. Using mirrors is a well-known method of mind control cited in the Springmeier/Wheeler book. Another example is that I had the classic near-drowning at the age of 3, which is common to ritual abuse survivors.</p>
<p>The RFID tags would have been enough, and they have probably been using them my whole life to mess with my head, possibly while I slept. Yet, no one wants to believe it’s possible that this could be happening to me, even though when I was born, in the late 60s, programs of mind control were more than established. <strong>Dr. Jose Delgado</strong> was able to stop an implanted, charging bull with a remote control in 1963. <a href="http://www.wireheading.com/delgado/brainchips.pdf">http://www.wireheading.com/delgado/brainchips.pdf</a></p>
<p>I had a surgery for cervical dysplasia in 2004, under a general anesthetic. I have had a flashback of something horrible and unthinkable that happened to me during that procedure. It is a flashback because I can see the masked doctor and my mother, I can hear the whirring instrument, I can hear my mother’s voice, and I can hear my own screams while I am being mutilated. I have had a psychologist say to me, “I know you like to tell stories”. To her, I can only hope that one day, she goes through something like this and no one believes her. As a result of this procedure, I now have a condition called vulvodynia, which usually results from <strong>trauma</strong> to the area. Of course, I have been so far, unable to get it treated. This procedure is most likely why I became afraid of lawn mowers in 2008.</p>
<p>It is my sincere hope that I will be able to find an honorable doctor and/or attorney to help me with my situation. I may not be able to point the finger at any one person and sue them (unles it is the adoption agency that sold me into this horrible experiment), but perhaps I could at least get some decent treatment for my issues, so I can go back to work and lead a normal life.</p>
<p>Some people who read this may assume that I am just trying to get attention. This is false. I am trying to raise a kid while these implants are delivering very malicious messages into my mind. It is a very difficult situation I find myself in. I never dreamed that I was a mind control victim, and I certainly do not wish to be. The only attention I am trying to get is that of an honrable doctor or attorney to help me get one removed so I can get a serial number from it and track down the manufacturer.</p>
<p>It is my fear that I was sold into slavery via this Catholic adoption, just to be implanted at birth, so I could be the subject of this horrible, evil mind control, via these implants, so that I could be made a ritual sacrifice for these evil creatures that should get eaten by their own kind for what they&#8217;ve done.</p>
