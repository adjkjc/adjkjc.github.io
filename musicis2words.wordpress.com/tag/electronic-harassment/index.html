<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>In our world right now, there actually is no shortage &amp; no real reason to engineer the genocide that has been occurring through multiple methods for the past 50 to 100 years. The shortage has been contrived &amp; all of the wealth is in the hands of the <strong>banksters</strong> (at the top of the pyramid), who have the largest carbon footprint, yet try to make the masses feel guilty for theirs.</div>
<div></div>
<div>As the elites at the top of the pyramid kill off those at the bottom (debt slaves) with the myriad of technologies at their disposal, including vaccines, abortion, drugs, soft-kill, and much more, those who are one level up from the current victims will be next, &amp; on up until there is only 1/8th of the pyramid left because the top 1 or 2 percent have gotten their slaves to make the machines that will do all the work needed to sustain them.</div>
<div></div>
<div>It is the ultimate <strong>pyramid scheme</strong>.</div>
<div></div>
<div>This is what perpetraitors (who will be next once they&#8217;ve killed their targets) of high tech gang stalking, electronic harassment, &amp; gaslighting do not understand&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Yet.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The saddest part is, that had the wealthy &amp; powerful (who pretty much have stolen their wealth through the ages, btw) actually allowed all human beings to live up to their true potential, their insidious plan of multi-tiered genocide would not be needed for them to be content.</div>
<div></div>
<div>My only comfort is in the knowledge of the fact that this whole mess the elites have caused will ultimately come back to bite them in the ass, because they will eventually be forced to feed on themselves once they&#8217;ve killed the rest of us off. Or maybe the machines they&#8217;ve used the slaves to manufacture will destroy them.</div>

<p align="center"><strong>Born Into Slavery</strong></p>
</div>
<p>In 2009, I was told by a complete stranger on the street that I was “<em>sold into slavery</em>”. Given the events of my life, and the fact that I was adopted through a Catholic agency, it is not out of the realm of possibility. It did not take me much research to learn of the history <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/forced-adoptions-for-unwed-mothers-around-the-globe.html" target="_blank">Catholic organizations have with child trafficking</a>, dating back in the 1960s, at least. I have been told that I was sold into slavery with the specific purpose of being a <em>ritual sacrifice</em>. There is no justification for what was done to me.  There may be more to be added to this document in the future, but I wanted to get it out before I die, or am imprisoned for some crime I haven’t committed. I fear this might be done in order to silence me. I have found myself to be a TI (<strong>Targeted Individual</strong>), but given the events in my life, I feel I have always been a target.</p>
<p>Before reading this, I would like you to have an answer to a common question I get from people who doubt what I am saying is true. I have had people ask me, &#8220;<strong>Why you</strong>?&#8221;, &#8220;Why would they pick you?&#8221;, and my favorite, &#8220;<strong>What makes you so special</strong>?&#8221;</p>
<p>Here is my answer: Why <em>not</em> me? I mean, if I am part of some experiment, does that question have any relevance at all? You might as well ask <a href="http://psychology.about.com/od/historyofpsychology/p/harlow_love.htm" target="_blank">why Harry Harlow picked a particular monkey to be used in an experiment</a>, or <a href="http://http://www.wireheading.com/delgado/brainchips.pdf" target="_blank">what made Dr. Jose Delgado use that particular cat for his experiment with brain stimulation</a>? I was adopted &amp; the records were sealed, so I</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" alt="This is from an  experiment done in the early 1950s, where a cat was made to lift its hind leg in response to brain stimulation." src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/delgado-cat.jpg?w=150&#038;h=91" width="150" height="91" /></p>
<p>don&#8217;t know if my birth mother was from some bloodline or not. I don&#8217;t know the circumstances surrounding my adoption. Just being adopted through a catholic agency puts one at risk for being stolen, which then puts one at risk for becoming an unwitting participant in a <em>human experimentation</em> program. Of course, I am not implying that all adoptees are victims of <strong>nonconsensual human experimentation</strong>, only that they are at a greater risk for it, since their records are often sealed. After seeing a show on TV where a baby was being taken from its mother, I wondered if I cried like that was I was taken from my birth mother.</p>
<p>I do not know how long the implants have been there. I believe it may have been done to me when I was a newborn, during the adoption process. I suspect this to be the case, since I was in a hospital for a period of time after my birth, &amp; since I never had pain at the cites of the implants. They go all the way through the cartilage in each ear. I need to have a doctor look at them, perhaps with a CT, MRI, or PET scan, although I prefer to have at least one of them removed. Since I have lost my job and have no insurance, this is hard to do. It doesn’t seem like anyone is willing to truly help me with this. Here are the photos of them:</p>
<p><a href="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/rightsideimplant.jpg"><img title="RightSideImplant" alt="Implant Right Side" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/rightsideimplant.jpg?w=154&#038;h=205" width="154" height="205" /></a><a href="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/leftsideimplant.jpg"><img title="LeftSideImplant" alt="Implant Left Side" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/leftsideimplant.jpg?w=150&#038;h=200" width="150" height="200" /></a> These are photos of my implants&#8230;.</p>
<p><a href="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/rfid_rice_fingers.png"><img alt="RFIDRiceFingersComparison" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/rfid_rice_fingers.png?w=150&#038;h=150" width="150" height="150" /></a> This is an image I found at &#8220;lovingenergies.com&#8221;, showing the size of RFID chips. The implants in my ears are exactly that size.</p>
<p>It should be noted here that the word <a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=psyche" target="_blank">&#8220;<strong>psyche</strong>&#8221; <strong>refers to the spirit</strong></a>, in both Greek &amp; Latin. Thus psychology most likely refers to the study of the spirit, but they don&#8217;t tell you that in school.</p>
<p>In 2008, I began to audibly hear what is being transmitted through these implants. I also found myself in near constant pain in my privates. The psychologist I saw, since I was made to appear delusional, tells me that I just have to live with the pain, but this is not really living. When I told her about the implants, which are very provable, she replied that they could be keloids, which are scars. This not possible, considering what keloids look like versus what I have on my ears. These are keloids:<img class="alignright" title="Keyloid" alt="Keloid Example" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/keyloidc.jpg?w=254&#038;h=198" width="254" height="198" /></p>
<p>Keloids (photo shown right) are ON the skin, while what I have is clearly UNDER the skin. I hear voices through the implants, and I also feel what can only be described as “impact sensations” through them. I had one person tell me that they were cutaneous horns, but those are also on the surface of the skin, not under it. Given the fact that I was adopted through a <em>catholic agency</em>, it is very possible that these implants have been with me my whole life, since the Catholic church certainly has more than one black mark on it&#8217;s record concerning it&#8217;s treatment of children.</p>
<p>When I discovered my implants in 2008, began to uncover my memories, and notice how orchestrated my life has been, I became a target for the worst kind of <strong>character assassination</strong>. I lost my job, my family, my world. I was abandoned in a foreclosed house, in which I lived with no power or water for almost 3 years. No one would help me, and the only way I could get a ride, or a warm place to stay during the coldest winter nights was if I allowed certain men to kiss and/or touch me.</p>
<p>I believe the implants in my head have been a major part of my problem throughout my life, &amp; that, had I not been implanted, my life would have turned out very differently. A little research into the work of Dr.s <a href="http://cabinetmagazine.org/issues/2/psychcivilization.php" target="_blank">Jose Delgado</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.wanttoknow.info/mkcourtcase.shtml" target="_blank">Ewen Cameron</a> (to name a couple), whose work in mind control goes as far back as the 1940s in some cases, will show that this is indeed possible. It is not only possible, but very likely, that these implants have been delivering subliminal messages throughout my life, or at least throughout their existence in my head. The proof is in the photos above. No one can say I am delusional regarding their existence or their placement in my head. I hear voices throughout them telling me I am a demon, or Satan himself, and that I am being killed &amp; sent to hell. How’s that for a mind #@*!? I also hear high-pitched tones (on one side or the other-not ringing), and feel impact sensations, coming through these implants that I cannot seem to get a doctor to look at. Sometimes, the voices will tell me I am going to be framed for something, but I am a completely law-abiding citizen. Voices that were once subliminal are now broadcast 247 into my head to keep me in terror by calling me a criminal even though I am breaking no laws, telling me I am marked for death, going to jail, that I am just food, etc. At one point, I was at an amusement park with my daughter watching a show, when I felt a directed energy weapon attack: it felt like a hot poker going into my back and straight through my left lung, which I am sure is done to make it look like I died of lung cancer.</p>
<p>I must be a victim of either MK Ultra or the Monarch program, not only because I have these implants, not only because I had the classic near-drowning at 3y/o, or have had programming terms spill out into my conscious mind, but because it simply looks like my entire life has been orchestrated for the specific purpose of making me negative and to turn me away from God. At any rate, I can show that I have not been allowed much “freewill”, and its ending result was one of catastrophe. I am not even sure “freewill” even exists, hence the quotations. <strong>I urge any target reading this to read it completely, and then examine your own life</strong> <strong>to see how you may have been manipulated in relation to your name and/or birthdate, especially in regards to music and movies, as well as the tarot, used as a programming device, as opposed to a fortune-telling device. </strong>I am the victim of what can only be called <em>Mind Control</em>, regardless of what program was used. Taken separately, the events of my life may not look like Mind Control to most people, but when considered together, it cannot be denied that what happened to me was a classic PSYOPS experience or experiment, resembling The Truman Show, except in my case, I was debased, debilitated, and dehumanized on a fundamental level, whereas in the movie, they show the main character was raised by loving and attentive parents. After what I have learned about myself, and what I have witnessed in this country and the world, I am now forced to consider that the kinds of things that were done to me are occurring, in some level (even if a more subtle level), on a global scale, in order to make the whole of society unbalanced and unwell, and thereby easily manipulated by the hidden ones in power and the power structure. I am not writing this to disrespect my parents, which will be seen as my story continues below, as I know they too were controlled by this machine.</p>
<p>I have learned that certain occult brotherhoods, interested in making blood sacrifices, will force a woman to give birth on a certain day. I believe that my birthmother was more than likely induced to have me on 12/12, because of the predominance of that number in our culture, and its association in most tarot decks. I was adopted at 6 weeks, but I remember a photo of my father holding me and I looked like a newborn, which makes me think I was premature. They would do this to make sure that I would be weak and more easily manipulated.</p>
<p>The classic near-drowning at 3 years old, which I will document below, is known to be used in mind control &amp; ritual abuse. <a href="http://healthland.time.com/2013/01/16/childhood-trauma-leaves-legacy-of-brain-changes/" target="_blank"><strong>Trauma</strong> such as this causes actual changes within the brain</a>. I believe that the ritual drowning at 3y/o is done on purpose to contribute to destroying people&#8217;s true potential &amp; making them easier to control. Adoption itself is a trauma, in that it is not natural for a baby to be separated from their natural parents at birth.</p>
<p>Another thing that shows I was manipulated to be negative is the fact that I was forced to write with the right hand, against my natural inclination to be left-handed. This was done by telling me, when I was learning to write, that left-handedness was evil. If the right hemisphere of the brain generally controls the left side of the body, as evidenced in studies of stroke victims, what does this imply for someone who is naturally left-handed, but forced to be right-handed? Is it possible that doing this to me could have “<strong>switched my poles</strong>”, causing a bright and intelligent child to slowly lose her natural God given gifts? Is it also possible that switching someone’s natural handedness could make them negative, less intelligent, unbalanced, and emotionally unstable? I believe it should be looked into. I believe that changing my natural, God given, left-handed nature caused me to lose ambition, creating a state of apathy &amp; confusion, over time, and is at least partly responsible for my negativity. This is evidenced by the fact that when I was in grade school, I had a high IQ, and was in the top 2% of my class, but over time, my grades fell dramatically. I was lucky to graduate high school with a C average. While my mother’s negative influence in my life is, of course, partly responsible for this, I would have most likely been more self-motivated, had I been allowed to keep my natural left-handedness. This could also have something to do with what I document next.</p>
<p>There are many who believe that the tarot can be used to tell someone&#8217;s future, and others who would say it is meant to help people work through their psychological issues, but given my story, and how much it relates to a certain tarot deck (A. Crowley&#8217;s Thoth deck), I find myself thinking that these images had an unnatural and cruel programming type of an effect on my life, as did many other things in art, music, movies, and TV. After a certain amount of detective work, I have learned why.</p>
<p><strong>“Life imitates art far more than art imitates life” –Oscar Wilde</strong></p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, I was born on 12/12/1967. I think it is very possible that the assignment of the number 12 in the trumps of almost every tarot deck, in addition to the prevalence of the number 12 in the bible and in culture, has also had a subliminal effect on me throughout my life, having a specific impact on my ego. In the tarot, the 12th card of the major arcana is usually The Hanged Man, an upsidedown person. Due to the patterns of my life closely relating to the Thoth deck, I feel that I may have been programmed with it. I have met one other person with a 12/12 birthdate, and he also feels like his whole life has been cursed. I certainly cannot deny the possibility, given the fact that my adoptive mother, born on 4/4, had a life that mimics exactly the 4<sup>th</sup> trump in that deck. In the Thoth deck, the Hanged Man’s right foot is tied to an upsidedown Ankh, which is the Egyptian symbol for life and fertility. I find it sad that my ideas about life and fertility were always skewed in this way, although I had not known about this card for the majority of my life. As far as I know, I had never seen it, however, I must now question if I was shown this card in my youth, as some part of a mind control program. I only say this because of its serious and deleterious effect on my life. While I knew of my birthdate, I never really associated myself to that number on a conscious level, rather I have always identified with the number 3, possibly because I was baptized Catholic and received first communion.  I have to wonder if being born on this birthdate has affected others in similar ways, but I suspect that it depends on how the person is raised (including trauma in early childhood) in addition to their birthdate, name, numerology, tarot correspondences, and astrological sign, in addition to whether they were part of this mind control program that I seem to have been put through.</p>
<p>When one takes into account the occult nature of those who would be involved in such practices as <strong>MK Ultra</strong> and the <strong>Monarch Program</strong>, it is very possible that the tarot was used in conjunction with dark magic and mindcontrol, to create a peculiar pattern in my life that closely resembled the energy of the Hanged Man card throughout most of my life, causing me to blame God for everything in my life, turn away from the church given its history of killings and hypocrisy, and eventually sign a contract with a character named Enki (a Sumerian god), whom I was mindcontrolled into believing was the true God. I was only searching for the One True God of the Universe, and everything the churches were seen to be doing turned me away from them. By forcing my life into such a negative pattern (inverted-like the Hanged Man card), as you will see if you read this whole document, it was easy to turn me away from the God of the bible, making me believe that the bible lied. Given how the images from the tarot have affected me &amp; other people I know, however, I now understand why the second commandment in the Bible states, &#8220;<strong>No Graven Images</strong>&#8220;. This is about something called &#8220;<a href="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2012/09/07/as-above-so-below-are-we-programmed-by-archetypes" target="_blank"><strong>archetypal transference</strong></a>&#8220;.</p>
<p>Here are pictures of the, The Emperor and The Hanged Man, from the Thoth tarot:</p>
<dl class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_98" style="width:195px;">
<dt><img title="4thTrumpThoth" alt="4th Trump of the Thoth Tarot deck" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/4thtrumpthoth1.jpg?w=185&#038;h=272" width="185" height="272" /></dt>
</dl>
<p>While it seems that we have all been mind controlled to some degree, I see my case as slightly different from most people, only because of my mother’s 4/4 birthdate and my 12/12 birthdate, and how they were used against me. My mother’s card, The Emperor has so many symbols relating to her life that it was impossible for me to ignore. There are two rams (Aries) behind her (they &#8220;had her back&#8221; so to speak): the one on the left, representing my father, who always took care of her even after the divorce; and the ghostly one on the right, my grandmother who is deceased. The figure has one 8-point star in a circle (eight balls?) on either side, which represent my cousin and my brother, both born in August, whom she regarded fondly. The lamb at the bottom, represents me, from whom she was always looking away. This lamb is holding a flag, &amp; one could say I was a flag waver for certain causes, such as Greenpeace (back in the 1980s). The Emperor is holding a ball with an equal-armed cross on it, so it is a coincidence that my mom was a trophy-winning bowler?</p>
<p><a href="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/12thtrumpthoth3.jpg"> </a></p>
<p>In my case, The Hanged Man is nailed down and unconscious, symbolizing how I have been unaware of what has been happening to me my entire life. Already mentioned is the fact that the figure is hanging upsidedown, from the Egyptian symbol for life and fertility, which shows how my entire life has been inverted. The fact that the figure has no clearly definable genitalia (just a lump of flesh in that position), is significant of castration, symbolic <img class="alignright" title="12thtrumpthoth" alt="12th Trump Thoth Tarot" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/12thtrumpthoth3.jpg?w=184&#038;h=270" width="184" height="270" />of the pain I am in today and have been suffering from since the middle of 2008. The serpent in the card represents the serpent class (or satan), connected via rays to the figure’s head, makes it seem that they are able to read my thoughts, to be displayed in some <em>altered</em> form, in movies, TV, but especially in music. One example of how my life has been played out in some form, in music, can be seen in the Beatles&#8217; song, &#8220;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&#8221;, where George Harrison sings: &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how you were inverted.&#8221; Another example would be the Kate Bush song, “Experiment IV” (4th trump=Emperor), in which she describes “a sound that could kill someone from a distance”, which relates to all the negative energies sent to me from my adoptive mother with that 4/4 birthdate. It is already well known that mind control is often addressed in music &amp; movies. One thing I want to note here is that the things they are doing to mind control victims are played out in music in movies, so that when anyone complains of the effects of targeting and mind control, they can be dismissed as delusional (&#8220;Ah, you&#8217;ve been watching too many movies, man&#8221;). However, all one has to do is see how, even some political candidates, such as Connie Marshall (KY), and celebrities, such as Randy Quaid (his case told on YouTube), are now complaining of targeting, to understand that this is anything but a delusion.</p>

Notice, for example, the following words: Bill, chill, mill, kill, till, all have the root words “ill” in them; and how the words bow, chow, cow, pow, sow, all have the root “ow” in them. It might mean nothing, yet it could still have a <em>subliminal effect</em>. I looked up the word “music” as two distinct words; <strong>mu</strong> and <strong>sic</strong>. Taken individually, they are defined as follows: <strong>Mu</strong>&#8211; 12th letter of the Greek alphabet, a lost continent in the Pacific Ocean, an opiate receptor, among many other things, and is a root in many words in the English language; and <strong>Sic</strong>&#8211; Intentionally so written, As written, A command to attack (as in “sic the dog”). That being said, one also has to take into consideration the sound of the word, “music”, as in “<strong>muse sick</strong>”. When I think of these definitions, and the way my life has been, I realize that my life seems orchestrated by some unknown entity, and I am praying that God would not do this to an individual. For example, my initials happen to spell “cat” (although my mother has confessed to not really liking cats), and when I was in school to be an artist, a woman entered that school, with the last name of “Skinner”, and somehow she was able to end up with many of my ideas without me telling her. I see this as related to the phrase, “skin the cat”. Later, she would introduce me to heroin at a vulnerable time in my life, which helped to ruin my career &amp; my life.</p>
<p>My initials, C.A.T., seem to have been given to me, with the specific intent of <em>dehumanization </em>(possibly as part of this sick experiment). I have read that many</p>
<p><img class="alignright" alt="Monarch Butterfly Cat" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/monarchbutterflycatp.jpg?w=150&#038;h=110" width="150" height="110" /></p>
<p>survivors of the Monarch program are given “cat alters”, although I am not a multiple personality. I do think I have repressed memories, since I have heard programming break through to my conscious mind. I am a Mind Control victim who was adopted (as some would say, &#8220;<em>sold into slavery</em>&#8220;) through Catholic Charities, but was held in the agency&#8217;s custody for the first six weeks of my life, creating an attachment disorder, causing me to be a very emotionally needy child. Unfortunately, my adoptive parents were either unable or unwilling to fill this need. I ask myself why my mother would me name me something with the initials spelling CAT, when she never really liked cats. My parents had a natural born, ten year old boy when I was adopted. My mother’s maiden name was Gaeta, so when she married, it became Nay Gaeta &#8220;negator&#8221;, which is a cruel symbolic irony regarding the effect she had on my life. She was in her thirties when I was adopted. She smoked three packs of cigarettes a day, which is possibly why she had two miscarriages before I was born. She used a method of child-rearing, common in the 1960s, which advocated leaving the child to cry and/or scream for hours in the crib without responding. This method of caring for a baby is cruel, and I cannot imagine why anyone who loved their children would do this. I am sure that it causes or contributes what is known as “attachment disorder”. My parents were upper middle class, so in the absence of love, they gave me material things. My father, working a job that kept him out of town frequently, wasn&#8217;t around much, and I felt his absence. Although she seldom had to work, my mother was also never around much, leaving the raising of me up to myself, and various nannies that would come and go during the first nine years of my life. My brother, who was ten years older than me, was usually away at boarding school. I had the classic near-drowning at 3 years old (common among Ritual Abuse victims), and I am told that my brother saved my life when I was found floating face-down in the pool, although considering the accounts of RA victims and participants (who are also victims) throughout the world, I now have no idea what the real truth is.  In any case, it is possible that this was a <strong>ritual drowning</strong>, done to bring me to a near death experience, which would then allow for spiritual and demonic influence in my life, and/or easier mind control.</p>
<p>My brother has told me that our mother was caught shaking him when he was a baby, and had to be watched, which is why we ended up with nannies during the first eight or nine years of my life. If this is true, I have to wonder where our nanny was when I fell out of the crib during one of those times when I was left to scream in the crib, by myself. That being said, I do know that my mother had an obvious mean streak in her (The Emperor-remember), and I did witness her beating on my brother when I was around five, and he was fifteen. I know she was beaten by her own father, and I suspect she was sexually abused as well, so I am not trying to show disrespect for her or my father, as I know they were both victims of their own programming, as were their parents before them.</p>
<p>My parents got divorced when I was around 9 years old, and I took it hard because I really needed my dad in my life. My dad moved out of state, and my mother and I moved out of the family home. We ended up in the place where <strong>I spent the second half of my childhood, in a literal house of mirrors</strong>. This is why <strong>I call it PSYOPS (PSYchological OPerationS), because living in a house of mirrors during my childhood had a direct psychological impact on me</strong>. We had mirrored bedroom suites, mirrored coffee table, mirrored wallpaper, a mirrored pedestal with a steel sculpture, mirrored sliding closet doors, mirrored shower doors, mirrored art on the wall, mirrored tissue dispensers, mirrored cotton ball holders, and even mirrored outlets and switch plates. I am not exaggerating here. There was only one room in the house that didn’t have this décor, and it still had one big mirror on the back wall, behind the bar. I know this had an effect on me as a child. After reading the book about mind control, by <a href="http://www.emhdf.com/Monarch-mind-control.pdf" target="_blank">Fritz Springmeier &amp; Cisco Wheeler</a>, I learned about the use of mirrors in mind control, it just seems to have been done differently in my case.</p>
<p>By the time I entered my teens, I became a rebel and got into the punk music scene, which only fueled the fire, so to speak. While I was never a racist, I did end up doing some very negative things, but I never committed murder. I was involved in some ugly behaviors with friends though, such as playing around in graveyards. The lack of a father figure left me easily influenced by boyfriends, throughout my life. Since my mother was never around when I was growing up, and when she was, she mostly gave negative feedback, I had very little encouragement, causing me to be lonely and angry. I felt bullied by her for the most part. She gave very little love, and just seemed to want to spend all her time with her friends. She was an avid bowler (see the image of the 4<sup>th</sup> trump of the Thoth deck above), and would drag me to smoke-filled bowling alleys. She smoked 3 packs of cigarettes a day throughout my infancy and childhood, keeping a smoke-filled home &amp; car, which not only gave me asthma, but also a nicotine addiction. Instead of trying to reason with me, my mother would yell at me for bad behavior, with the following recurring theme: “You are stupid, stupid, stupid, and you’re never going to amount to anything!”, among other similar negative feedback patterns, which is, of course, more PSYOPS (as if the mirrors weren&#8217;t enough).</p>
<p>I have forgiven my parents for what they did because I know they must be victims of their own programming, or were coerced into adopting me and leaving me alone throughout most of my childhood, possibly as part of the experiment. My parents may have been unwitting participants in the scheme that I have witnessed occurring in my life, being victims of their own upbringing, so I have forgiven them, but I cannot forget the fact that neither of my parents were around much when I was growing up, which caused me to be quite emotionally needy, a quality that helped to destroy my life before I ever had a chance. <strong>There are many children who have suffered through similar divorce effects in their lives, however, the implants, the mirrors, the near-drowning at 3y/o, the adoption, and the symbolism I have referenced are simply too much for me to chalk up to a &#8220;child of divorce syndrome&#8221;.</strong></p>
<p>Although I might’ve been guilty of taking a few dollars from my mother here and there, during my teen years, I never stole large amounts of cash from her. When I was 17 years old, however, I got accused of stealing her wallet, which had $800 cash and her credit cards. While I know I did not do this because I fell asleep and woke up on the phone with my boyfriend at the time, she allowed the police to take me in for questioning, who then coerced me into a false confession. I don’t know if the police just wanted a scapegoat, or if this was a part of PSYOPS done on me to make me fear police and other officials so I would be afraid to go to them for help. It also made me more of a rebel. This event helped to ruin my relationship with my mother.</p>
<p>When I began to have memories resurface about mistreatment in my life, I became a target for what is known as <strong>PSYOPS</strong>, <strong>COINTELPRO</strong>, and <strong>Electronic Harassment</strong>. I began to hear voices through the implants on my head, done in order to discredit me. At first, they sent me positive messages, making me feel loved and cared for, but this soon turned to horrible and cruel words, designed to make me very sad and negative. Any professional I see wants to make me out to be schizophrenic, but won’t even do me the courtesy of getting these things on my head examined by a medical doctor. This tells me they are either in denial or are criminally negligent.</p>
<p>My mother was involved in a class action lawsuit against the tobacco companies which was won back in 2008 (or so my brother told me). My mother has passed away, and during the height of my breakdown involving the voices coming through my implants, and while I was living in that foreclosed house without water or power, my brother got me to sign over executorship of my mother’s estate. This leads me to believe that something fishy is going on. If anyone cares, please say a prayer for me. While me standing to inherent a large sum of money that a particular tobacco company might not want to pay could be one reason for my targeting, the implants in my ears lead me to believe this has been going on since my early childhood.</p>
<p>As noted, there may be more to this document to come, but I wanted to get it out before I die, or am imprisoned for some crime I haven’t committed. I fear this might be done in order to silence me.</p>

Some say aliens are responsible. Some people say it is demonic in nature &amp; accepting Jesus Christ as your personal savior is the only way to find relief. Some say this phenomena is &#8220;<strong>cause stalking</strong>&#8221; by a group of people who have <strong>judged</strong> the victim<strong> in absentia</strong>. Even still, there are those people, like some bloggers, who say it is something like &#8220;a godlike entity manipulating humanity&#8221;. I even read where one blogger overheard his handlers referring to him as &#8220;<strong>the sacrifice</strong>&#8220;.</p>
<p>As a victim of this, it becomes very difficult to know what the actual truth is. I am harassed with voices, directed conversation, pain, some sort of radiation hits in the chest, crotch, head, to the point where I honestly don&#8217;t understand what is happening. I am not alone in this, as I have read &amp; seen many other victims of this horrendous crime speak out about the exact same things. One begins to wonder if God is really a cruel entity allowing these things to go on, or worse, causing them, which is something I really <em>don&#8217;t want</em> to believe. If I am wrong about this, then I beg forgiveness, but I am confused about this issue.</p>

In my case, however, the very visible &amp; obvious <strong>implants</strong> in my ears make it all to clear that someone has been controlling me throughout my life. Since it is well-known that <strong>Dr. Jose Delgado</strong> was doing his research into <strong>brain stimulation</strong> with implants back in the 1950s &amp; for at least 20 years, it is not hard to imagine that I might&#8217;ve been sold into this &#8220;<strong>program</strong>&#8221; as a baby, through adoption. I have noticed that there is a predominance of adoptees &amp; foster kids who are victims, who blog &amp; vlog about this horrible situation. This is telling.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m so sorry for those who are suffering through this. <em>No one deserves it</em>, especially when you consider the overarching problem at the root of all of this. The problem that I see is that mind control has been happening on some level, for centuries at least. Mind control, by definition, <em>removes</em> freewill, &amp; there are many ways in which mind control is used to subtly influence people. The <strong>flicker rate</strong> of tv &amp; movies alone is enough to hypnotize people, especially children. Any <strong>subliminal messages</strong> in movies or television, such as hidden <strong>symbolism</strong>, access the <strong>subconscious mind</strong> directly, especially while people are in a <strong>trance</strong>. It is the manipulation of the human mind, which again, removes freewill.</p>
<p>It does seem that <strong>trauma</strong> plays a role in how much of an impact mind control has on an individual. It is now professionally recognized that adoption is a trauma for the baby, so it stands to reason that being placed in foster care, or any separation of a child from it&#8217;s natural parents would then also be traumatic. What about other traumas that occur in infancy &amp; early childhood? Like the near drowning at 3 years old, cited by so many ritual abuse victims? How about circumcision at birth? What about the onslaught of tests, immunizations, goo in the eyes, separation from mother, endured by most newborns born in hospitals? Could it be that these early traumas have a purpose beyond what is stated regarding the reasons for what is cited above?</p>

We were totally <strong>brainwashed</strong>. I can only imagine how many veterans (who were programed to be heroes, via TV &amp; movies) are now being mentally harassed, blamed for everything they might&#8217;ve done during wartime. I say this because I know that I am constantly blamed for things in my past, even though it is clear that <em>I never truly had freewill</em> in my life, do to the many ways in which I was affected by mind control.</p>
<p><strong>I have observed multiple ways a &#8220;system&#8221; can exert mind control over it&#8217;s population:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1) Religion</strong>&#8211; Religion has a long history of being used to control the masses. Children are brought up in a religion &amp; know nothing else. Most of these religions are pagan in origin, but vehemently deny that fact, &amp; then carry on with obvious pagan traditions. This would naturally cause a conflict in a child&#8217;s mind. The bible warns that &#8220;Christians would be persecuted in the so-called &#8220;end times&#8221;. Is it a coincidence that I know a fellow TI who&#8217;s name is &#8220;Christian&#8221;? I doubt it.</p>
<p><strong>2) Education</strong>&#8211; The educational system in the US especially, has a specific slanted point of view. If a child does not internalize this point of view, they end up with poor grades &amp; labeled as losers.</p>
<p><strong>3) Parenting</strong>&#8211; Parents have a specific point of view &amp; want their children at least to understand it, but some parents enforce their point of view on their children. But worse than this is the fact that some parents simply leave their kids alone most of the time, only giving negative attention to them. This is a form of <em>negative programming</em>.</p>
<p><strong>4) Media (TV, movies, music, talk radio, etc.)-</strong> Growing up with the mass media, I can attest to the fact that it shaped my beliefs, especially since I had negative programming from my own parents, &amp; was mostly left alone by them. Television was my primary baby sitter. There are subliminals in movies &amp; television to be sure, but also in music. Some messages are in the form of cleverly hidden artwork or backwards masking, but others can be found in the themes, which get repeated over &amp; over in multiple movies &amp; stories viewed by adults &amp; children alike. As I&#8217;ve seen others point out, there is a reason why they call it &#8220;television programming&#8221;. There are those who will vehemently deny that subliminal programming exists, even when it is right in your face (see <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmMnnOr-lYQ"><br /> Subliminal Sex Messages and Pornography in Advertising and Cartoons </a>). However, the flicker rate of television &amp; movies alone is enough to put people in a trance, especially when in front of the big-screen. Ever notice how large tv screens are these days? And why all that push for people to get HDTV even to the point of giving away free converters to people? Ever since that happened, it sure seems like things changed really quickly. It is like Orwell&#8217;s <strong>1984</strong>, just a little bit different.</p>
<p><strong>5) Language</strong>&#8211; If you take a good, hard look at the English language, you will find negative root words in many other words &amp; proper names. I have a video on this, called <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMe5Y4Hs_7c">&#8220;Mind Control Using Symbolism in Language and Numbers&#8221;</a>. A couple of examples though: how many words can you find with the root words mar, war, ill, or ow in them? This attests to how society, which learns language very young, is controlled by a very negative base program. There is this symbolism inherent in our language, some of it is visual (reading), while some of it is phonetic (hearing). You might consider your own name &amp; how you might&#8217;ve been treated by others throughout your life based on it.</p>
<p><strong>6) Controlled Opposition Groups</strong>&#8211; These are groups formed with the specific intent of controlling any opposition to the &#8220;system&#8221; (i.e. cult-ure or society). They are often, but not exclusively, from other countries, coming over to the US to alert people to the existence of mind control. Then, when people begin to wake up, they are targeted by the system that wants to defend its existence. They use mind control techniques such as NLP (neuro-linguistic programming) to give them a powerful influence on people.</p>
<p><strong>7)</strong> <strong>Occult Practices</strong>&#8211; Mind Control has been going on at least since the Pharos in Egypt, but more likely, it goes back to the Druids. They&#8217;ve been using drugs &amp; hypnotism for centuries, possibly much longer, and believe it or not, black magic &amp; voodoo are also involved. They are pushing forth an intent to influence individuals &amp; society as a whole, using <strong>meta-physical technologies</strong>, the knowledge of which has been passed down through their generations, the result of which has effects on the spirit of a person. Psyche comes from a Greek word referring to the spirit. Knowing the psychology of human beings allows for a greater influence over them.</p>
<p><strong>8)</strong> <strong>Implants &amp; Other Physical Technologies</strong>&#8211; When I consider the work of Nazi scientists &amp; the fact that the US brought them to this country under &#8220;<strong>Project Paperclip</strong>&#8221; to continue their experiments, it becomes extremely difficult for me to ignore the possibility that people are actually sold into programs of mind control experimentation, sometimes by their own parents. Technologies such as brain implants (see Dr. Jose Delgado&#8217;s work in the 1950s &amp; 60s), are used to completely wreck a person&#8217;s life or to enhance it.</p>
<p>The positive implications for mind control make it absolutely disgusting that they are using it to influence so many people in such negative ways. I mean, they could use it to help people quit smoking, for example, or to make people more successful &amp; therefore allow them to make better contributions to the world. So, why wouldn&#8217;t they?</p>
<p>It is my theory that those who are responsible for the most intense aspects of mind control, such as implants, do actually use<img data-attachment-id="924" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/07/04/mind-control-and-the-targeted-individual/goldendawn/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/goldendawn.jpg" data-orig-size="200,282" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="goldendawn" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/goldendawn.jpg?w=200" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/goldendawn.jpg?w=200" class="alignright  wp-image-924" alt="goldendawn" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/goldendawn.jpg?w=128&#038;h=181" width="128" height="181" srcset="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/goldendawn.jpg?w=128&amp;h=181 128w, https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/goldendawn.jpg?w=106&amp;h=150 106w, https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/goldendawn.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 128px) 100vw, 128px" /> it for positive purposes, but only on pre-designated people (i.e. the ones they can control the most), while for others (the ones they deem as the &#8220;losers&#8221;), it is used to keep that class of people down. It seems that they are keeping a balance by doing this: one group is brought to new heights, while the other is brought to extreme lows.</p>

The hexagram is prominently displayed in the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, &amp; it is also used in Theosophy. Both of these organizations, among others, are so-called &#8220;Secret Societies&#8221;, who, like the Freemasons, allow only those at the very top of the hierarchy to know the full truth of their methods &amp; practices, and what their role is in society at large. The hexagram is only one example of a <em>meta-physical technology</em>.</p>
<p>Those who are TIs are suffering as a result of being put at the pinnacle of an upside-down triangle, while their &#8220;chosen ones&#8221; are placed at the top.</p>
<p>It is also my theory that the ones who are held down, throughout their lives are then used for the creative inspiration that naturally comes from this sort of <strong>oppression</strong>. This inspiration gleaned from victims ultimately shows up in TV, movies, &amp; music, which means that there is a whole class of people benefitting from another class&#8217; suffering. It is an unspoken, unacknowledged form of <strong>slavery</strong> that can only result in emotional issues for the <strong>unwitting victims</strong>. These issues would then cause the victim to act out in a variety of ways, throughout their lives, since on some subconscious level, they probably know that they have been <strong>covertly enslaved</strong>.</p>
<p>This makes the <strong>TI</strong> the ultimate <strong>muse</strong> for an elitist system that sees people as mere &#8220;<strong>human resources</strong>&#8221; to be &#8220;utilized&#8221;. Trying to get any compensation or justice for what has been done to them, simply makes them look &#8220;crazy&#8221; or schizophrenic to those who don&#8217;t understand such a thing. However, part of me wonders if maybe everyone around the victim is well <img data-attachment-id="755" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/01/28/mcusingarchetypaltransference/justiceblind/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/justiceblind.jpg" data-orig-size="106,160" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="justiceblind" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/justiceblind.jpg?w=106" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/justiceblind.jpg?w=106" class="alignright size-full wp-image-755" alt="justiceblind" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/justiceblind.jpg?w=540"   />aware of the nightmare going on in front of their faces &amp; simply refuse to acknowledge it, lest the victim have a foothold into getting any justice for what has been done. There is a reason why &#8220;<strong>justice is blind</strong>&#8221; is a well-known phrase in this world, &amp; it has absolutely nothing to do with impartiality.</p>
<p>I am pretty sure that the idea of justice is now nothing more than a simulacrum of the original concept.</p>
<p>In my own situation, it seems that my whole life has been orchestrated, unbeknownst to me until more recently. I only just began to wake up to the situation in 2008, which is, coincidentally, the same year that I discovered I had implants in each ear. Symbolically &amp; psychologically, my life seems to have been completely manipulated to make me negative, sad, confused, depressed, &amp; apathetic. I have even seen how some of the more &#8220;metaphysical&#8221; technologies affected my adoptive mother&#8217;s life.</p>
<p>Some people would call what is happening to Targeted Individuals an affliction, but I would call it an <em>infliction</em> because it is inflicted on us by some other entity or entities.</p>
<p>When you present obvious evidence &amp; people don&#8217;t believe you, it can be extremely frustrating. Many of the same people who admit that the powers that be are using symbolism to manipulate human beings, will then deny the possibility that a person has been manipulated in this way. Many people who admit that there is all sorts of technology being used against people will then deny that implants exist, even though Dr. Delgado&#8217;s work in brain stimulation is well-known. This seems to be by design &amp; with the intent of driving the victim mad.</p>
<p>This will result in further discrediting the victim, who has most likely already had a smear campaign done against them. Those involved in these kinds of <strong>psyops</strong> (psychological operations), with the intent of destroying the victim&#8217;s life, credibility, sanity, and health, really deserve to be cursed to live the life they are consigning victims to.</p>

<p>“Some children live in foster homes, or with adopted parents, or in orphanages, or with caretakers and guardians. Because these children are at the mercy of the non-related adults, these types of children frequently are sold to become mind-controlled slaves of the intelligence agencies. In review, remember that because many of these organizations are controlled by the Illuminati; an Illuminati slave may often work for one of these front groups, while the Illuminati maintain control over the base-program.”</p>

<p>I am posting this because I have heard so many people doubt the fact that I have <strong>implants</strong> in my head. They say, “why would anybody want to do that?” and “what makes you so special”, or “why you?”</p>
<p>I assure you, it is not because I am special. In fact, I am anything but. I am just another <strong>adoptee</strong> used in a horrible, nightmarish <strong>human experiment</strong>. They don’t use so-called “special people” for what they have done to me. Rather, they use those they consider “expendable”. Well, when you see the segment above from the book, and you know that I was adopted through an agency that was recently indicted on <strong>child trafficking</strong> charges (Catholic Charities), it is less of a stretch to see why someone would implant an adoptee for such an experiment as is common in many mind control programs.</p>
<p><strong>Update 12/14/2012 regarding 12/12 correction (Thank you, MJ!):</strong></p>
<p>&#8220;300,000 babies stolen from their parents &#8211; and sold for adoption: Haunting BBC documentary exposes 50-year scandal of baby trafficking by the Catholic church in Spain&#8221;:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2049647/BBC-documentary-exposes-50-year-scandal-baby-trafficking-Catholic-church-Spain.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2049647/BBC-documentary-exposes-50-year-scandal-baby-trafficking-Catholic-church-Spain.html</a></p>
<p>Correction, edited on 12/12/2012:</p>
<p>I rescind the statement above, regarding Cahtholic Charities, because I can no longer find the article where I saw that they were indicted, although I did see it in a news story on television. Since I cannot back up the claim with any proof, I cannot make the claim. While I haven&#8217;t found anything on Catholic Charities, specifically, it is no stretch of the imagination to think of the possibility, considering the article linked above.</p>
<p>The adoption scandal in Haiti, I have learned, involved a group of Baptists.</p>
<p>That being said, most people who have done any research on children who are used in experiments are frequently from orphanages. It also must be noted that many targeted individuals that I know are adopted or were in foster homes.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_international_adoption_scandals">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_international_adoption_scandals</a></p>
<p>The fact that the CIA was implanting animals with these devices to control and monitor them only two years before I was born, and the fact that man&#8217;s inhumanity towards man is becoming more and more overt these days, it becomes increasingly clear to me that, to those in power, nothing is sacred.</p>
<p>It seems that they get to everyone who might possibly help me. I have implants in my head for cryin’ outloud! Am I really living in such a disgusting world, where those in power are able to break their own laws and the Geneva Convention by implanting an infant with <strong>RFID</strong>s that allow these rotten scumbags to get away with destroying a soul before it even has a chance? Where is the humanity? Where are the decent human beings in this world?</p>
<p>Oh yeah, that’s right, only scum rises to the top these days.</p>
<p>When the book about <strong>mind control</strong> I referenced above was first put out, there might have been some hope for me, but these days, psychologists and psychiatrists have become part of the problem, refusing to acknowledge that mind control and <strong>ritual abuse</strong> even exist. It is truly a sad state of affairs when people are made disabled on purpose to fulfill some sick plan for a dystopian society.</p>
<p>If there is a God, I pray that God sees the whole truth and stops these evil beings from interfering with individual freewill. I am tired of being a <strong>human guinea pig</strong>.</p>
<p>Here is a horrible quote that demonstrates what these power tripping brain brokers are up to: &#8220;We need a programme of psychosurgery for political control of our society. The purpose is physical control of the mind. Everyone who deviates from the given norm can be surgically mutilated. The individual may think that the most important reality is his own existence, but this is only his personal point of view. This lacks historical perspective. Man does not have the right to develop his own mind. This kind of liberal orientation has great appeal. We must electrically control the brain. Some day armies and generals will be controlled by electric stimulation of the brain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8211;Dr. Jose Delgado, February 24, 1974 edition of the Congressional Record, No. 262E, Vol. 118</p>
<p>(The above quote was actually a compilation of statements from Delgado&#8217;s various publications, which were accurately cited in an article by Dr. Peter R. Breggins, &#8220;The Return of Lobotomy and Psychosurgery.&#8221; It was this article that was presented to Congress on 24 February 1972. <a href="http://cabinetmagazine.org/issues/2/psychcivilization.php">http://cabinetmagazine.org/issues/2/psychcivilization.php</a>)</p>
<p>Over the past few years, their experimentation on me has gotten completely out of hand. I am now the victim of <strong>electronic harassment</strong> (which seems to me to be a euphimism for <strong>electromagnetic torture</strong>). I am in constant pain and the implants that were once used for subliminal messaging are now overt and cruel hate speech and slander of me.

<p>I am writing this to say that if, all of a sudden, I am no longer posting blogs, it is because I have become too vocal about what was done to me (RFID implants and an occult curse involving the tarot). The proof of what was done to me is visible and palpable, and is right on my head, in front of each ear. They are the exact size of RFID implants. Those who deny these are implants are either lying or in denial themselves. I have been a human guinea pig for far too long to deny that I am a victim of mind control and ritual abuse. Please see the following document for more info on the particulars of my case, and photo proof of my implants:</p>
<p><a href="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2012/10/06/how-my-case-differs-from-wellknown-mind-control-cases/">https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2012/10/06/how-my-case-differs-from-wellknown-mind-control-cases/</a></p>
<p>I am concerned that I am might get framed for something I have not done. I say this because I am currently harassed and gang stalked and threatened that they are going to do this to me. I have heard them say they want no witnesses. I am one such witness. Over my lifetime, I have been mind controlled by some very nefarious forces that have been unseen by me. Using the implants that could&#8217;ve only been put there when I was an infant, in custody of the agency for the first 6 weeks of my life, my mind has been manipulated in ways to make me emotionally unwell, which as they knew, would wind up making me addicted to illegal drugs, which could then be used to discredit me. This has been done in addition to putting me in a family that was either paid to berate me verbally and leave me mostly alone, or they just did it naturally. I have notied in the document above that I spent half my childhood in a literal &#8220;house of mirrors&#8221;, which would have obvious effects on a young personality.</p>
<p>While I am proud to say I am no longer addicted to illegal drugs, I am sorry to say that I now have a past that haunts me. This was by design. This is a part of the whole &#8220;problem-reaction-solution&#8221; blueprint whereby they cause the problem, seeking a reaction, so they can offer a solution they already have in mind, which in my case is killing me. So they have used gang-stalking techniques to turn neighbor against neighbor by telling lies and half-truths. This is done on the small scale, but also on the larger scale, within the so-called &#8220;truth movement&#8221;, as I have sadly noticed over the past four years.</p>
<p>Those in power have been in power for a very long time. They have been in power since long before you or I were ever born, so it behooves me to state that all of history has been written, and is deposed to students by what I can only call &#8220;the system&#8221;. It is not in that system&#8217;s interest to allow those who really do espouse truth to exist, so they put out fake &#8220;truthers&#8221; online to disseminate disinfo and pit TIs against one another.</p>
<p>I say this because I have had my character assasinated, lost my job, and my whole life has been ruined because I began to discover the truth of what was done to me. I did not consent to be the subject of human experimentation when I was born and sold into slavery via my adoption through Catholic Charities (an agency that has been indicted on child-trafficking charges not too long ago). This is why I have become a victim of what is being called &#8220;soft-kill&#8221;, &#8220;slow-kill&#8221;, and &#8220;no-touch torture&#8221;. I am exhibiting all the symptoms of what is described here: <a href="http://targetedindividualscanada.wordpress.com/2011/03/30/direct-energy-weapons-2/">http://targetedindividualscanada.wordpress.com/2011/03/30/direct-energy-weapons-2/</a></p>
<p>Sadly, I am reminded of a song by the band called &#8220;Muse&#8221;, called &#8220;MK Ultra&#8221;, during which the singer says, &#8220;All of history deleted with one stroke&#8221;. I have noticed how things are being changed online. Facts that used to state one thing are now being changed, or the online documents and websites no longer exist. I have noted in my online dodument called &#8220;The Case for the Left&#8221;, that studies in stroke victims show how one hemisphere of the brain controls the opposite side of the body. I have noticed how newer documents say this isn&#8217;t true, yet it cannot be denied that a stroke in the right hemisphere of the brain always affects something on the left side of the body. Does this fact not tell us that the original assumption is true, and that the right hemisphere generally <em>does</em> control the left side of the body? Yet I have been unable to find a psychologist who can agre with this idea.</p>
<p>One thing I want to note before I end this post is that not many TIs who accept the existence of electronic harassment and direct energy weapons is willing to notice that those in power are adepts in the occult. I say this because many people who can see that I am a target don&#8217;t want to see how an occult curse has affected my life. If they know about how Nazi scientists have been used in mind control, in America, then they only need to do a little research to se how the Nazis were involved in the occult. Considering how these Nazi scientists have been used for Monarch and MK Ultra, it is not such a leap to consider that those involved in mind control use witchcraft and satanism to further their goals. In fact, one look at Fritz Springmeier&#8217;s work will clarify this. For an interview with this man, see this link: <a href="http://targetedindividualscanada.wordpress.com/?s=fritz+springmeier">http://targetedindividualscanada.wordpress.com/?s=fritz+springmeier</a></p>
<p>I am grateful to the &#8220;targeted individuals canada&#8221; wordpress site for all of their information. It lets me know that I am not crazy.</p>
<p>For more information on the occult and symbolic side of what&#8217;s going on, please see this link: <a href="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2012/09/11/symbolism-mind-control-and-metaphysical-sabotage-in-relation-to-archetypal-transference-and-the-second-commandment-of-the-decalogue">https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2012/09/11/symbolism-mind-control-and-metaphysical-sabotage-in-relation-to-archetypal-transference-and-the-second-commandment-of-the-decalogue</a></p>
<p>By the way, much of what is happening to targets all over the world, including mind control, is seen in movies, music, and television, but in music, especially. Some songs that relate to my case are:</p>
<p>Believe it or not, there is a rap artist called &#8220;TI&#8221;.</p>
<p>Kate Bush &#8211; Experiment IV (she sings, &#8220;they told us what they wanted was a sound that could kill someone from a distance&#8221;)</p>
<p>Depeche Mode &#8211; Wrong (especially the video-relates to the effects of the tarot curse), Precious</p>
<p>Muse &#8211; MK Ultra, Stockholm Syndrome, Unnatural Selection</p>

<p><b>11/2/2012</b></p>
<p>Just heard a voice say, “We can’t protect you anymore”. I am forced to wonder what in the world the voice was referring to, because over the past four years I have been tortured physically via what they are calling “<b>soft kill</b>” and “<b>slow kill</b>”, as well as <b>electronic harassment</b>, and voices coming through these implants in front of each of my ears. I am wondering when I was being protected anyway. Was it when I was born and sold into slavery through a Catholic agency that has been indicted on child-trafficking charges? Maybe I was being ‘protected’  when I was implanted with these <b>RFID chips</b> in my ears, used to influence my <b>psyche,</b> and ruin my spirit, throughout my life (proof of implants at: <a href="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2012/07/16/implantvictim">https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2012/07/16/implantvictim</a>)</p>
<p>Was it when my mother was telling me to “eat shit and die”? Was it when she left me alone in the crib to scream and cry until I passed out from exhaustion? How about when I was drowned at 3 years old? Perhaps the voice was referring to when I was exposed to my mother smoking 3 packs a day in front of my face, or when she used to drag me to smoke-filled bowling alleys for years. Maybe I was protected when I was left alone to raise myself through most of my childhood. Could it be that I was being protected when I was being called stupid every other day by my mom? Was I being protected when my brother wrapped me up in that blanket and tossed me down the stairs, when I was around 5 years old? Was I being protected when I was raped at 16 by a 21 year old man? How about when I was trying to get treated for a chronic stomach ache and the doctor decided to give me a pelvic exam, leaving the speculum in for 45 minutes while he took off (when he finally finished the exam about an hour after it started, he asked me, “Are we still friends?”), to go to lunch? Was I being protected then?</p>
<p>So when were these so-called protectors actually protecting me anyway?</p>
<p>I know it couldn’t have been very recent, because I have been suffering more lately than I ever have in my life. In fact, what is happening to me feels like a slow type of <b>murder</b>.</p>
<p>I am in constant physical pain in my privates, while I am now suffering from attacks of induced <b>heart palpitations</b>, burning in localized areas of my body, and severe itching to the point of me breaking the skin from scratching so much. Sometimes, I get the sensation that the wind has been knocked out of me. I have even had localized pain in my back, going straight through into my chest and lung. These are all symptoms commonly associated with <b>microwave</b> and <b>electromagnetic radiation</b>, judging from what I have read online.</p>
<p>So again, I must ask, what exactly was I being protected from? What happens now is anyone’s guess.</p>
<p>The fact that my nickname online, musicis2words, represents the words <b>mu</b> as the “12<sup>th</sup> letter of the Greek alphabet”, and the word <b>sic</b> meaning “as intentionally so written”, and the fact that I have recently seen a youtuber who calls himself, “ignoramusky” (ignore-a-mu-ski), tells me that there is some serious <b>cointelpro</b> going on in my case. I am disgusted by it and those who are willing to torture people simply because we are some part of a sick and disgusting experiment of death and destruction.</p>
<p>Please, what do they want from me? If any <b>perpetrator</b> is reading this, please tell me what you want from me? I mean, since I keep getting blamed for being the cause of what has been happening to me throughout my life, I have to ask, “what is it I could do differently to stop you people from murdering me?”</p>
