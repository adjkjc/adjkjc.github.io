<p>If you are familiar with concepts such as: “<b>the butterfly effect</b>”, from “<b>chaos theory</b>”, and “<b>the law of attraction</b>”, and/or you understand the ideas behind <a href="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/chaostheory.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="753" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/01/28/mcusingarchetypaltransference/chaostheory/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/chaostheory.jpg" data-orig-size="160,89" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="chaostheory" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/chaostheory.jpg?w=160" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/chaostheory.jpg?w=160" class="size-full wp-image-753 alignright" alt="chaostheory" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/chaostheory.jpg?w=540" srcset="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/chaostheory.jpg 160w, https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/chaostheory.jpg?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 160px) 100vw, 160px"   /></a>movies such as “<b>The Secret</b>”, and “<b>What the Bleep Do We Know</b>?” (which talks a bit about <b>Quantum Mechanics</b>), then I feel you may have a better understanding of how I came to the following theory, which is based on my observations, research, and personal experience. While there are many different forms of mind control programming, including, but not limited to, movies, music, tell-a-vision, the use of implants, and even the manipulation of language (which I have discussed in another document), this paper will focus on the astrological and tarot archetypes and their impact on the human <b>psyche</b>. Keep in mind that the word “psyche” comes from a Greek word for “spirit”, thus mind control does indeed affect the spirit.</p>
<p>In this document, I refer to a concept known as <b>archetypal transference </b>as a form of metaphysical programming because it seems to act on a metaphysical level, as opposed to programming through movies and such, which occur on a physical level, although both forms of programming ultimately affect the psyche. Psychiatrist Carl Gustave Jung described archetypes as “models of people, behaviors or personalities” that exist “in the collective unconscious” (1). Transference is the projection of unconscious contents. I am using the term, “archetypal transference”, to refer to the process by which tarot and astrological archetypes are inserted into the collective unconscious, and are then projected onto people based on their numerology and birthdates. Jung referred to cultural archetypes that I see as natural (hero, lover, caregiver , etc.), whereas I am referring to archetypes that I see as unnatural and imposed on people based on their birthdates, and on the collective unconscious through the so-called “disciplines” of tarot and astrology, and their overuse in popular culture.</p>
<p>For those of you who are not familiar with these concepts, there are some references and definitions with links (for further research), at the bottom of this paper. However, I ask you to please read through this document before following the links and getting lost on the internet. 🙂</p>
<p>There is a set of <b>archetypes</b>, in<b> tarot</b> and <b>astrology</b>, which seem to be a type of <b>metaphysical mind control</b>. It is done on a level that is less detectable than the more commonly known forms of mind control, since these particular archetypes have been around for centuries, in the case of tarot (1), and for millennia, in the case of astrology (2). While these archetypes may be hard for some to recognize, regarding how they relate to the “butterfly effect”, please bear with me. These archetypes refer to the “butterfly effect” in that they are initial conditions existing in the collective unconscious that have specific results. Since they have been around for so long, much longer than you or I have been alive, they have become <strong>memes</strong>. One begins to wonder if these archetypes were made to illustrate an existing pattern, if they were made to influence people’s natures  in an unnatural way, or if it’s a little of both. Even if they were created innocently (without a negative intent), I still do feel they have an impact on the collective psyche of humanity, with regards to <b>freewill</b>.</p>
<p><b>My Theory is based on Research, Observation, and Personal Experience:</b></p>
<p>The way “law of attraction” is supposed to work is that, focusing on or repeating a certain idea or desire will bring that idea or desire to fruition. The “butterfly effect” refers to the idea that something seemingly small can have a big impact on something else, for example, that a butterfly flapping its wings in Japan could cause a hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean. Both of these theories, which seem to have some validity, combine to make a big mess where the archetypes of <b>tarot</b> and <b>astrology</b> are concerned. These <b>archetypes</b> are assigned to people based on their birthdates, and also sometimes based on numerology, and thus become the “initial conditions” referred to in the “butterfly effect” (see definition below). There are over 1,200 decks of tarot cards in circulation today (3), and they have been printed and reprinted an untold number of times, which, according to the law of attraction, amplifies the vibration of those archetypes. In the meantime, more and more people have been studying these two disciplines in the past 50 years especially, and/or have been getting readings done for them by other people. As more people are exposed to these archetypes, the <b>collective unconscious</b> is increasingly affected by them, in the form of <b>memes</b>. It is the repetition of a pattern that amplifies its vibration, and produces results specific to that pattern. With all these decks out there, and all their subsequent printings, these energies are amplified.</p>
<p>The only way to bring any true freewill back into this world is to abolish the archetypes. I do not say this lightly. By tying someone’s birthdate to the astrology signs and tarot correspondences, freewill is severely restricted, causing people to <i>generally</i> behave in predetermined ways, based on these archetypes. So with astrology, we end up with scorpios being passionate, but also kind of mean, virgos being intelligent and analytical, but sometimes over-critical, aries being assertive, but sometimes pushy, and leos being glamorous, hogs for attention.</p>
<p>The fact that most people in our society seem to fit most of the main character traits for their star signs, whether they believe in astrology or not, shows that these archetypes have been inserted into the collective unconscious, in the form of memes, via archetypal transference, and unbeknownst to the individual. This removes a measure of freewill, causing people to be stuck in cookie cutter personality traits and life patterns.  Astrology has been around for millennia, and has had its impact accordingly. The tarot has only been around for centuries, but has become so popular in recent decades, that it seems to have caused the collective unconscious to become infected with these memes, which are a whole different set of predetermined archetypes. This then further restricts freewill, again based on one’s birthdate.</p>

For example, my mother was born on 4/4, her corresponding trump card was the Emperor, and she displayed the characteristics of the 4<sup>th</sup> trump, most notably from the so-called, Crowley-Thoth deck. The symbols in that card represented the main characters in her life, one example being the two rams behind the seated figure, representing two aries who supported my mother during her life, my father on the left, and maternal grandmother (deceased) on the right. Aliester Crowley was a known Satanist, who is said to have also been an MI6 agent. Frieda Harris painted the deck under his instruction. Did he have an ulterior motive for this deck? Was he putting this energy out there on purpose to affect reality? When I saw this card, in relation to my mother’s 4/4 birthdate, and recognized the significance of that card’s symbols in her life, I began to wonder if my own life was influenced in a similar way, given my double digit birthdate.</p>
<p>Once I began to examine my own life in relation to the tarot, based on my having a 12/12 birthdate, I could not deny that the 12th trump archetype of <a href="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpthoth.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-221" style="width:125px;height:179px;" alt="12th Trump from the Thoth Tarot Deck" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpthoth.jpg?w=540" srcset="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpthoth.jpg 184w, https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpthoth.jpg?w=102 102w" sizes="(max-width: 184px) 100vw, 184px"   /></a>The Hanged Man, which is an upside-down/reversed figure, had a very significant impact on my development, <i>long before I ever knew the tarot or astrology even existed</i>. Also, please notice how there is an upside-down <b>ankh </b>in this card, which is the Egyptian hieroglyph for “life”. What might that imply? Given the idea of the butterfly effect of these cards being printed over and over again, what might that upside-down ankh ultimately influence in these years surrounding 2012, since it is on the 12<sup>th</sup> trump card? How would it influence the life of a human being, who is unknowingly tied to that card? Could these things have anything to do with how absurd things seem in our world lately with the gross violations of human rights that continues to be perpetrated on <b>nonconsensual human experimentees</b>, and on those who call themselves “<b>targeted individuals</b>”? Could the upside-down and reversed nature of this card have had anything to do with certain unjust things happening in our world today, such as the couple getting arrested for rescuing a baby deer (4)?</p>

So, not wanting to be evil, I endeavored to learn how to write with the right hand. Given the whole left-brain, right-brain concept, which possibly evolved from studies of stroke victims, showing that stroke in the right hemisphere of the brain affects something on the left side of the body, and vice a versa (but I digress), I contend that changing a human being’s natural handedness changes the natural balance in the child’s brain, further subverting freewill. I know of one person, who was born on 10/20 (which carries the 12 vibration &#8211; 1020), who was also made to write right-handed even though he was originally left-inclined. Is that a coincidence?</p>
<p>Both he and I are very creative people, (I was an artist and he a musician), yet we both lack the perseverance to be able to complete creative projects. If we had been allowed to be left-handed, would we have been more successful in our creative endeavors? It is a subject I would like to see investigated. Perhaps someone should do some studies on these people who were naturally left-handed, but made to be right-handed. Maybe one of those illustrious scientists could try that instead of experimenting with brain stimulation using implants which has messed up so many people’s lives, including my own.</p>
<p>This “reverse-curse”, brings us back to the concepts of the “butterfly effect” and “law of attraction”. Causing a “butterfly effect”, the repetition of these archetypes through multiple printings of over 1200 decks, creates a metaphysical effect on the <b>psyche</b>, which in turn, causes a person to emulate these archetypes in some capacity, thereby attracting attributes of their corresponding archetypes. In my case, astrologically, my archetype is Sagittarius, but also Ophiuchus, whose feet do lie on the ecliptic. Now take a look at the 12<sup>th</sup> trump of the Crowley-Harris Thoth deck and compare it to Ophiuchus. Notice any similarities?</p>

<p>In both cases, there is a <b>serpent</b>. It either represents the so-called “<b>serpent class</b>” or the devil himself. In the 12<sup>th</sup> trump, the serpent looks as if it is sucking from the brain of the subject, in the constellation of Ophiuchus, it seems that the subject is <a href="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/deadsnake.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="758" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/01/28/mcusingarchetypaltransference/deadsnake/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/deadsnake.jpg" data-orig-size="259,194" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="deadsnake" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/deadsnake.jpg?w=259" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/deadsnake.jpg?w=259" class="size-full wp-image-758 alignright" alt="deadsnake" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/deadsnake.jpg?w=540" srcset="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/deadsnake.jpg 259w, https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/deadsnake.jpg?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 259px) 100vw, 259px"   /></a>carrying the serpent.  Either way, I see the serpent in these archetypes as a <b>parasite</b>. Hence the background image currently on my YouTube page (shown to the right). I apologize if it looks gross, and I am not an animal killer. I actually really love animals in general. In fact, I feel bad for the snake in that picture. I was just looking for an image that represented how I feel about what has been going on for far too long, in my opinion. While we’re on the subject, why is one of the symbols for America the serpent (as in “Don’t tread on me”)? Could this have been done just to conflict with the Bible, and to cause unconscious confusion and/or <strong>cognitive dissonance </strong>among Americans who happen to be Christian? Hmmm….</p>
<p>Who created these archetypes, anyway? I suspect it was someone <b>playing God</b>. Even the word “archetype” contains “arch” in it, which would be above the head. I see these particular archetypes, which are associated with birthdates, as “<b>graven images</b>” (one could say they have been engraven into the collective unconscious). They have infected the collective unconscious, and have robbed a large measure of freewill from the individual, but have also, therefore robbed that individual of the person they were originally intended to be. Without the existence of these pre-fabricated, pre-appointed, archetypal molds that were put into place centuries and even millennia, before the individual was born, the child who was originally left-handed might have remained left-handed, and the effect on her or his life would have been what the Creator originally intended by making them left-handed in the first place. If you don’t believe in a Creator, then consider that nature also intended for those left-handed children to be left-handed for a reason.</p>
<p>When I take a look at my entire life, I can’t help but wonder if my archetype is an arche-“typo”. I wonder if it is a mistake or if it was done on purpose. It’s a cruel joke, to say the least. Please also consider watching my video about “<b>Symbolism in Words and Numbers</b>” to see more detail about mind control programming, done on such a foundational level. After learning about symbolism, it becomes more obvious that there is a malevolent modus operandi found within the nature of the English language.</p>

<p>Here is an example of an archetype not specific to tarot or astrology, although it is the 11<sup>th</sup> trump in certain, more traditional tarot decks: It is the archetype of justice. Frequently, justice is referred to as being blind. Why is that? Some people say it means that justice is impartial. Well, why not just say “justice is impartial”? Since I have heard and read that phrase, “justice is blind”, often throughout my life, I wonder who came up with that idea. Even most statues depicting this archetype are of a blindfolded woman holding the scales of justice. Justice should never be blind, in my opinion. Rather, it should be able to see all aspects of a situation before rendering judgment on an individual affected by these things. If you are a victim of monarch programming, or a nonconsensual human experimentee, like myself, then you may have noticed that it has been hard to get justice for your situation. If you’re not, you may instead have noticed how the laws in the United States (with the Patriot Act, for example) are changing in ways that seem to remove the original intent of the <b>Constitution</b>, and go directly against the Pledge of Allegiance, wh<a href="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/justiceblind.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="755" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/01/28/mcusingarchetypaltransference/justiceblind/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/justiceblind.jpg" data-orig-size="106,160" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="justiceblind" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/justiceblind.jpg?w=106" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/justiceblind.jpg?w=106" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-755" alt="justiceblind" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/justiceblind.jpg?w=540"   /></a>ich claims the United States of America is “one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all”.</p>
<p>Could this be a “butterfly effect” of the frequently repeated phrase, “<b>Justice is blind</b>”? I think it’s possible. Does the archetype of “blind justice” actually serve the human population? I don’t think it does. Rather, I think “blind justice” serves the criminals who have purposefully enslaved the human population through mind control programming, not only in movies, music, and tell-a-vision, but also through the manipulation of language and archetypes.</p>
<p>Programming via TV, movies, music, and language is done to people on a physical level, meaning that it creates effects on the human mind. However, the creation of these particular archetypes, I feel, was specifically to control people on a more metaphysical level, meaning it has effects on the human spirit, making it less detectable, and therefore more insidious, than those other forms of mind control. Basically, it is what I would call, “<b>archetypal determinism</b>”, done through the projection of specific archetypes assigned by birthdate and numerology, using “the butterfly effect” of over a thousand decks, and untold printings of each, which severely restricts freewill, on an unconscious and psychological level. The “puppet” then, cannot be held responsible for the actions of some unseen “puppet master” who creates and perpetuates these archetypes. That would be akin to “blaming the victim”, a mentality that seems to be occurring on a grand scale these days. The amplification of the vibrations of these archetypes through numerous printings of so many decks becomes nothing but another form of unseen slavery, making human beings into nothing more than metaphysical guinea pigs.</p>
<p>Ah, but we are told that slavery is illegal and doesn’t exist, right? You who are nonconsensual human experimentees might realize that idea as untrue. However, when you try to mention it, you are told you’re crazy. This is known as the <b>double-bind</b> and causes conflict in the psyche, including the manifestation of schizophrenic symptoms.</p>
<p>I would like to give special thanks to Michael Gaio for his article entitled, “Archetypal Semiotic Transference”, because it helped me to see how this stuff works, how it affected me before I ever knew the tarot and astrology existed, and how it affected my mother as well.

<p><b>Chaos theory</b> is the study of nonlinear dynamics, in which <i>seemingly random</i> events are actually predictable from simple deterministic equations.</p>
<p>-From <a href="http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/chaos-theory">http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/chaos-theory</a></p>
<p>Chaos theory studies the behavior of dynamical systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditions, an effect which is popularly referred to as the butterfly effect. Small differences in initial conditions (such as those due to rounding errors in numerical computation) yield widely diverging outcomes for such dynamical systems, rendering long-term prediction impossible in general.[1] This happens even though these systems are deterministic, meaning that their future behavior is fully determined by their initial conditions, with no random elements involved.[2] In other words, the deterministic nature of these systems does not make them predictable.</p>

<p><b>The Butterfly Effect</b> is first described by Lorenz at the December 1972 meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Washington, D.C., vividly illustrates the essential idea of chaos theory. In a 1963 paper for the New York Academy of Sciences, Lorenz had quoted an unnamed meteorologist&#8217;s assertion that, if chaos theory were true, a single flap of a single seagull&#8217;s wings would be enough to change the course of all future weather systems on the earth.</p>

<p><b>The Law of Attraction</b> refers to the idea that you attract that which you focus on. The movies, “The Secret”, and “What the Bleep Do We Know”, both refer to the Law of Attraction, although “What the Bleep Do We Know” digs more deeply into ideas of Quantum Physics as they relate to the “law of attraction”.

<p><b>Memes</b> The word meme is a shortening (modeled on gene) of mimeme (from Ancient Greek μίμημα Greek pronunciation: [míːmɛːma] mīmēma, &#8220;imitated thing&#8221;, from μιμεῖσθαι mimeisthai, &#8220;to imitate&#8221;, from μῖμος mimos &#8220;mime&#8221;) and it was coined by the British evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins in The Selfish Gene (1976) as a concept for discussion of evolutionary principles in explaining the spread of ideas and cultural phenomena. Examples of memes given in the book included melodies, catch-phrases, fashion and the technology of building arches.</p>

<p><b>Transference</b> is the projection of unconscious contents. Jung&#8217;s Studies in Word Association (1906) provided evidence for and referred to Freud&#8217;s concept of transference, published the previous year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     -From <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/transference-counter-transference-analytical-psychology">http://www.answers.com/topic/transference-counter-transference-analytical-psychology</a></p>
<p><b>Collective Consciousness</b> was a term coined by the French sociologist Émile Durkheim (1858–1917) to refer to the shared beliefs and moral attitudes which operate as a unifying force within society.[1]</p>
<p>-From <a href="http://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/collective+unconscious">http://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/collective+unconscious</a></p>
<p><b>Collective Unconscious</b> is a term of analytical psychology, coined by Carl Jung. It is proposed to be a part of the unconscious mind, expressed in humanity and all life forms with nervous systems, and describes how the structure of the psyche autonomously organizes experience. Jung distinguished the collective unconscious from the personal unconscious, in that the personal unconscious is a personal reservoir of experience unique to each individual, while the collective unconscious collects and organizes those personal experiences in a similar way with each member of a particular species.</p>
<p>For Jung, “My thesis then, is as follows: in addition to our immediate consciousness, which is of a thoroughly personal nature and which we believe to be the only empirical psyche (even if we tack on the personal unconscious as an appendix), there exists a second psychic system of a collective, universal, and impersonal nature which is identical in all individuals. This collective unconscious does not develop individually but is inherited. It consists of pre-existent forms, the archetypes, which can only become conscious secondarily and which give definite form to certain psychic contents.&#8221;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              -From <a href="http://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/Collective+consciousness">http://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/Collective+consciousness</a></p>
<p><b>Cognitive Dissonance</b> is a psychological phenomenon which refers to the discomfort felt at a discrepancy between what you already know or believe, and new information or interpretation. It therefore occurs when there is a need to accommodate new ideas, and it may be necessary for it to develop so that we become &#8220;open&#8221; to them. Neighbour (1992) makes the generation of appropriate dissonance into a major feature of tutorial (and other) teaching: he shows how to drive this kind of intellectual wedge between learners&#8217; current beliefs and &#8220;reality&#8221;.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      -From <a href="http://www.learningandteaching.info/learning/dissonance.htm">http://www.learningandteaching.info/learning/dissonance.htm</a></p>
<p>Two cognitions are said to be dissonant if one cognition follows from the opposite of another. What happens to people when they discover dissonant cognitions? The answer to this question forms the basic postulate of Festinger¹s theory. A person who has dissonant or discrepant cognitions is said to be in a state of psychological dissonance, which is experienced as unpleasant psychological tension. This tension state has drivelike properties that are much like those of hunger and thirst. When a person has been deprived of food for several hours, he/she experiences unpleasant tension and is driven to reduce the unpleasant tension state that results. Reducing the psychological sate of dissonance is not as simple as eating or drinking however.</p>
<p>To understand the alternatives open to an individual in a state of dissonance, we must first understand the factors that affect the magnitude of dissonance arousal. First, in its simplest form, dissonance increases as the degree of discrepancy among cognitions increases. Second, dissonance increases as the number of discrepant cognitions increases. Third, dissonance is inversely proportional to the number of consonant cognitions held by an individual. Fourth, the relative weights given to the consonant and dissonant cognitions may be adjusted by their importance in the mind of the individual.</p>
<p>-From <a href="http://www.ithaca.edu/faculty/stephens/cdback.html">http://www.ithaca.edu/faculty/stephens/cdback.html</a></p>
<p>Cognitive dissonance refers to a situation involving conflicting attitudes, beliefs or behaviors. This produces a feeling of discomfort leading to an alteration in one of the attitudes, beliefs or behaviors to reduce the discomfort and restore balance etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     -From <a href="http://www.simplypsychology.org/cognitive-dissonance.html">http://www.simplypsychology.org/cognitive-dissonance.html</a></p>
<p>I contend that cognitive dissonance can occur on both conscious and unconscious levels.</p>
<p><b>Double-bind:</b> Bateson et al. suggest that a person caught in a &#8220;double bind&#8221; &#8212; a situation in which no matter what a person does, he &#8220;can&#8217;t win&#8221; &#8212; may develop schizophrenic symptoms. In the double bind there are two conflicting levels of communication and an injunction against commenting on the conflict. –From <a href="http://laingsociety.org/cetera/pguillaume.htm">http://laingsociety.org/cetera/pguillaume.htm</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are familiar with concepts such as: “<b>the butterfly effect</b>”, “<b>chaos theory</b>”, &amp; “<b>the law of attraction</b>”, and/or you understand the ideas behind movies such as “<b>What the Bleep Do We Know</b>?” (which talks a bit about <b>Quantum Mechanics</b>), &amp; “<b>The Secret</b>”, then I feel you may have a better understanding of how I came to the following theory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>My Theory:</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The way “law of attraction” is supposed to work is that, focusing on or repeating a certain idea or desire will bring that idea or desire to fruition. The “butterfly effect” is the theory that something seemingly small can have a big impact on something else. Both of these theories combine to make a big mess where <b>tarot</b> and <b>astrology</b> archetypes are concerned. These <b>archetypes</b> have been printed and reprinted an uncountable number of times, which, according to the butterfly effect and law of attraction, amplifies the vibration of those archetypes. In the meantime, more and more people end up studying these two disciplines, or at least getting readings done for them by other people. Every day, more and more people are exposed to these archetypes, and, as they are, the collective consciousness is increasingly affected by them. It is the repetition of a pattern that amplifies its vibration, and produces results specific to that pattern.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only way to bring true goodness back into this world is to abolish the archetypes. I do not say this lightly. By tying someone’s birthdate to the astrology signs and tarot correspondences, freewill is severely restricted, causing people to generally behave in predetermined ways, based on these archetypes. So with astrology, we end up with scorpios being kind of mean, virgos being “know-it-all’s” (as I heard one virgo tell me), aries being rather hard-headed, and leos being hogs for attention. With the tarot, we end up with people born on double digits, displaying characteristics from various cards, but especially the trumps: for example, my mother was born on 4/4 and her corresponding trump card was the Emperor, and she displayed the characteristics of that card, and the symbolisms in that card were the main characters in her life. In my mother’s case the specific deck was the Crowley-Harris Thoth deck. Crowley was a known Satanist, who is said to have also been an MI6 agent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fact that most people in our society seem to fit most of the character traits of their star signs, whether they believe in astrology or not, means that these archetypes have been inserted into the collective consciousness, via <b>archetypal transference</b>, unbeknownst to the individual. This removes a measure of freewill, causing people to be stuck in cookie cutter personality traits and life patterns.  The fact that the tarot has become so popular in recent decades, has also caused the <b>collective consciousness</b> to be infected with a whole different set of predetermined archetypes, which then  removes an additional portion of freewill, again based on one’s birthdate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before I could come to this conclusion about the impact of tarot and astrology archetypes on the collective and individual consciousnesses, I had to examine my life in relation to my numerology and its connection to the trumps of the tarot. Once I did that, based on my having a double digit birthdate, I could not deny that the archetype of the tarot trump corresponding to that date, had a very significant impact on my development, long before I even knew the tarot or astrology even existed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Who created these archetypes, anyway? I suspect it was someone <b>playing God</b>. Remove the archetypes and freewill may be restored. I see the archetypes, which are associated with birthdates, as “<b>graven images</b>” that became <b>memes</b> that have infected the collective consciousness, and have robbed freewill from the individual, but also, therefore, the person they were originally intended to be without these predestined, pre-fabricated, pre-appointed archetypal molds that were put into place centuries before the individual was born.</p>

		<h3 class="result"><a href="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/01/07/occulttechno/" rel="bookmark">Occult &amp; Technological Practices Used on&nbsp;TIs</a></h3>					<p>For those of you who see how there is a bigger, occult picture to the plight of <strong>targeted individuals (TI)</strong>, I ask you to read this with an open mind, and please bear with me, as I know I am repeating a few things I have stated in other posts. This post is about the occult and technological practices used on me and other targeted individuals. I will come out with another post soon, God willing, breaking down this stuff, in a list, in separate groups, under a new heading.</p>
<p>After doing some research, due to my own unfortunate situation of being an <strong>unwitting test subject</strong> with actual implants (that anyone can see &amp; feel), I have discovered that this nation has a history of doing <strong>unethical experiments</strong> on unwitting victims. If you were adopted, this may be the case for you.</p>
<p>From Wikipedia:</p>
<p>&#8220;Many of these tests were performed on children, the sick, and mentally disabled individuals, often under the guise of &#8220;medical treatment&#8221;. In many of the studies, a large portion of the subjects were poor, racial minorities, or prisoners.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_experimentation_in_the_United_States">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_experimentation_in_the_United_States</a></p>
<p>I am struck by the numbers of seemingly intelligent people who deny what has been happening to me, even after I show them the implants in my head. Given the placement of these implants (as shown below), I am saddened by my current situation of being a &#8220;<strong>scapegoat</strong>&#8220;.</p>

<p>After doing some research into adoption scandals, it becomes glaringly obvious that I have been used as an experiment for some very evil, disgusting people, &amp; that I was possibly <strong>stolen</strong> from my mother <strong>at birth</strong>, she being told that I was dead, especially when you consider the fact that I was held in custody of this agency for the first six weeks of my life before being placed into an adoptive family, even though my birthmother was supposedly matched up with my adoptive mother long before I was born.</p>
<p><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2011/10/spains-stolen-babies-an-ugly-past-on-a-staggering-scale-2/">http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2011/10/spains-stolen-babies-an-ugly-past-on-a-staggering-scale-2/</a></p>
<p>Although I have tried to contact the agency I was adopted through, I have not yet received a response. Is it that hard for someone to believe that I might have been stolen from my mother at birth, to be used for this hideous program of implantation with <strong>RFID</strong>s &amp; <strong>mind control</strong>?</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_international_adoption_scandals">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_international_adoption_scandals</a></p>
<p>Considering the fact that the system in place, which allows for these experiments to take place, is and always has been heavily involved in <strong>occult</strong> and evil practices, whereby they seem to like to &#8220;<strong>play God</strong>&#8220;, so to speak, how can I keep my mouth shut?</p>
<p>I am now the unfortunate recipient of voices through these implants, which tell me that I am a <strong>ritual sacrifice</strong>, that I was engineered to <a href="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpthoth.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="221" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2012/09/11/symbolism-mind-control-and-metaphysical-sabotage-in-relation-to-archetypal-transference-and-the-second-commandment-of-the-decalogue/12thtrumpthoth-7/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpthoth.jpg" data-orig-size="184,270" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="12thtrumpthoth" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpthoth.jpg?w=184" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpthoth.jpg?w=184" class="alignright size-full wp-image-221" alt="12th Trump from the Thoth Tarot Deck" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpthoth.jpg?w=540" srcset="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpthoth.jpg 184w, https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpthoth.jpg?w=102 102w" sizes="(max-width: 184px) 100vw, 184px"   /></a>born on <strong>12/12</strong> to be that sacrifice, and tell me exactly how my life was ruined through, not only  through the use of these blasted implants (I am trying not to cuss), not only through the use of mind control via tell-a-vision, movies, and mu-sic, but also through the rampant and uncontrolled use of <strong>symbolism</strong> in <strong>astrology</strong> &amp; <strong>tarot</strong>, which are<strong> archetypes</strong> that infect the <strong>collective consciousness</strong>, &amp; the individual&#8217;s <strong>subconscious</strong>, in the form of <strong>memes</strong>. In my case, as seen in the Crowley-Harris Thoth deck&#8217;s 12th trump, I was not only hanging upsidedown from an Egyptian heiroglyph meaning life, but a serpent is attached to my head. I have heard that <strong>Crowley</strong> was an MI6 agent, and a known satanist. Notice that the figure is also unconscious and has hardly any mouth. Could this have something to do with why so many people ignore me? By the way, many of you who know me, know that <strong>mu</strong>=&#8221;12th letter of the greek alphabet&#8221;, and <strong>sic</strong>=&#8221;as intentionally so written&#8221;. Wouldn&#8217;t a person in this metaphysical position have serious issues? It&#8217;s a miracle I didn&#8217;t end up worse than I am. The upsidedown triangle in the lower right of the card indicates that the victim is female. It seems I have been framed.</p>

<p>So, I cannot help but feel as if I am being punished for my actions in this life, which were directly affected by all of the things mentioned above, and therefore, I feel the need to defend myself.</p>
<p>I am now the target for all the things that TIs talk about regarding the torture I experience on a daily basis. I get the pinpricks, the itching, the burning, the constant pain, the gang-stalking, street-theater routine, and I have to watch as bits &amp; pieces of my own story get played out in the various forms of media (tell-a-vision, mu-sic, &amp; movies), as do many victims (I have heard one other TI call this the &#8220;Truman Show Effect&#8221;). This is apparently how victims are farmed for the creative inspiration that naturally results from living in a state of severe but unspeakable <strong>oppression</strong>. They&#8217;ve got this down to a science, folks.</p>
<p>Of course, when I try to put videos out about it, I get the <strong>online harassment</strong> from some very cruel and heartless people who cannot possibly think I am crazy when I only posted about my implants and the history of how RFIDs have been used as early as the 1950s, by people like <strong>Dr. Jose Delgado</strong>, which is a well known fact, &amp; quite easy to research. The fact that I posted a video about my RFIDs &amp; not 15 minutes later, was attacked by at least 20 commenters, lets me know that there are indeed, <strong>disinfo agents</strong> out there, just waiting for the chance to earn a few bucks by attacking a target who is speaking the truth. <strong>Discrediting the victim</strong> is a huge part of their wicked, perverted game.</p>
<p>Here is one other example of how a disinfo agent might work. My youtube user name is the same name I have on this site (<strong>musicis2words</strong>). On youtube, not long after I began to make videos, I saw a user with the moniker, &#8220;ignoramusky&#8221;, as in &#8220;ignore-a-mu-ski&#8221;. Is that a joke? Is he getting paid to do that? Must be quite a cushy job. Or how about the job of those who are tasked with the responsibility of surgically mutilating another individual? How are they able to live with themselves, anyway?</p>
<p>I am sadly reminded of the infamous <strong>Stanley Milgram</strong> experiment where people were willing to administer shocks to others, even to the point of causing heart pain, simply because they were told to.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcvSNg0HZwk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcvSNg0HZwk</a></p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment</a></p>
<p>In the end of it all, I am all too aware of how my <strong>freewill was stolen</strong> from me at birth, and on both physical (implants) and metaphysical (archetypes) levels. Since this is no longer deniable, as I am sure my stalkers are well aware, it becomes very difficult for me to live with the day-to-day degrading and humiliating messages coming from stalkers, both online, in person, and via synthetic telepathy through these implants.</p>
<p>The fact remains that, in my head, at each ear, is <strong>damning evidence</strong> against those who willingly put implants in my head to control my thoughts, emotions, and even my behavior; and in the tarot and astrology is damning evidence that there are indeed occultist elites, running the world, who set individuals like me up, to be made to do things against our will, which makes them directly responsible. I believe this is why I am being tortured. I think they want me dead before I can prove, on a larger scale, what was done to me.</p>
<p>All my life, I felt this absence of higher power, or God. When I was a little girl, I loved <strong>God</strong>, and wanted to serve Him. The bible says that God grantd human beings freewill, but I am saying that humans have taken away a large measure of freewill just through the &#8220;<strong>graven images</strong>&#8221; (images that have become <strong>engraven</strong> into the collective consciousness) of the tarot and astrology, among other things. The bible says that God loves the<strong> truth</strong>, but I have found it increasingly difficult to get anyone to see the truth about what was done to me. What in the world is going on here?</p>
<p>Could I be correct in my attributing the <strong>upsidedown</strong> nature of our world today to the fact that we are living in years surrounding 2012, and the <strong>12th trump</strong> of the tarot is an upsidedown figure in most decks (of which there are over 1,000)? Did those who invented the tarot make that card like that on purpose? Getting it in a reading is supposed to mean &#8220;<strong>redemption through sacrifice</strong>&#8220;, and although my life sure has seemed like one big sacrifice, I have yet to find redemption, in the biblical sense of the term. To me this card is a misuse of what is known as &#8220;<strong>the butterfly effect</strong>&#8220;, whereby a repetion of a vibration increases its amplification.</p>
<p>Okay, so I am ranting now, but everything that I have discovered over the past four and a half years have led me to this point. I so desperately want for the real God, the one who loves each and every one of His creations, to see the truth, and to stop letting me be blamed, and to stop letting me be used, abused, and killed in the process. It&#8217;s no wonder that someone in my position would feel this way. I am accused of all sorts of things that are patently false, as well as some things I am responsible for. However, if I was mind controlled my whole entire life, how can I be blamed? I mean, its not just the archetypal memes, the TV, music, or movies, but it is also <strong>mind control via implants</strong>, which is the most insidious form of mind control I can think of.</p>
<p>It was in 2008 that I discovered the implants, and ever since I have heard audible voices, but for how long was someone &#8220;whispering in my ears&#8221; before I became aware of these things? The idea that a person will not do something under hypnosis that they are not willing to do while conscious has been disproven, so it should be obvious that until I became aware of what was happening, I had been living under a state of <strong>post-hypnotic suggstion</strong>.</p>
<p>For many TIs, life seems like a world where you are the butt of a humungous joke that, until now, everyone has been aware of, but you&#8230; and the joke is, suprise, you&#8217;re being sacrificed! What if this was engineered the whole time that the TI has been living? Would the so-called &#8220;<strong>higher self</strong>&#8221; somehow know this, and have serious issues throughout life because of it?</p>
<p>If you are a TI, I ask you to see if you have the 12 in your <strong>numerology</strong>. It may explain much. Many TIs I have met either have the 12 in their numerology, or they are double digit birthdates.</p>
<p>Another commonality is that many female TIs have some form of the name &#8220;Anne&#8221;, either as a first or middle name. Imagine my suprise on a TI forum, when I saw the moderator&#8217;s email was &#8220;anna-advocate&#8221;, but her group name was &#8220;Jo-Jo-Jive&#8221;. I could just be reading into it, but after what I have been through, I am sensitized to this kind of thing. For example, having initials that spell &#8220;cat&#8221; is used to dehumanize me by my stalkers, but when I looked back on my life and remembered how a woman with the last name &#8220;skinner&#8221; was able to steal and use my ideas, being reminded of the phrase &#8220;skin the cat&#8221;, I am again made to feel like my life is a cruel joke.</p>
<p>It is really just <strong>covert slavery</strong>, which is worse than regular slavery, because the enslaver won&#8217;t even admit that it is happening.</p>
<p>May all TIs find relief from this <strong>heinous crime</strong>.</p>

<p>After everything I have been through in relation to being mind controlled &amp; implanted without my consent, everything I have read about the subject of mind control &amp; ritual abuse, and everything I have read in relation to the so-called &#8220;<strong>Law of Attraction</strong>&#8220;, it occurs to me that those in power who are using mind control against others are doing it with a specific purpose in mind: to get those who are what they call &#8220;expendable&#8221; (the <strong>victims</strong>) to create negative karma and to attract negative things to themselves, so they (the <strong>perpetrators</strong>) can attract more positive things to themselves, their reasoning being that they need to keep a balance in nature. The only way those in power can have more, in their minds, is to take it away from someone else. It is in this way, that they believe they are in balance, and therefore justify their most heinous actions against those against whom they wage war, as well as all those who now find themselves in the unfortunate position of being <strong>nonconsensual human experimentees</strong>, or TIs (<strong>Targeted Individuals</strong>).</p>
<p>It is my contention that this is their way of cheating the &#8220;<strong>game of life</strong>&#8220;. By forcing someone who was originally a very positive and loving child into being a negative teen &amp; adult, they are <strong>circumventing</strong> the <strong>freewill</strong> of an individual. They use the occult to do this, using <strong>astrological</strong> and <strong>tarot <a href="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpthoth.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="221" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2012/09/11/symbolism-mind-control-and-metaphysical-sabotage-in-relation-to-archetypal-transference-and-the-second-commandment-of-the-decalogue/12thtrumpthoth-7/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpthoth.jpg" data-orig-size="184,270" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="12thtrumpthoth" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpthoth.jpg?w=184" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpthoth.jpg?w=184" class="alignright size-full wp-image-221" alt="12th Trump from the Thoth Tarot Deck" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpthoth.jpg?w=540" srcset="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpthoth.jpg 184w, https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpthoth.jpg?w=102 102w" sizes="(max-width: 184px) 100vw, 184px"   /></a>archetypes</strong>, which filter into the <strong>collective consciousness</strong> in the form of <strong>memes</strong>, but by putting <strong>implants</strong> in the victim&#8217;s head, they are better able to control what they have already put in place using the &#8220;The Butterfly Effect&#8221; and &#8220;Law of Attraction&#8221; in combination with the tarot, and in my case, it was the 12th trump of the <strong>Thoth</strong> tarot, authored by Aleister Crowley (a known <strong>satanist</strong>), and illustrated by Frieda Harris. As I have written about in other articles, my birthdate being 12/12 unwittingly tied me to the occult magic of the tarot, causing me to live an &#8220;upside-down life&#8221;, as seen in the Hanged Man card from that deck, in which a person is unconscious, upside-down, 3 limbs nailed down, the other foot tied to an upside-down <strong>ankh</strong> (which is the Egyptian heiroglyph for life, by the way), and a serpent attached to the head of the victim with what appear to be rays. The first manifestation of which came in the form of me being forced to write right-handed, when I was naturally left-inclined, which I have written about in my article called, &#8220;The Case for Left-handedness&#8221;.</p>
<p>I often hear people say &#8220;<strong>what goes around comes around</strong>&#8220;. If some one or some group had a specific<strong> intent</strong> of making someone negative against their nature (via this 12th trump card showing a reversed individual), then those who caused it must, in the end, reap the results of the negativity they forced on an unwitting individual, who had no choices, and no knowledge of the curse until much later in life, coincedentally, in the years leading up to <strong>2012</strong>.</p>
<p>In simpler terms: <strong>Any negative karma caused by a curse and/or mind control programming on an individual should never be reaped by the victim of said programming. It would be akin to blaming a puppet for what the puppet master does.</strong></p>
<p>Also, I feel that the only way to restore true freewill to our population is to remove the archetypes, both tarot and astrological. They are truly &#8220;<strong>graven images</strong>&#8220;, in two ways: 1)They are images that have become <strong>engraven</strong> in the <strong>collective unconscious</strong>through<strong> archetypal transference</strong>; &amp; 2) They are images &#8220;frought with danger or harm&#8221; (that quote is from an online dictionary, defining the word &#8220;grave&#8221;, which is why I believe the actual phrase &#8220;Graven Images&#8221; has been removed from the 2nd Commandment in more recent versions of the Bible.</p>

		<h3 class="result"><a href="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2012/10/27/appealtogodfreewill/" rel="bookmark">On the Concept of Freewill (an appeal to&nbsp;God)</a></h3>					<p><b>An Appeal to God On the Concept of Freewill        (9/29/2012, update 10/30/2012)</b></p>
<p>Given my circumstances, I have given a great deal of thought to the whole question of “<strong>freewill</strong>”. At this point in time, it seems to me that freewill is mostly an illusion. I am not the only one who feels this way. There may be some freewill, but it seems to be very limited, based on a person’s <strong>archetypes</strong>, both astrological and tarot. I have come to the startling realization that archetypes are an example of &#8220;<strong>graven images</strong>&#8221; from the 2nd commandment. While many people interperet the 2nd commandment as referring to idolatry, it seems to me that the 1st commandment covers that. It is suspicious to me that newer versions of the bible have omitted the phrase &#8220;graven images&#8221; from the bible.</p>
<p>From Wikipedia: <b>“You shall not make for yourself an idol”</b> is an abbreviated form of one of the <a title="Ten Commandments" href="/wiki/Ten_Commandments">Ten Commandments</a> which, according to the book of Deuteronomy, were spoken by God to Israel and then written on stone tablets by God himself.&#8221; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_shall_not_make_for_yourself_an_idol#.E2.80.9CImages.E2.80.9D_commanded_by_God">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_shall_not_make_for_yourself_an_idol#.E2.80.9CImages.E2.80.9D_commanded_by_God</a></p>
<p>Does anyone ever wonder why the newer versions of the bible have removed the phrase &#8220;graven images&#8221; from the 2nd commandment? Graven means &#8220;frought with danger or harm&#8221;. Could it be that someone or some group has the intent of not answering for thie graven images, and the harmful results of those images on unwitting victims? The bible states that God granted people freewill, which is taken away due to the impact of archetypes on the <strong>collective consciousness</strong>, and consequently, the individual&#8217;s consciousness. These archetypes are &#8220;images&#8221; that have become &#8220;<strong>engraven</strong>&#8221; into the mind via <strong>memes</strong> that replicate every time someone looks at these cards, which in turn, amplifies the energy of that archetype, making it become even more &#8220;engraven&#8221; into the collective consciousness.</p>
<p>I say this because I have been a victim of the Hanged Man archetype (reversal, sacrifice, indecision) from the tarot, due to my birthdate being 12/12. Although I never knew about the tarot archetypes until later in life, they still had a profound effect on me since I was a child. This is why I have come to the realization that, while I never knew about the archetype, it still had effects on, not only my personality traits, but also on certain events in my life. One example of how the reversed nature of the Hanged Man archetype manifested itself in my life is that I was made to be right-handed, even though I was naturally left-handed. I was told that being left-handed was evil, so I made myself be right-handed, because I wanted to be good. I was a good girl who loved God with all my heart and soul.</p>
<p>The transfer of an archetypal pattern into the circumstances of one&#8217;s life is what I see as <strong>archetypal transference.</strong> That being said, there are differing points of view on this subject. I have a link to a great article called, &#8220;<em>Archetypal Semiotic</em> Transference&#8221;, by Michael Gaio, at the end of this document.</p>
<p>Astrological archetypes are pretty straightforward. If you are born in a certain month, you have a specific sign, and your personality traits usually reflect this. If you are born on the cusp, then you probably carry traits of both signs. Does anyone ever question why this is usually the case for most people? Is it a natural thing, or <i>is the fact that someone assigned these archetypes to people based on their birthdates, in effect, a type of programming that severely restricts freewill</i>? At least with astrology, you get a basic idea of someone’s personality. Who designed this system, anyway, and why? There are so many different answers to this question, depending on which source you go by. Generally speaking, each society has a different system they use. Is it so those in power could have a large measure of control over others based on their astrological archetypes? Is the fact that these archetypes are in the mass collective consciousness the actual reason why people carry personality traits related to their signs?</p>
<p>In astrology, I am Sagittarius, but also Ophiuchus. Many people don’t consider the sign of Ophiuchus because they say it does not lie on the ecliptic, however, its feet certainly do. Therefore, in my opinion, this 13<sup>th</sup> sign should be acknowledged. There are astrologers out there who do feel this way about the 13<sup>th</sup> sign. I have wondered if the serpent class had this sign removed out of fear that they would lose their constricting hold on the world.</p>
<p>However, I am one of those people who believe that a 13 moon calendar should be used. I feel the current Gregorian calendar is just a way to mess with people’s heads. I mean, think about it, why is December the 12<sup>th</sup> month, but the root word “dec” means 10; then there is Novemeber, which is the 11<sup>th</sup> month, but the root “nov” means 9, and so on. I have to wonder if these months were named specifically to confuse people on a subliminal level. We have January, February… okay, they could be symbolic of 1 and 2, but what happens with March. It is the 3<sup>rd</sup> month, so why not call it Tertiary. April could be called Quatruary. You get the idea.</p>
<p>If this is of God, then I am completely lost. I don’t want to believe that God would allow certain people to be cursed from birth, throughout their lives. I don’t want to believe that God would let human beings effectively destroy the freewill of other people. I don&#8217;t want to believe that God would allow someone to destroy the life of a child who so deeply loved God before her life was so turned around by these &#8220;graven images&#8221; of the archetypes.</p>
<p>The only way to bring freewill back into this world is to abolish archetypes. By tying someone&#8217;s birthdate to zodiacal signs &amp; tarot correspondences, freewill has been virtually removed.The fact that most people in our societies believe in astrology, means that these archetypes have been inserted into the collective consciousness. This removes a measure of freewill. The fact that the tarot has become so popular in recent decades, has also infected the collective consciousness with certain archetypes, which then also removes freewill. Remove the archetypes &amp; freewill may be restored.</p>

<p>Back in the 1970s, I had this thought that perhaps everything we think we see around us isn’t quite the true reality, and that what we perceive is actually a sort of façade, put in place to keep us from seeing the whole truth about the nature of the world in which human beings exist. I thought of it kind of like a movie screen obstructing our view of the forces at work in our lives. I would later see this concept aptly illustrated in two movies: <strong><em>The Matrix</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Dark City</em></strong>.</p>
<p>The words “<strong>as above, so below</strong>” seem to illustrate this concept (below=the physical &amp; above=the metaphysical) with regards to the archetypes, including tarot, astrology, and the every day <img data-attachment-id="767" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/02/01/welcome-to-lord-of-the-flies-government-style/justiceblind-2/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/justiceblind.jpg" data-orig-size="106,160" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="justiceblind" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/justiceblind.jpg?w=106" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/justiceblind.jpg?w=106" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-767" alt="justiceblind" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/justiceblind.jpg?w=99&#038;h=150" width="99" height="150" srcset="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/justiceblind.jpg?w=99&amp;h=150 99w, https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/justiceblind.jpg 106w" sizes="(max-width: 99px) 100vw, 99px" />archetypes we are exposed to, such as the archetype of <a href="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/09/20/why-is-justice-blind/" target="_blank">justice</a>, which is a perfect example of what is happening in this world, allowing some very evil &amp; greedy people to get away with what basically amounts murder. With regards to astrology: The stars are above and we are below them. How many Leos out there are hogs for the spotlight? How many Aries out there get whatever they want? How many Libras out there think they have the right to judge others? Scorpios are known for being hurtful, and most of the ones I knew were. You often hear about Gemini’s being two-faced. If it isn’t evident on the surface how the person relates to the image of their sign, then it might relate on a deeper, perhaps metaphysical, level. It could simply be a case of what I’ve heard called, “<strong>Archetypal Transference</strong>”. What about Sagittarius? What about Ophiuchus, which has been taken out of the collective group of star signs, even though its feet lie on the ecliptic? Ophiuchus is the sign showing a person holding a serpent, and in some cases, that serpent has been broken. Why did they abolish this sign, I wonder? Could it have something to do with what is known as the <img data-attachment-id="1346" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2012/09/07/as-above-so-below-are-we-programmed-by-archetypes/bisconeserpent/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/bisconeserpent.jpg" data-orig-size="125,160" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="bisconeserpent" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/bisconeserpent.jpg?w=125" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/bisconeserpent.jpg?w=125" class="alignright size-full wp-image-1346" alt="bisconeserpent" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/bisconeserpent.jpg?w=540"   />“<strong>serpent class</strong>”, the <strong>elites</strong> who run the world? Perhaps this means that we should abolish the astrological symbols in general, in an effort to truly allow people to have<strong> freewill</strong>.</p>

<p>I do not say this lightly. Who invented astrology, and why? Well, it depends on which source you accept. It is said that the Chaldean Babylonians who first used the birth charts in relation to the zodiac based on the 12 signs, who brought it to Egypt (<a href="http://www.zodiacal.com/articles/hand/history.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.zodiacal.com/articles/hand/history.htm</a>). The first zodiac was supposedly invented by the Chinese in 2200BC. The first horoscopic zodiac that is close to what is in use today is believed to have been invented by the Greeks, also borrowing from the Chaldeans (<a href="http://www.stargazers.com/kepler1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.stargazers.com/kepler1.html</a>). Perhaps it was an accident that the archetypes, imbedded in our subconscious, have created a basic program for people, depending on their birthdate. An “if, then” statement as in computer programming, would seem to allow for freewill, but it is my contention that it allows for very limited freewill, after a very set and detailed amount of programming has already been put in place, via the archetypes in astrology, as well as in the tarot, which has gained so much in popularity over the past few years.</p>
<p>So the question that would naturally follow is: Do the Tarot and astrology put a certain type of irresistible programming into place, since these archetypes have been around such a long time, and are embedded into our collective subconscious?</p>
<p>What if everything in this world really is like a computer simulation, like in the movie, The Matrix? I ask this because, in addition to the archetypes from the systems mentioned above, I am noticing things in our language that so closely resemble a type of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMe5Y4Hs_7c" target="_blank"><strong>programming</strong></a>, that I have to ask the question, “Are we all merely programmed entities walking around on this planet, none of us truly having freewill?” Are some of us programmed to be negative on purpose, to allow others to be positive? Are some of us programmed to be caring and deeply feeling people while others are programmed to actually hurt people? Are some of us programmed to fail, while others are programmed to succeed? While I do see there are numerous variables regarding <strong>astrology</strong>,<strong> tarot</strong>, and <strong>numerology</strong>, it does seem that we have all been programmed to a certain degree.</p>
<p>Is this what the <strong>second commandment of the Decalogue</strong> really meant, before the Bible had <img data-attachment-id="238" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2012/09/11/symbolism-mind-control-and-metaphysical-sabotage-in-relation-to-archetypal-transference-and-the-second-commandment-of-the-decalogue/12thtrumphermetictarot/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumphermetictarot.gif" data-orig-size="304,500" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="12thTrumpHermeticTarot" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumphermetictarot.gif?w=182" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumphermetictarot.gif?w=304" class="wp-image-238 alignright" alt="12th Trump from The Hermetic Tarot" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumphermetictarot.gif?w=117&#038;h=192" width="117" height="192" />been translated an unknown number of times? Could it be that these images, embedded in the collective unconscious and in the individual’s subconscious, have become “<em>engraven</em>” in our minds? Could it be that the bible was trying to grant freewill to the people, which had previously been taken away via so-called <strong><em>graven images</em></strong>? The Bible tells us that God gave us freewill, but I contend that astrology, the tarot, and even some bible stories, took it away with the use of archetypes, whether people are conscious of the effects or not.</p>
<p>One example of an over-arching archetype affecting our world shows up in the “<strong>Madonna-Whore</strong>” complex, as described by Freud, except that it not only affects men in our world. In the Christian story about Jesus and the crucifixion, we have two Mary’s: Jesus’ mother, and Mary Magdalene. Does this create a subversive and subliminal complex in women based on the meme perpetuated by this story?</p>

For example, think about the Aries you know, especially those born in the 4th month, who are thus given the Emperor card, or the Leos born in the 8th month, who are given Strength. The 5th trump of most tarot decks is called the Hierophant, and I wish I knew someone born on 5/5 (Taurus), to see what their life pattern has been. Is it correct to give so many others a position of power (4th trump) or abundance (3rd trump), and then force the 12th trump to be the Hanged Man (called the Dying God in the Thoth deck)?</p>
<p>I feel that the occultists who seem to be running the world have put very powerful programs into place via the tarot, astrology, evil magic, technology, and even our language, to make people generally  unwell, and even argumentative. It is all very symbolic. One only needs to look at words and their roots to see how they can have symbolic and subliminal effects on people, to understand that images have a similar effect which is much more subtle. For example, someone could have the name Bill, which could be seen as “Be ill”, and it might subliminally affect either those reading the name, or the one who has that name. Consider the word television that phonetically sounds like “tell-a-vision”. An example I find most interesting is the word “music”, which is broken down to two words, <a href="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/mu1.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="155" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2012/09/07/as-above-so-below-are-we-programmed-by-archetypes/mu1/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/mu1.jpg" data-orig-size="275,183" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="MU1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/mu1.jpg?w=275" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/mu1.jpg?w=275" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-155 alignright" alt="MU1" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/mu1.jpg?w=150&#038;h=99" width="150" height="99" srcset="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/mu1.jpg?w=150&amp;h=99 150w, https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/mu1.jpg 275w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a><strong>Mu:</strong> the 12<sup>th</sup> letter of the Greek alphabet, and <strong>Sic:</strong> “as intentionally so written”.</p>
<p>Much programming could very easily be put into people’s minds based on their name alone, much less via tarot and astrological archetypes. For example, do people with the name “Michael” subconsciously believe that they are angels, or “of God”, and have a certain amount of power over others?  Someone who has initials that spell “dog” or “cat”, might subconsciously identify with that animal, which could create an extra sensitive nature in that person, but could also serve to <strong>dehumanize</strong> them. Identifying with an animal would be a double-edged sword, to say the least, considering that most people believe animals to be more sensitive than people. So would being named after an animal be some sort of curse, making someone have experiences that others will automatically deny, simply because they don’t experience them? <strong>It is akin to the situation of doctors in 1920 calling someone crazy because they didn’t have the right microscopes to see the disease from which their patient was suffering.</strong></p>
<p>While being outside of a room where a <a href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2014/02/26/brain-washing-social-control-programming-kill-your-television/" target="_blank">television</a> (tell-a-vision) set was on, I could hear a subliminal message being delivered, that said, “abuse her”. This was at a house where a 40 year old man and his <img data-attachment-id="927" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/07/04/mind-control-and-the-targeted-individual/tvmc/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/tvmc.jpg" data-orig-size="160,142" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="TVMC" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/tvmc.jpg?w=160" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/tvmc.jpg?w=160" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-927 alignleft" alt="TVMC" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/tvmc.jpg?w=150&#038;h=133" width="150" height="133" srcset="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/tvmc.jpg?w=150&amp;h=133 150w, https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/tvmc.jpg 160w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />86 year old mother were living. Interestingly enough, the mother often had complaints of him pinching her and pushing her (although she never told me that he hit her). I often saw cuts and bruises on this woman. Was he influenced, albeit subconsciously, to believe that because he was “of God”, simply because his name was Michael, that it was okay to push his elderly mother around? Was it somehow easier for my own mother to berate and degrade me because she and I subconsciously identified me with an animal?</p>
<p>All my life, I have felt like there was something not quite right about things in our world. It seems like I had been living under a curse of <strong>self-fulfilling prophecies</strong> and rampant <a href="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/09/29/memes-law-of-attraction-2/" target="_blank"><strong>memes</strong></a>, resulting from the amplification of the &#8220;upsidedown&#8221; hanged man archetype, through a growth in popularity of the tarot &amp; numerous printings of over 1000 different tarot decks. My parents were upper middle class, and so I was left with various nannies for the first 9 years of my life. After their divorce, my mother didn’t have to work, yet she left me alone most of the time. I’d had bad experiences with doctors, dentists, and oral surgeons. Teachers were often unfair and unkind to me. My art career, while I had received a scholarship at the school I attended, had somehow been sabotaged by other artists. For example, one artist stole my ideas, while another wrecked one of my paintings. While I always did my best at my jobs, and usually became the top performer, I was never able to climb the corporate ladder. After much considerations of astrology and the tarot, I have come to the conclusion that, in my case, these archetypes (especially that of the 12<sup>th</sup> trump of the tarot) caused a pattern in my life, over which I had no control. This issue refutes the idea of freewill as an absolute, which contradicts what most of us are told as we grow up.</p>
<p>I contend that these two supposed tools for divination do not allow for much freewill, for we all seem to be behaving within the parameters set up by these archetypes, which are in the collective consciousness. What tarot and horoscope readings denote to the reader and the querant obscure what these images do to the collective consciousness, as well as the individual mind that views them.</p>
<p>At any rate… how can anyone, who has been programmed by these archetypes, be blamed for their behavior that is a direct result of (often a reaction to) such programming? It would be interesting to do a study on people over 40, born on specific double digit birthdates, as in relation to their star sign as well as the corresponding major arcana card from the tarot, just to see how their lives had turned out.</p>
<p>I have documented my own situation with mind control programming, in relation to my birthdate (a double digit), and how it was used with the tarot to create a general curse in my life, and I have met other people with double digit birthdates who have suffered under similar circumstances.
