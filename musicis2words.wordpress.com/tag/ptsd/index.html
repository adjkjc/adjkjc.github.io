<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Trauma and Its Effects on the Psyche/Spirit</strong>  </span></p>
<p>(Links to resources at bottom of article)</p>
<p>Most people these days understand that <em>trauma</em> has <em>psychological effects</em>. If you&#8217;ve been reading my other articles, then you understand that the word <em>psyche</em> derives from both Greek and Latin words that refer to &#8220;<em>spirit</em>&#8220;.</p>
<p><strong><em>Psychology</em> is therefore, the study of the <em>psyche</em> or <em>spirit</em>. </strong></p>
<p><em>Trauma</em> in childhood is recognized in the psychological community as having a negative impact on behavior, causing things like PTSD, Depression, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Borderline Personality Disorder, Antisocial Personality Disorder, Paranoid Personality Disorder, and Schizoid Personality Disorder, to name a few. I suspect that the more trauma a person has in their life, whether in childhood or adulthood, the more problems will manifest in their <em>psyche</em> (<em>spirit</em>), and in their behavior, causing them to be prescribed multiple psych drugs over their lifetimes.</p>
<p>Is this some sort of a formula or what?</p>
<p>While I do have some strong misgivings about the discipline of psychology and their over-emphasis on drugs for behavioral disorders, when there are no real objective tests for most of these disorders, this does not make <em>psychology</em> an invalid science&#8230; just a flawed &amp; corrupted one, in need of more thorough oversight in the community, since it seems like the whole discipline has fallen into the hands of big pharma.</p>
<p>People with <em>PTSD</em> have been found to have elevated stress hormones (cortisol) which can lead to heart disease, and also to the shrinkage of the hippocampus (which affects the transfer of facts from short-term to long-term memory).</p>
<p><strong>Trauma &amp; Circumcision:</strong></p>
<p>After doing some research on the subject of <em>trauma &amp; PTSD</em>, I have noticed that the most common groups studied in relation to this are veterans &amp; children. I find it interesting that no one seems to be studying the effects of trauma in infancy. I realize that this may be more difficult to get anecdotal information from infants, however, one could measure the amounts of cortisol in the brain before &amp; after a <em>circumcision</em>, for example, or before and after a child is taken from its natural mother during the adoption process.</p>
<p>I mention circumcision because it is the mutilation of a male child&#8217;s penis, usually done immediately after birth, unless the child is an orthodox Jew, who will get this done at 13 years old, viewing it as a &#8220;rite of passage&#8221;. When I consider circumcision, I cannot help but consider the long term psychological impact of this practice on a newborn baby. Sadly, the families who allow it &amp; the doctors who perform it apparently do not question the ramifications of this wicked trauma done on a newborn. I think this is why so many males don&#8217;t question going off to war&#8230; they&#8217;ve already been prepped with violence.</p>
<p>Circumcision is a physical assault on the most sensitive part of a male child&#8217;s body, which then makes it a violation of the psyche as well. If considered in combination with the existence of the chakras, this mutilation of an organ in the <em>root chakra</em> has affects on emotions involving <em>security</em> needs. <em>Trauma</em> at such a young age, whether through circumcision or through the unceremonious routines of measuring &amp; weighing, blood testing, a vitamin K shot, vaccines, &amp; drops or ointment in the eyes, would seem to have some sort of emotional impact on the <em>psyche</em> of a newborn baby that is supposed to be experiencing its first few hours bonding with its mother.</p>
<p><strong>About the root chakra:</strong> &#8220;<em>The root chakra is responsible for your sense of belonging, safety, and security in the world</em>.  It’s main concern is <em>survival of the self</em>. (Emphasis Mine) The health of our blood, immune system, bones, joints and spine is dependent on the emotions associated with this chakra. It envelops the body’s basic needs for safety, money, sexuality, groundedness and boundaries.  People who have trouble with their first chakra may not have developed a strong identity and have not discovered their life purpose.  If they are too yin they may be ungrounded.  If they are too yang there might be too much attachment to material things, too much self-indulgence and a preoccupation with satisfaction of their own needs.&#8221;  &#8211; from naturalhealthtechniques.com (link below)</p>
<p>So any trauma in early infancy would naturally have effects on the root chakra, causing security issues in the psyche, which then ripens them up to be conditioned into good little consumers, who are very needy, and often greedy.</p>
<p>Circumcision would of course have the strongest impact of all the &#8220;routine&#8221; procedures done to a newborn after birth. Have you ever seen a circumcision on a newborn baby? The one I saw was awful, &amp; proved to me that babies do feel pain, regardless of what the doctor may tell you. The question is, what are the long term effects of such a traumatic procedure on an infant&#8217;s psyche?</p>
<p>It is my feeling that trauma in infancy &amp; early childhood has a tendency to soften up the mind &amp; make people more easily controlled by the <em>societal conditioning</em>, which is in turn, controlled by the so-called &#8220;<em>hidden hand</em>&#8221; (corporate elites), through the use of education, religion, television, movies, music, literature, &amp; yes, even through the use of <em>brain implants</em>, on par with the research of people like <em>Dr. Jose Delgado</em> &amp; <em>Dr. Ewen Cameron</em>. It sets in the newborn&#8217;s mind, a state of shock, coloring almost everything that happens shortly after birth, including the bonding experience with the parents. I suspect that the traumatized brain of an infant or young child is much more easily hypnotized by the flicker-rate of the television, which is known to induce a trance-like state in those who watch it.</p>
<p><strong>Trauma &amp; Adoption:</strong></p>
<p>There are other traumas that occur during infancy, such as <em>adoption</em>. Now recognized as a traumatic experience by many metal health professionals, with life-long consequences, adoption has a deep psychological impact on the child, leading to a disproportionate number of adoptees seeking help for mental health issues. Adoptees often end up with various forms of attachment disorder, addictions, depression, &amp; obsessive behaviors, to name a few.</p>
<p>While the damage from the aforementioned traumas may have already been done to the psyche, &amp; while some of these people do need medication for the deep psychological issues caused by these events in order to be functional, would it not make perfect sense to examine evidence (measuring cortisol) that is now available with relation to <em>trauma &amp; its effects on the brain</em>?</p>
<p><strong>Trauma Based Mind Control:</strong></p>
<p>Most people who have done any research into the subject of <em>trauma-based mind control</em> understand that it is a powerful way to alter the mind. The more sensational cases of people, like Cathy O&#8217;Brien or Brice Taylor, speak of the splitting of the mind into <em>multiple personalities</em> through the use of trauma. <strong>I contend that the creation of MPD in a person is not necessary for mind control to be achieved</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Learned Helplessness:</strong></p>
<p>Evidence of this concept can be found in the way the American public mostly sat back &amp; watched as their freedoms were eroded in the years following September 11th, 2001. Had they not been repeatedly exposed to the trauma of the event at the World Trade Center, would it have been as easy for those in power to erode American liberties? Does the fact that the United States has been at war for so many years now have a general impact on the <em>collective psyche</em> of its inhabitants, a population which was raised on television? Is it possible that trauma delivered on such a large scale has anchored trauma in infancy or childhood, &amp; induced a state of <em>learned helplessness</em>?</p>
<p>&#8220;The concept of learned helplessness was discovered accidentally by psychologists Martin Seligman and Steven F. Maier. They had initially observed helpless behavior in dogs that were classically conditioned to expect an electrical shock after hearing a tone. Later, the dogs were placed in a shuttlebox that contained two chambers separated by a low barrier. The floor was electrified on one side, and not on the other. The dogs previously subjected to the classical conditioning made no attempts to escape, even though avoiding the shock simply involved jumping over a low barrier.&#8221; &#8211; from psychology.about.com (link below)</p>
<p>The above study was done in 1967.</p>
<p>Please reread that above paragraph &amp; let the information sink in. It shows that <em>repeated trauma</em> can induce a state of <em>learned helplessness</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Trauma &amp; Television in Conditioning:</strong></p>
<p>Traumatize a baby &amp; then sit it in front of the television for a while. Most people go into a sort of trance when watching television anyway, due to the <em>flicker-rate</em> (aka &#8220;refresh-rate&#8221;) effect. Since the child&#8217;s mind is like a sponge, it will suck up all the programming you want. Granted, this is a highly contested statement about television <em>programming</em>, however, it should be considered that, at the very least, watching TV can put a person into a hypnotic, trance-like state, causing things being said to them afterwards to have the possibility of becoming a <em>post-hypnotic suggestion</em>. Hence, advertising.</p>
<p>Let me illustrate this idea: Let&#8217;s say you are a 13 year old kid, watching a couple of hours of TV before bed. Right after you turn that TV off, you hear your dad complaining that you didn&#8217;t take the trash out or get the mail. He gets angry &amp; says that you&#8217;re stupid a number of times. Does this statement that you are stupid have an increased possibility of becoming a <em>self-fulfilling prophecy</em> because you were just in a trance for the past 2 hours before hearing it? Would there be a difference in the effect depending on whether you experienced trauma in infancy or early childhood? Could this have something to do with the reason many victims of mind control programs cite the <em>ritual drowning</em> at 3 years old as being one of their experiences?</p>
<p>It seems to me that trauma has as one of its effects a type of <em>fracture</em> <em>of the psyche</em> or spirit. Setting newborn babies up in this way has caused most of us to end up with an unnatural state of need &amp; insecurity, which is then played on by all sorts of advertising making people desire things they do not need. It also has, as an unfortunate (but possibly intended) side effect: a tendency to cause symptoms such as obsessions, attention deficit disorders, depression, hoarding, paranoia, eating disorders, drug &amp; alcohol addiction, shopping addictions, social anxiety, &amp; other behaviors categorized as <em>mental dysfunction</em>. In reality, these behavioral problems are merely a reaction to adverse stimuli that has occurred since birth, &amp; in some cases, over the course of a lifetime.</p>
<p><strong>Natural Trauma: </strong></p>
<p>There are plenty of traumas that are natural aspects of life. These include birth, loss of a parent, injuries, etc. These natural traumas may cause some issues with the psyche, but they will be healed over time. The problem is that there are so many orchestrated &amp; manipulated traumas in a person&#8217;s life these days, including the examples I mentioned above, that the psyche never gets a real chance to heal.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion: </strong></p>
<p>Between trauma in infancy &amp; early childhood, and trauma witnessed in the news every day, it becomes clear to see an atmosphere of terror is causing these mental/emotional/spiritual issues to manifest in people. The event of what happened to the <em>World Trade Center</em> marked a turning point in traumatizing the masses to allow those with power to enslave the people in such a way, that they would not even recognize their slavery.</p>
<p>Is it any wonder that so many people these days are running to the psych doctor for medication to alleviate their symptoms?</p>
<p>Is it any wonder that people have allowed their civil liberties to be eroded, given the discovery of learned helplessness as related to trauma? This has been going on longer than anyone realizes, &amp; has far reaching implications.</p>

<p><strong>Trauma and Its Effects on the Psyche/Spirit</strong></p>
<p>(Links to resources at bottom of article)</p>
<p>Most people these days understand that <em>trauma</em> has <em>psychological effects</em>. If you&#8217;ve been reading my other articles, then you understand that the word <em>psyche</em> derives from both Greek and Latin words that refer to &#8220;<em>spirit</em>&#8220;.</p>
<p><strong><em>Psychology</em> is therefore, the study of the <em>psyche</em> or <em>spirit</em>. </strong></p>
<p><em>Trauma</em> in childhood is recognized in the psychological community as having a negative impact on behavior, causing things like PTSD, Depression, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Borderline Personality Disorder, Antisocial Personality Disorder, Paranoid Personality Disorder, and Schizoid Personality Disorder, to name a few. I suspect that the more trauma a person has in their life, whether in childhood or adulthood, the more problems will manifest in their <em>psyche</em> (<em>spirit</em>), and in their behavior, causing them to be prescribed multiple psych drugs over their lifetimes.</p>
<p>Is this some sort of a formula or what?</p>
<p>While I do have some strong misgivings about the discipline of psychology and their over-emphasis on drugs for behavioral disorders, when there are no real objective tests for most of these disorders, this does not make <em>psychology</em> an invalid science&#8230; just a flawed &amp; corrupted one, in need of more thorough oversight in the community, since it seems like the whole discipline has fallen into the hands of big pharma.</p>
<p>People with <em>PTSD</em> have been found to have elevated stress hormones (cortisol) which can lead to heart disease, and also to the shrinkage of the hippocampus (which affects the transfer of facts from short-term to long-term memory).</p>
<p><strong>Trauma &amp; Circumcision:</strong></p>
<p>After doing some research on the subject of <em>trauma &amp; PTSD</em>, I have noticed that the most common groups studied in relation to this are veterans &amp; children. I find it interesting that no one seems to be studying the effects of trauma in infancy. I realize that this may be more difficult to get anecdotal information from infants, however, one could measure the amounts of cortisol in the brain before &amp; after a <em>circumcision</em>, for example, or before and after a child is taken from its natural mother during the adoption process.</p>
<p>I mention circumcision because it is the mutilation of a male child&#8217;s penis, usually done immediately after birth, unless the child is an orthodox Jew, who will get this done at 13 years old, viewing it as a &#8220;rite of passage&#8221;. When I consider circumcision, I cannot help but consider the long term psychological impact of this practice on a newborn baby. Sadly, the families who allow it &amp; the doctors who perform it apparently do not question the ramifications of this wicked trauma done on a newborn. I think this is why so many males don&#8217;t question going off to war&#8230; they&#8217;ve already been prepped with violence.</p>
<p>Circumcision is a physical assault on the most sensitive part of a male child&#8217;s body, which then makes it a violation of the psyche as well. If considered in combination with the existence of the chakras, this mutilation of an organ in the <em>root chakra</em> has affects on emotions involving <em>security</em> needs. <em>Trauma</em> at such a young age, whether through circumcision or through the unceremonious routines of measuring &amp; weighing, blood testing, a vitamin K shot, vaccines, &amp; drops or ointment in the eyes, would seem to have some sort of emotional impact on the <em>psyche</em> of a newborn baby that is supposed to be experiencing its first few hours bonding with its mother.</p>
<p><strong>About the root chakra:</strong> &#8220;<em>The root chakra is responsible for your sense of belonging, safety, and security in the world</em>.  It’s main concern is <em>survival of the self</em>. (Emphasis Mine) The health of our blood, immune system, bones, joints and spine is dependent on the emotions associated with this chakra. It envelops the body’s basic needs for safety, money, sexuality, groundedness and boundaries.  People who have trouble with their first chakra may not have developed a strong identity and have not discovered their life purpose.  If they are too yin they may be ungrounded.  If they are too yang there might be too much attachment to material things, too much self-indulgence and a preoccupation with satisfaction of their own needs.&#8221;  &#8211; from naturalhealthtechniques.com (link below)</p>
<p>So any trauma in early infancy would naturally have effects on the root chakra, causing security issues in the psyche, which then ripens them up to be good little consumers, who are very needy, and often greedy.</p>
<p>Circumcision would of course have the strongest impact of all the &#8220;routine&#8221; procedures done to a newborn after birth. Have you ever seen a circumcision on a newborn baby? The one I saw was awful, &amp; proved to me that babies do feel pain, regardless of what the doctor may tell you. The question is, what are the long term effects of such a traumatic procedure on an infant&#8217;s psyche?</p>
<p>It is my feeling that trauma in infancy &amp; early childhood has a tendency to soften up the mind &amp; make people more easily controlled by the <em>societal conditioning</em>, which is in turn, controlled by the so-called &#8220;<em>hidden hand</em>&#8221; (corporate elites), through the use of education, religion, television, movies, music, literature, &amp; yes, even through the use of <em>brain implants</em>, on par with the research of people like <em>Dr. Jose Delgado</em> &amp; <em>Dr. Ewen Cameron</em>. It sets in the newborn&#8217;s mind, a state of shock, coloring almost everything that happens shortly after birth, including the bonding experience with the parents. I suspect that the traumatized brain of an infant or young child is much more easily hypnotized by the flicker-rate of the television, which is known to induce a trance-like state in those who watch it.</p>
<p><strong>Trauma &amp; Adoption:</strong></p>
<p>There are other traumas that occur during infancy, such as <em>adoption</em>. Now recognized as a traumatic experience by many metal health professionals, with life-long consequences, adoption has a deep psychological impact on the child, leading to a disproportionate number of adoptees seeking help for mental health issues. Adoptees often end up with various forms of attachment disorder, addictions, depression, &amp; obsessive behaviors, to name a few.</p>
<p>While the damage from the aforementioned traumas may have already been done to the psyche, &amp; while some of these people do need medication for the deep psychological issues caused by these events in order to be functional, would it not make perfect sense to examine evidence (measuring cortisol) that is now available with relation to <em>trauma &amp; its effects on the brain</em>?</p>
<p><strong>Trauma Based Mind Control:</strong></p>
<p>Most people who have done any research into the subject of <em>trauma-based mind control</em> understand that it is a powerful way to alter the mind. The more sensational cases of people, like Cathy O&#8217;Brien or Brice Taylor, speak of the splitting of the mind into <em>multiple personalities</em> through the use of trauma. <strong>I contend that the creation of MPD in a person is not necessary for mind control to be achieved</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Learned Helplessness:</strong></p>
<p>Evidence of this concept can be found in the way the American public mostly sat back &amp; watched as their freedoms were eroded in the years following September 11th, 2001. Had they not been repeatedly exposed to the trauma of the event at the World Trade Center, would it have been as easy for those in power to erode American liberties? Does the fact that the United States has been at war for so many years now have a general impact on the <em>collective psyche</em> of its inhabitants, a population which was raised on television? Is it possible that trauma delivered on such a large scale has anchored trauma in infancy or childhood, &amp; induced a state of <em>learned helplessness</em>?</p>
<p>&#8220;The concept of learned helplessness was discovered accidentally by psychologists Martin Seligman and Steven F. Maier. They had initially observed helpless behavior in dogs that were classically conditioned to expect an electrical shock after hearing a tone. Later, the dogs were placed in a shuttlebox that contained two chambers separated by a low barrier. The floor was electrified on one side, and not on the other.

<p>I am a victim of mind control, PTSD, and OTSD.</p>
<p>I am threatened with poverty, jail, death, and eternal damnation, on a near constant basis. I also feel horrible pain in my privates. I was driven nuts in 2008 when I first began to hear their voices, telling me that all soul mates were coming back together &amp; that everything was going to be made good in the world. Eventually, all those good sentiments turned into sheer psychological torture, on top of the physical pain in my privates which had disabled me to the point where I could not work a job, as I was on the floor screaming in pain for about 3 months.</p>
<p>The excuses for what they are doing to me are as follows: I am told that it serves me right, that I’m evil, that I’m satan or a demon &amp; that these rfid-sized implants in my ears are horns. I’m told I was bad &amp; that this is my punishment. I am told that it’s my karma although, if I had been allowed to develop the way God or nature intended, I would be a completely different person. I also hear that it’s because I am a bastard, &amp; God don’t love bastards. Although, being adopted doesn’t necessarily mean that I was born out of wedlock, nor does it mean that my parents didn’t want me, considering all those adoption scandals out there.</p>
<p>I have also been told that they want no witnesses, so could they be alluding to my status as a nonconsensual human experimentee? These rfid-sized chips going through the the cartilage of my ears would indicate that this is a possibility. I am wearing the proof of what was done to me, &amp; it is in their best interest to kill me. I can only hope that they die &amp; come back into my life, to see how well they end up. While I may have made many mistakes in my life, I’m no serial killer, for cryin outloud!</p>
<p>More often than not, most other victims I come across do not keep in touch. We will send a couple of emails back and forth, or comment to each other on a blog or website, and then it’s like they begin to ignore me &amp; won’t respond to my posts. I’m talking about people who experience the same stuff I do, or claim to anyway.</p>
<p>Have I become one of the untouchables that not even other Tis or folks in the so-called “truth movement” are willing to talk to? Am I like a leper?</p>

<p><b>Some people will say I am playing the victim, but I assure you that this is not by choice. </b></p>
<p><b>Some people will say I am lying, but you cannot make this stuff up, and I have photos that prove, at least, that I was implanted. If they were cartilage or keloids, they would not be delivering sounds and buzzing sensations through them. I ask the reader to suspend disbelief, until they’ve read the whole document. hank you for reading.</b></p>
<p>My daughter was born, in Oct of 2004, delivered via C-section. The very next month, I and my daughter both had surgeries. She had a surgery for pyloric stenosis, and I had one for cervical dysplasia. Both of us were put under general anesthetic. I have since had flashbacks of something very terrible being done to me in my privates, causing a constant physical pain that came out in Sept of 2008, in the form of <b>vulvodynia, a disease marked by constant vaginal pain and contractions</b>, <b>often caused by previous</b>  <b>trauma</b> in the area. When I describe my symptoms to people, some people believe it is <b>demons</b> doing it to me. That being said, in 2010, I had a memory resurface of the doctor (replete with surgical mask) doing something to my privates with a loud (“whirring sounding”) instrument, during which I could hear my own mother speaking to me, and I could hear my own screams. The fact that I could hear my own screams tells me this is a “<b>flashback</b>”, of a memory of an event that my mind had to repress to keep me sane. The fact that my mother was involved in this procedure, and in my flashback, I can clearly hear her telling me, “what a great hero you’re being for your country”, combined with the fact that my mother is now dead, tells me that they not only did something terrible to me, but that they might have killed her so that she would not be able to be questioned. The procedure was done by my OB/GYN, Romeo Acosta. I have been in constant pain in the area for around four years now. The pain itself is traumatic.</p>
<p>In May of 2008, I discovered implants, located just in front of each ear. I have no idea how long they’ve been there. I had an oral surgery in 1984 under a general anesthetic, and I had an oral surgery in 2001 or 2002 (I’m not sure of the date), under a general anesthetic. Although it could have happened when I was adopted and held by the Catholic agency (that has since been indicted on <b>child-trafficking </b>charges) for about 6 weeks before my family got me, even though they had my birthmother set up with my adoptive mother long before I was born.</p>

<div class="mceTemp"></div>
<p>Considering the fact that I never felt pain in the locations of these implants after any surgery, I am forced to assume that they were put in before I can remember. I now hear voices through them and I have buzzing and painful sensations coming through them. As you can see from this image, they are not visible until I gently pull back on my ear, but they are definitely there. It was maybe a few months before I discovered the implants that I began to hear voices. At first, I heard a voice telling me to “purge”, as if referring to memories that were coming back to me, at that time. I also was made to believe that some of the voices were angels and that one of them was God. These voices communicated all manner of things to me, making me appear schizophrenic, so that I would be easily discredited (but I was suspiciously denied for social security disability despite the fact that I was given schizophrenic meds by the free clinic). The fact that I have these two lumps in my head cast a reasonable doubt on the idea that I may be schizophrenic. Also casting doubt on the schizophrenia diagnosis is the fact that the lithium and other meds I was given actually made the voices get worse.</p>
<p>At the end of August, 2008, I was left in a foreclosed home with no power or water, when my boyfriend left with our daughter. This happened as a result of me hearing voices and following their commands, thus appearing crazy. At that time, the voices coming through the implants, I didn’t yet know about, were telling me that my real family was coming to find me, prompting me to go around looking for them. Well, they lied, but this made me look nuts. In early September of the same year, I found myself in the worst pain I had ever experienced in my life. While in this constant pain, I stayed in that house for about 2.5 years, in the worst heat and, at times, in freezing temperatures. I had no vehicle and had no way of getting around, in order to try to get a job. During that time these voices, coming through the implants, told me that certain people, in my life were causing my pain. This made me send very negative energies at these people. Also during that time, in the worst heat of summer, a police helicopter woke me up at 2:30am, flying in a circular pattern, around that house, shining the spotlight into the windows for over a half an hour, which was traumatizing to say the least. <b>During this helicopter trauma, no police vehicle came to the house, which makes the entire event suspect of someone trying to traumatize me on purpose.</b></p>
<p>While my boyfriend had a decent excuse for leaving, and for trying to have me locked up 3 times, thereby costing me the one job I ever truly loved in my life, his treatment of me during that time was downright cruel at times. For example, when he left, he promised to leave me with one of our two vehicles, but he ended up taking it instead. Also, there was one time, within the year after he had left, and I had no job at that point, and I was alone in pain, unable to walk much, and without a vehicle, trying to work with crystals to heal myself, I had no money and no way to get food. I ended up having to sell some of his tools. He busted in the door and yelled at me. He went to smash my crystals, and I tried to stop him by putting my arms between his hands and my crystals. He then grabbed me by the arms and threw me on the floor. This happened three times, and on the 3<sup>rd</sup> time, I hit the chair first. Then he grabbed my cell phone, ran out the front door, shutting it behind him &amp; held it closed while he called the cops to accuse me of domestic violence. HE LIED, &amp; I’M PRETTY SURE THAT COP KNOWS IT. This man is 6’3” tall and is almost twice my size, in weight and stature combined. There is no way I could ever physically harm or abuse him. I mean, come on now!</p>
<p>Most people are aware that the <b>Catholic Church has been indicted on child-trafficking charges, in connection to satanic ritual abuse</b>. I was adopted through Catholic Charities, which also has some record of being involved in child-trafficking. Many people are aware of the existence of <b>ritual abuse and mind control</b>, especially that which has been uncovered, during the 1977 MK Ultra Senate Hearings, to have occurred in the 50s and 60s, to witting and unwitting victims. In those hearings, it was discovered that many files of these horrendous experiments were destroyed. While it has been stated that these secret programs ended at least 12 years prior to the 1977 hearings, the fact that they were secret in the first place, leads me to believe that other programs continued after the one known as <b>MK Ultra</b> had ended. The experts involved in this and other secret programs were often Nazi scientists brought into our country, under what is known as “<b>Project Paperclip</b>”. Some such “experts” include Joseph Mengele, Ewen Cameron, and Jose Delgado. Many of the Nazi scientists were experts in the <b>occult</b>. Other mind control programs that are documented include: <b>Project Naomi, Project Artichoke, Project Monarch, and Project Delta. </b>A common practice involved in these mind control programs was to use adopted children and children from orphanages. Most experts on mind control know about the use of occult symbolism.</p>
<p>Beyond typical mind control and ritual abuse, involving a <b>drowning at 3y/o</b> (which is common to ritual abuse survivors), I have been unknowingly, unwittingly living under an occult curse my entire life. I only became aware of it within the past four years, when I discovered the Thoth tarot deck and its’ uncanny connection to my life, as noted in the e-books, “<b>Meta Crime</b>”, and “<b>Symbolism, Mind Control, and Metaphysical Sabotage in Relation to Archetypal Transference and the Second Commandment of the Decalogue</b>”. This curse is tied to my birthdate with the 12<sup>th</sup> trump of the tarot, which, in almost every single deck (of which there are over a thousand in print today), is an upside-down figure. In at least three different decks, there is a serpent close to the victim’s head, or attached to it with rays. I have read a document entitled, “Project Monarch – Nazi Mind Control”, on the internet, which states: “One of the earliest writings giving reference to occultism is the <b>Egyptian Book of the Dead</b>, a compilation of rituals explicitly describing methods of torture and intimidation (to create trauma), the use of potions (drugs) and the casting of spells (hypnotism), ultimately resulting in the total enslavement of the initiate. These have been the main ingredients for a part of occultism known as <b>Satanism</b>, throughout the ages.” In the Crowley Thoth deck (Thoth is the Egyptian God mostly associated with magic, writing, science, and judgment of the dead) the serpent either represents Satan himself, or it represents the so-called “<b>serpent class</b>”, who are adepts at the occult. Also in at least three different decks, is an upside-down <b>ankh</b>, which is the Egyptian symbol for life and fertility, a symbol that closely resembles the currently accepted sign of female. For some reason, I was always very attached to the symbol of the Ankh, while never knowing what symbolism meant. The 12<sup>th</sup> trump card is a <b>graven image</b> in the respect that it is an image of suffering and/or death. This curse has made it impossible for me to live a normal life, or have any true freewill, because I have been metaphorically upside-down or reversed throughout my entire life. The reversed nature of the card, and especially of the upside-down ankh in the 12<sup>th</sup> trump of at least three decks of the tarot, has caused that reversed vibration to manifest itself in my life, in the following ways:</p>
<p>1)      I was naturally left handed, but the person teaching me to write made me be right handed, by telling me that left-handedness is evil. I was a small child when this happened, but over time, it had the effect of helping to make me a very negative person.</p>
<p>2)      My mother named me with initials that spelled the word for a specific animal, <b>dehumanizing</b> me. Later, she would tell me, “I don’t know why I named you that, I don’t even like cats”.</p>
<p>3)      My mother constantly put me down, bullied me, called me names, and held other people’s children over her own, comparing me to my cousins, my friends, often telling me that I was no good and that I would “never amount to anything”.</p>
<p>4)      My mother (born on 4/4 which corresponds to the 4<sup>th</sup> trump, the Emperor card) had way too much power to be raising someone in such a prone position, as what is displayed on the 12th trump. This card, backed with some sort of occult intent to make a living sacrifice on a metaphysical level, created an energy of powerlessness. The voices coming through those implants tell me that I am to be a ritual blood sacrifice.</p>
<p>5)      The television (tell-a-vision) was my primary babysitter. I was left alone in my childhood, and was even allowed to play alone in the woods at 6 and 7 years old. Anything could’ve happened back then (including being implanted), since I have memories of going to the woods, memories of playing in the woods, but no memories of coming home. Doesn’t that seem strange to anyone besides me?</p>
<p>6)      My mother smoked 3 packs of cigarettes daily, exposing me, because they did not know the impact of second hand smoke on a baby back then, which addicted me to nicotine at a very early age, and caused me to have asthma.</p>
<p>7)      My brother often enjoyed terrorizing me. One such example I can cite is of him wrapping me up in a blanket and tossing me down the stairs. When I got to the bottom of those stairs, I pushed the blanket off of me, and saw my parents laughing at me.</p>
<p>Regarding other accusations about things I may or may not have done in my lifetime: Anything I am actually guilty of is <b>directly attributable</b> to the <b>occult curse</b> I have been living under throughout my life. However, I have done comparably little evil in this world, when compared to what has been done to me. Considering the fact that I have implants in my head, that are easily provable, there is no telling how long I have been subliminally affected by them, or what the voices coming through them have said to me in my sleep. Yet, I’ve never gone out and killed anyone, and I never will.</p>
<p><b>That being said, the following is a list of accusations and responses to them:</b></p>
<p>1)      I have been accused of not sharing, but if one considers how my whole life was orchestrated and my inspiration was stolen from me via the serpent class, as represented by the snake at the head of the victim in the 12<sup>th</sup> trump of the <b>Thoth</b>, <b>Ludovica</b>, and<b> Hermetic</b> tarot decks, then it would stand to reason that I would have a subconscious need to hold onto things, as a security issue, given that I was subconsciously seeing my own creative ideas being stolen. For example, artistic ideas were stolen from me (C.A.T.) by people like M.J. Skinner (“skin the cat”). That being said, let it be known that when I saw others who were truly in need, even when I was myself living in substandard conditions, I still shared what I had. Please see my document entitled, “<b>Metaphysical Sabotage</b>”.</p>
<p>2)      I have been accused of being a pedophile ….   This is simply ridiculous and doesn’t even deserve a response, but the answer is: NO, I AM NOT A PEDOPHILE, NOR HAVE I EVER KISSED OR DONE ANYTHING REMOTELY SEXUAL WITH ANYONE UNDER AGE,. HOWEVER, I MYSELF WAS DATE-RAPED, WHEN I WAS 16 Y/O, BY A 21 Y/O, AND IT WAS MY VERY FIRST EXPERIENCE OF INTERCOURSE. I NEVER PROSECUTED HIM.</p>
<p>3)      I have been accused of being a racist ….  Never in my life have I ever been racist, nor have I ever discriminated on the basis of anything. In fact, even as a child, I always showed the utmost respect for oppressed races and cultures.</p>
<p>4)      I have been accused of being a baby killer. While I deeply regret having two abortions, I had no parents around raising me, and as a result, I ended up following much of what those around me believed, especially the males, because I sorely lacked a father figure in my life. At one point, I ended up with a boyfriend who as prochoice and exposed me to the book called “Our Bodies Ourselves”, which approved of abortion. Unbeknownst to me, my subconscious was having a strong influence in my life, and had me always seeking out a daddy. In my late teens and early twenties (and even into my 30s), I was easily influenced by every boyfriend I had.</p>
<p>5)      I have been accused of being lazy. Up until I found myself in excruciating pain, I have always taken relatively good care of my home, until I found myself simultaneously working, taking care of a toddler, and trying to keep house from 2005 until 2008.</p>
<p>6)      I have been accused of being a whore, which I am most certainly not. There have been short moments in my life, when I was forced to live like one, like when I was living in the streets, but I am not one, and have not truly ever been one.</p>
<p>7)      I was a latchkey kid from 9y/o until I moved out, even though my mother didn’t have to work during that time, at all.</p>
<p>8)      As previously discussed, I have been living under an occult curse my entire life, as a result of my birthdate in relation to the 12<sup>th</sup> trump of the Thoth tarot, with the upside-down ankh (the Egyptian symbol for life &amp; fertility), with my mother being the 4<sup>th</sup> trump, allowing her way too much power over me.</p>
<p>9)      I have been accused of being a narcissist … I spent half my childhood in a house of mirrors, with a narcissist mother, in which there was a completely mirrored coffee table, the closet doors were mirrored, the bedroom sets were mirrored, and even the wallpaper was mirrored. Can you say PSYOPS? What does growing up in a house of mirrors do to a child anyway? So I probably WAS one, but I am not one now. For info on the role mirrors play in mind control, please see the following: <a href="http://www.theforbiddenknowledge.com/hardtruth/mind_control_art.htm">http://www.theforbiddenknowledge.com/hardtruth/mind_control_art.htm</a></p>
<p>For more info on general mind control programming, including the use of mirrors, see the Fritz Springmeier and Cisco Wheeler document about &#8220;Undetectable Mind Controlled Slaves&#8221;, here: <a href="http://www.emhdf.com/Monarch-mind-control.pdf">http://www.emhdf.com/Monarch-mind-control.pdf</a></p>
<p>10)   I have been accused of being “cruel” …  well, I couldn’t have possibly been as cruel to my child as the catholic church has been to me, by holding me in custody for the first 6 weeks of my life (with no parental bonding), or by allowing some agency to put implants in my head. There was a time, when I was in my late teens or early twenties when this guy named Bob punched me and threw me into a sliding glass door. I retaliated after being goaded by his own friends. I am not proud of what I did. I painted his member red. Even to this day, when I have repented of it to people I know, I was told it was “funny” not “horrible”, and that he deserved it for hitting a woman. However, I sincerely regret it.</p>
<p>11)   If the accusation is in relation to me name calling or being a bully when I was younger… well, my parents were bullies to me (mom called me stupid, while dad called me fat). Growing up, my friends made up names for others, and so did I. “When in Rome, etc.” I think this is where that came from, but I changed. For example, there was a teacher in my school named Emma Mosteller, and my friend, Lucianne, made up the name, “Enima Molester”. I subsequently called my friend “Lusty Anus”. I am not proud of it, but I was following a pattern. Considering the fact that I was metaphorically upside-down, it should come as no surprise.</p>
<p>12)   I have been told that “you snooze you lose”, regarding the fact that, after I lost my job, finding myself in horrible, nightmarish pain, with no vehicle, no place to go, and living in a foreclosed house with no power or water, it took me over three years to begin writing about my experiences in any coherent way. I had virtually no access to a computer, so I was unable to learn much of anything in relation to the curse, or anything else for that matter. When I was able to get to a library, I found many books unavailable. I contend that I was not snoozing, rather, I was cut off from every outlet to state my case for forgiveness, once I began to learn of the metaphysical curse I had been living under throughout my life. Also, I was in a state of constant traumatic pain and hearing voices through these implants, which I sometimes want to call “headphones”. Even friends and neighbors would rarely let me use their computers to get online, so I was unable to post my experiences. When I was able to get online, I was hit with either (at neighbor&#8217;s house) someone talking in my face during the whole time, which distracted me, or (at library) I would be inundated with various voices throwing me off track, or scaring me into leaving with threats. Wherever I went for help regarding my specific problem, I was not able to get adequate treatment, which I sincerely hope will change soon. Whoever is responsible for the ongoing Traumatic Stress Disorder should have to face some consequences for their actions, because its goal seems to be just to make me appear insane, or to actually drive me insane, but it seems like there is some agency that does not truly want me to get help, or recover.</p>
<p>13)   I have been accused of being a liar … Honestly, when I was younger, I did make things up to try to get attention from my parents, because they were simply absent during my childhood, but I did change. In fact, I made the conscious effort to change because I did not like getting attention that way, and I didn&#8217;t want to be a liar. At the risk of being labeled a liar by my accusers/gang-stalkers, I am being honest about my past. At one point, after discovering what was happening to me, I believed that one of my doctors (OB/GYN) might have been named Delgado, but I have since researched my personal files, and realized that neither one of them had that name. <i>This tells me that these verifiable implants have been used to enforce the idea that I had a doctor named Delgado, just so someone could then paint me as a liar</i>. While it is possible I had an oral surgeon by that name, I cannot verify the name of the last oral surgeon I had, who was in St. Petersburg, FL. The first oral surgeon I had was named Castellano, and was in Tampa. Regardless of what doctor put the implants in, and what doctor did the horrifying procedure to my privates, the flashback and the pain are absolutely real. <b>I have no doubt that trauma occurred in my privates to cause it, but of course, no one wants to believe it, or give me a true exam, or even give me pain medication for it. </b>The trauma to my privates has caused the condition noted above called vulvodynia, which is a constant pain in the area, usually caused by a<b> previous trauma to the area</b>.</p>
<p>14)   I have been called a “user” … I honestly do not want to be disabled, not in the least. I have always worked very hard for my money, and in most job I’ve held, I was always the top performer. However, I am suffering from severe PTSD due to the horrible and evil events that happened to me. The obvious implants, that are located in front of each ear, may have subliminally influenced me the whole time they have been in place. For all I know, they may have been sending me subliminal messages during my sleep to make me psychologically unwell.</p>
<p>What was done to me, throughout my life, violated every law imaginable at the time of my adoption. From what I understand, back in the 60s, it was illegal to put implants in a child&#8217;s ears, and mind control was illegal. These days, it seems to be the norm, as I can see and hear it in the music, movies, and television. Since the patriot virtually repealed every human right we had in our constitution, those who wish to subvert human rights seem to have been given carte blanche to do so.</p>
<p>If there is an honorable attorney out there, who recognizes that at the very least, that I should be grandfathered in to being able to sue those responsible for my implants, due to the date of implantation, I would love to hear from one. I have read that one can find the manufacturer of an implant by examining it under a microscope.</p>
<p>I believe I was sold into slavery, to be a part of some horrible macabre experiment, designed to influence me in a subliminal and insidious way, to do things against my true nature and freewill. I hope those who are inflicting this &#8220;soft-kill/no-touch torture&#8221;, as well as that those who put the implants in my ears are someday held liable for their actions, for what they are doing and have done to me is the most heinous crime I could&#8217;ve ever thought possible.</p>
<p>I pray every day that someone can help me. I am living in what I can only describe as a mental concentration camp.</p>
