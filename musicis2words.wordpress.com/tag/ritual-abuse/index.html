<p><strong>Trauma</strong>, in itself, might be livable, but when combined with <strong>negative reinforcement</strong>, the results should be obvious.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of my own traumas in childhood, which I feel, combined with other mind control methods (such as TV, music, &amp; movies), contributed to my suggestibility throughout my life:</p>
<p>-Adoptee Trauma (causes separation anxiety, attachment disorder, and is often cited as a cause for borderline personality disorder):</p>
<p><a href="http://www.originsnsw.com/mentalhealth/id4.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.originsnsw.com/mentalhealth/id4.html</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.mentalhelp.net/poc/view_doc.php?type=doc&#038;id=27633" rel="nofollow">http://www.mentalhelp.net/poc/view_doc.php?type=doc&#038;id=27633</a></p>
<p>-Mother uses method of allowing baby to scream until she passes out in the crib. I remember climbing out of the crib, at one point, &amp; falling on the tile floor.</p>
<p>-Mother named me with initials that spell &#8220;cat&#8221;, even though she didn&#8217;t even like cats, which she told me.</p>
<p>&#8211;<strong>Drowning</strong> at 3y/o, which is common to <strong>ritual abuse</strong> victims.</p>
<p>-Being made to write right-handed, against my natural inclination to be left-handed, throwing the brain off its natural balance, making a person even more suggestible.</p>
<p>-Lack of parental role models (father always away on business trips &amp; mother simply away), which primes a person to be suggestible, by making a female victim seek out the missing <strong>father figure</strong> in her boyfriends. Once found, the female victim will then believe whatever this &#8220;father figure&#8221; boyfriend tells them, because she has no <strong>foundational values</strong> from her parents.</p>
<p>&#8211;<strong>Neglect</strong> and <strong>verbal abuse</strong> from parents is negative reinforcement which has negative effects on any child. Father made fun of me for being slightly overweight, &amp; made up songs about being fat. Mother consistently compared me to relatives &amp; friends, &amp; would often tell me &#8220;you are stupid, stupid, stupid, and you&#8217;re never going to amount to anything&#8221;, which became a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>
<p>-Television was main babysitter.</p>
<p>-Allowed to play in the woods alone at 6 &amp; 7 years old.</p>
<p>-Being allowed to watch movies like &#8220;Rosemary&#8217;s Baby&#8221;, &#8220;The Omen&#8221;, &amp; &#8220;The Exorcist&#8221;, before the age of 7.</p>
<p>-Physical abuse from brother. Ex: He wrapped me up in a blanket &amp; pushed down the stairs. I must&#8217;ve been about 4 or 5, since my head didn&#8217;t hit the bannister &amp; my feet didn&#8217;t touch the wall. Got to the bottom to find my parents standing over me, pointing their fingers &amp; laughing at me.</p>
<p>-2nd drowning at 12y/o.</p>
<p>-Mother had me selling hotdogs in a bikini at construction sites at 14y/o.</p>
<p>-Raped at 16y/o by a 21y/o male friend of my mother&#8217;s.</p>
<p>-Railroaded into making a false confession at 17y/o, when someone supposedly stole my mother&#8217;s wallet (years later, I would find out she was a heavy gambler). The cops/detectives in that case weren&#8217;t really interested in finding the truth, they just wanted to close the case. They knew at 17y/o, I didn&#8217;t know my rights, &amp; told me that if I didn&#8217;t confess, they would throw me in jail.</p>
<p>Trauma, mixed with neglect, television, &amp; implants (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74Os-iN9J0Q" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74Os-iN9J0Q</a>) combine to make mind control a breeze for the handler(s). Implants, possibly used during sleep, allows for post hypnotic suggestion, making the victim a virtual puppet by removing freewill.</p>
<p>The trauma I suffered, along with neglect and verbal abuse, forced me into a situation of reacting to negative programming, put in place at a young age.</p>
<p>I continue to write about this in the hopes that someone will see why what is happening to me is absolutely wrong &amp; not my fault. When a person&#8217;s <strong>freewill</strong> is taken away from them with programming on so many levels, that person cannot be blamed for reacting to it.</p>
<p>It seems very sad that things got so bad for me at a time when I was actively trying to become a more positive person in my life. I wish that God, the true, just, &amp; merciful <strong>God</strong>, would see the truth of what happened in my life, &amp; how some outside party took my freewill away from me, forcing me to be negative.</p>
<p>The following links address negative reinforcement as a <strong>self-fulfilling prophecy</strong>:<br />

<p>The link above completely explains how a child that originally had a high IQ in gradeschool ended up lucky to graduate highschool with a C average. This is why I make an effort to tell my child she is smart, and have done so since she was a baby. While I am grateful that I have learned, apophatically, about how to be a decent parent, I am saddened by the fact that the life I was supposed to have was stolen from me through these negative types of <strong>programming</strong>.</p>
<p>Now, I want to list some of the traumas that happened to me as an adult:</p>
<p>-Had a surgery for cervical dysplasia in 2004, wherein I was under a general anesthetic and something terrible happened to me, of which I had a flashback in 2010. This caused a condition known as vulvodynia, which involves a delayed onset of pain resulting from trauma to the area. This pain started in 2008.</p>
<p>-I discovered implants in each ear in 2008, not long before that pain began, and also in the same year, I began to hear voices.</p>
<p>-My boyfriend &amp; father of our daughter, tried to have me locked up twice, which cost me my job.</p>
<p>-He left me in the house he forced us to move into, taking our daughter. I had begged him not to buy this house because the house payment would be about 3 times the rent we were paying (it was the height of the housing bubble in 2005). I wanted to just move out of the neighborhood, into an apartment, until the housing market bubble burst.</p>
<p>-Two weeks after he left, my pain started. It was and is traumatic, especially given its location. It feels like my crotch is being electrocuted.</p>
<p>-He said he’d leave one of our two cars with me, but took both anyway. Being in this kind of constant pain made it difficult for me to walk, much less go find a new job.</p>
<p>-He came busting into the house saying he had a dream I was selling the tools he left there. Given what he did to me, and my condition, I really didn’t have a choice. He tried to smash some of my things, and I tried to stop him. At this point, he grabbed me and threw me on the floor. This happened a total of 3 times, and on the third time, I hit the chair on my way down to the floor. Then he grabbed my cell phone, ran out the front door, stood up against the door so I couldn’t get out, and he called the cops on me for domestic violence. The man is literally twice my size. He does have a record of domestic violence with an ex-girlfriend.</p>
<p>-Not long after that event, the power went off, then the water, and finally garbage service. I was stuck, in horrible, traumatic pain, in the worst heat, which was an additional psychological trauma. I washed my hair in rain water that I collected in storage bins, and I cooked food on a gutted toaster oven, inside which I put fire. When winter came, I would have as many candles lit as I could, to keep the room a bit less cold. I lived like this for over 2 years.</p>
<p>-At one point, a police helicopter flew around the house, at around 2:30 AM, for about a half an hour, with its spotlight shining in the windows. I found the middle point of the house and crouched down there. What is odd about this is the fact that no cop car showed up during this time, which tells me that it was done just to traumatize me.</p>
<p>-He went around the neighborhood, talking to neighbors about me behind my back.</p>
<p>-He put a lock on the mailbox, and used a saw to cut a slit in it. This allowed postal workers to deliver mail, but I was unable to retrieve it.</p>

		<h3 class="result"><a href="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2012/12/19/this-is-a-bill/" rel="bookmark">THIS IS A&nbsp;BILL</a></h3>					<p><b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">THIS IS A BILL</span></b></p>
<p>I am owed, by parties cited below (and possibly others not cited below), my life, health, freedom, wellbeing, freewill, and indeed, my very soul, back from all parties involved in the placement of my personal property (myself) into an experimental mind control program, <em>without my consent</em>, that involved the use of RFID-sized implants in my ears, which served to change me from the person I was born to be.</p>
<p>My<b> HUMAN RIGHTS WERE VIOLATED. </b>While there is no amount of money that can recoup my loss or replace what has been stolen from me, I deserve at least that from those involved. I did not consent to be taken from my birthmother, or placed into an experimental program involving the use of <em>implants</em> (see photos below), therefore I am owed all those things above, plus the amount of 5 million dollars for mental anguish, loss of livelihood/employability, for <strong>all</strong> bills acquired by me, which are a direct result of my being influenced by these implants.</p>
<p>Since I can feel both sides of each implant, they obviously go directly through the cartilage of my ears, and it cannot be doubted that they are unnatural foreign objects, and not, as some would say, keloid scars or cutaneous horns. Their size is the same as that of<b> RFID implants. </b>Given the sensations I experience and have experienced through them, I must conclude they are some form of microchip or RFID chip.</p>

<p><b>                                            </b></p>
<p><b>This bill is directed to, but not limited to, the following participating parties:</b></p>
<p>Catholic Charities for possibly stealing me from my natural parents, for holding me in their custody for the first 6 weeks of my life, causing an <strong>attachment disorder</strong>, and for placing me in a family, solely because they had money (upper middle class in the late 60s) but were not necessarily meant to raise more children. I was often left alone, neglected, verbally and sometimes physically abused, and was given television as a main baby sitter. I had a near drowning at 3y/o. I was allowed to play alone in the woods at 6 years old and beyond. I spent the latter half of my childhood in a literal house of mirrors. The use of <strong>mirrors in mind control</strong> is a heavily documented subject, and drownings at the age of 3 are often cited in <strong>ritual abuse</strong> cases.</p>
<p>Whatever company or entity manufactured the RFID chips that are in my ears.</p>
<p>Whatever doctor or entity implanted those chips into my ears.</p>
<p>Whatever agency, group, company, entity, or human being that authorized the placement of those chips into my ears.</p>
<p>Whatever agency, group, company, entity, or human being that utilized the implanted RFID chips for whatever experiment I was involved in, past, present, or future.</p>
<p>Whatever group, company, entity, or human being who profited from the placement of said implants.</p>
<p>Whatever group, company, entity, or human being who profited from the suffering endured by me as a result of the placement of me in any experimental program, including any program that involved the use of any implanted chips on my body.</p>
<p><strong>Here is a short explanation of what I have been through as a result of what was done to me:</strong></p>
<p>I was born in the late 60s, after <strong>Dr. Jose Delgado</strong> had begun working on <em>brain stimulation</em> with implants in the heads of rats, cats, dogs, and even a bull. He was able to “<strong>play animals like instruments</strong>”. This research was begun in the early 50s, at least 15 years before I was born. This technology has positive aspects in the ability to improve the quality of life for many people who are disabled, but it obviously fell into the wrong hands, because it had powerful, far-reaching, negative effects on my quality of life and on my emotional wellbeing.</p>
<p>Since I have never felt pain in the sites of these implants, I am forced to conclude that they have been with me since birth. Since I was held in custody of the adoption agency for the first 6 weeks of my life, it seems logical to think that it was most likely done during the period between 12/12/1967 and 1/22/1968. If they were implanted during that time, they may have been used to “play me” in the same way that Dr. Delgado’s animals were “played”. <em>This means that various parts of my brain were possibly stimulated to make me depressed, sad, lonely, apathetic, emotionally disturbed, causing me to make very bad decisions in life, and to eventually become a drug addict, so that I would be easily labeled and discredited</em>. I am no longer a drug addict, but have been left with emotional <strong>trauma</strong> that I cannot heal.</p>
<p>It must be noted that, when these “chips” were implanted in my head, it was <strong>WITHOUT MY CONSENT</strong>, AND it was most certainly <strong>NOT LEGAL</strong> to do so. Even if they were somehow implanted into my head during my last surgery in November of 2004 (and I am not saying they were), it was still NOT LEGAL to do so without my consent. That being said, I never felt pain in the sites of the implants after that surgery in 2004, or after any surgery I have ever had, which is why I believe it was done to me as an infant, which is reprehensible.</p>
<p>I am not necessarily blaming my adoptive parents because I do not know how much they knew about my having implants (although I do suspect some knowledge on the part of my father), they could have just been following the pattern they grew up with. I am not blaming my adoptive brother, because I know how he was treated when he lived in the house with us, although he did do a number of things that were frightening, to say the least.</p>
<p>The combination of childhood neglect and abuse, having TV as a main babysitter (flicker-rate/refresh-rate hypnosis), and being implanted with <strong>RFID chips</strong> in each ear, which have been influencing me on a <strong>subliminal</strong> level throughout my life, thereby removing a large portion of my freewill, have prohibited me from reaching my true potential &amp; have stolen the person I was meant to be from me. This is nothing to say of the effects of <em>flicker-rate hypnosis</em> &amp; <em>post hypnotic suggestion</em>.</p>
<p>All that would be needed to determine the responsible parties would be to remove at least one implant and find a serial number from it. This would allow me to track down the manufacturer and who they sold it to. <strong>IF I DIE</strong> before I am able to do this, I ask for an <strong>AUTOPSY</strong> to be performed, to remove these implants, and track down the manufacturer. I am asking for this because my quality of life has severely declined over the past few years, since I became a target for what is now being called &#8220;<strong>soft kill</strong>&#8220;, &#8220;<strong>slow kill</strong>&#8220;, and &#8220;<strong>no-touch torture</strong>&#8220;, and I am concerned about how much time I have left. I suffer all the symptoms of other <strong>targeted indiviuals</strong>.</p>
<p>I have been <strong>VIOLATED</strong> on a level that is difficult to quantify, but I am trying my best to put it into words.</p>
<p>By the way, I was not born into this world, to be ripped off by the collective, and given next to nothing in return. Those who were &amp; are involved in doing this to me will be damned as they have damned me. Period. End of story.</p>

<p><b>Some people will say I am playing the victim, but I assure you that this is not by choice. </b></p>
<p><b>Some people will say I am lying, but you cannot make this stuff up, and I have photos that prove, at least, that I was implanted. If they were cartilage or keloids, they would not be delivering sounds and buzzing sensations through them. I ask the reader to suspend disbelief, until they’ve read the whole document. hank you for reading.</b></p>
<p>My daughter was born, in Oct of 2004, delivered via C-section. The very next month, I and my daughter both had surgeries. She had a surgery for pyloric stenosis, and I had one for cervical dysplasia. Both of us were put under general anesthetic. I have since had flashbacks of something very terrible being done to me in my privates, causing a constant physical pain that came out in Sept of 2008, in the form of <b>vulvodynia, a disease marked by constant vaginal pain and contractions</b>, <b>often caused by previous</b>  <b>trauma</b> in the area. When I describe my symptoms to people, some people believe it is <b>demons</b> doing it to me. That being said, in 2010, I had a memory resurface of the doctor (replete with surgical mask) doing something to my privates with a loud (“whirring sounding”) instrument, during which I could hear my own mother speaking to me, and I could hear my own screams. The fact that I could hear my own screams tells me this is a “<b>flashback</b>”, of a memory of an event that my mind had to repress to keep me sane. The fact that my mother was involved in this procedure, and in my flashback, I can clearly hear her telling me, “what a great hero you’re being for your country”, combined with the fact that my mother is now dead, tells me that they not only did something terrible to me, but that they might have killed her so that she would not be able to be questioned. The procedure was done by my OB/GYN, Romeo Acosta. I have been in constant pain in the area for around four years now. The pain itself is traumatic.</p>
<p>In May of 2008, I discovered implants, located just in front of each ear. I have no idea how long they’ve been there. I had an oral surgery in 1984 under a general anesthetic, and I had an oral surgery in 2001 or 2002 (I’m not sure of the date), under a general anesthetic. Although it could have happened when I was adopted and held by the Catholic agency (that has since been indicted on <b>child-trafficking </b>charges) for about 6 weeks before my family got me, even though they had my birthmother set up with my adoptive mother long before I was born.</p>

<div class="mceTemp"></div>
<p>Considering the fact that I never felt pain in the locations of these implants after any surgery, I am forced to assume that they were put in before I can remember. I now hear voices through them and I have buzzing and painful sensations coming through them. As you can see from this image, they are not visible until I gently pull back on my ear, but they are definitely there. It was maybe a few months before I discovered the implants that I began to hear voices. At first, I heard a voice telling me to “purge”, as if referring to memories that were coming back to me, at that time. I also was made to believe that some of the voices were angels and that one of them was God. These voices communicated all manner of things to me, making me appear schizophrenic, so that I would be easily discredited (but I was suspiciously denied for social security disability despite the fact that I was given schizophrenic meds by the free clinic). The fact that I have these two lumps in my head cast a reasonable doubt on the idea that I may be schizophrenic. Also casting doubt on the schizophrenia diagnosis is the fact that the lithium and other meds I was given actually made the voices get worse.</p>
<p>At the end of August, 2008, I was left in a foreclosed home with no power or water, when my boyfriend left with our daughter. This happened as a result of me hearing voices and following their commands, thus appearing crazy. At that time, the voices coming through the implants, I didn’t yet know about, were telling me that my real family was coming to find me, prompting me to go around looking for them. Well, they lied, but this made me look nuts. In early September of the same year, I found myself in the worst pain I had ever experienced in my life. While in this constant pain, I stayed in that house for about 2.5 years, in the worst heat and, at times, in freezing temperatures. I had no vehicle and had no way of getting around, in order to try to get a job. During that time these voices, coming through the implants, told me that certain people, in my life were causing my pain. This made me send very negative energies at these people. Also during that time, in the worst heat of summer, a police helicopter woke me up at 2:30am, flying in a circular pattern, around that house, shining the spotlight into the windows for over a half an hour, which was traumatizing to say the least. <b>During this helicopter trauma, no police vehicle came to the house, which makes the entire event suspect of someone trying to traumatize me on purpose.</b></p>
<p>While my boyfriend had a decent excuse for leaving, and for trying to have me locked up 3 times, thereby costing me the one job I ever truly loved in my life, his treatment of me during that time was downright cruel at times. For example, when he left, he promised to leave me with one of our two vehicles, but he ended up taking it instead. Also, there was one time, within the year after he had left, and I had no job at that point, and I was alone in pain, unable to walk much, and without a vehicle, trying to work with crystals to heal myself, I had no money and no way to get food. I ended up having to sell some of his tools. He busted in the door and yelled at me. He went to smash my crystals, and I tried to stop him by putting my arms between his hands and my crystals. He then grabbed me by the arms and threw me on the floor. This happened three times, and on the 3<sup>rd</sup> time, I hit the chair first. Then he grabbed my cell phone, ran out the front door, shutting it behind him &amp; held it closed while he called the cops to accuse me of domestic violence. HE LIED, &amp; I’M PRETTY SURE THAT COP KNOWS IT. This man is 6’3” tall and is almost twice my size, in weight and stature combined. There is no way I could ever physically harm or abuse him. I mean, come on now!</p>
<p>Most people are aware that the <b>Catholic Church has been indicted on child-trafficking charges, in connection to satanic ritual abuse</b>. I was adopted through Catholic Charities, which also has some record of being involved in child-trafficking. Many people are aware of the existence of <b>ritual abuse and mind control</b>, especially that which has been uncovered, during the 1977 MK Ultra Senate Hearings, to have occurred in the 50s and 60s, to witting and unwitting victims. In those hearings, it was discovered that many files of these horrendous experiments were destroyed. While it has been stated that these secret programs ended at least 12 years prior to the 1977 hearings, the fact that they were secret in the first place, leads me to believe that other programs continued after the one known as <b>MK Ultra</b> had ended. The experts involved in this and other secret programs were often Nazi scientists brought into our country, under what is known as “<b>Project Paperclip</b>”. Some such “experts” include Joseph Mengele, Ewen Cameron, and Jose Delgado. Many of the Nazi scientists were experts in the <b>occult</b>. Other mind control programs that are documented include: <b>Project Naomi, Project Artichoke, Project Monarch, and Project Delta. </b>A common practice involved in these mind control programs was to use adopted children and children from orphanages. Most experts on mind control know about the use of occult symbolism.</p>
<p>Beyond typical mind control and ritual abuse, involving a <b>drowning at 3y/o</b> (which is common to ritual abuse survivors), I have been unknowingly, unwittingly living under an occult curse my entire life. I only became aware of it within the past four years, when I discovered the Thoth tarot deck and its’ uncanny connection to my life, as noted in the e-books, “<b>Meta Crime</b>”, and “<b>Symbolism, Mind Control, and Metaphysical Sabotage in Relation to Archetypal Transference and the Second Commandment of the Decalogue</b>”. This curse is tied to my birthdate with the 12<sup>th</sup> trump of the tarot, which, in almost every single deck (of which there are over a thousand in print today), is an upside-down figure. In at least three different decks, there is a serpent close to the victim’s head, or attached to it with rays. I have read a document entitled, “Project Monarch – Nazi Mind Control”, on the internet, which states: “One of the earliest writings giving reference to occultism is the <b>Egyptian Book of the Dead</b>, a compilation of rituals explicitly describing methods of torture and intimidation (to create trauma), the use of potions (drugs) and the casting of spells (hypnotism), ultimately resulting in the total enslavement of the initiate. These have been the main ingredients for a part of occultism known as <b>Satanism</b>, throughout the ages.” In the Crowley Thoth deck (Thoth is the Egyptian God mostly associated with magic, writing, science, and judgment of the dead) the serpent either represents Satan himself, or it represents the so-called “<b>serpent class</b>”, who are adepts at the occult. Also in at least three different decks, is an upside-down <b>ankh</b>, which is the Egyptian symbol for life and fertility, a symbol that closely resembles the currently accepted sign of female. For some reason, I was always very attached to the symbol of the Ankh, while never knowing what symbolism meant. The 12<sup>th</sup> trump card is a <b>graven image</b> in the respect that it is an image of suffering and/or death. This curse has made it impossible for me to live a normal life, or have any true freewill, because I have been metaphorically upside-down or reversed throughout my entire life. The reversed nature of the card, and especially of the upside-down ankh in the 12<sup>th</sup> trump of at least three decks of the tarot, has caused that reversed vibration to manifest itself in my life, in the following ways:</p>
<p>1)      I was naturally left handed, but the person teaching me to write made me be right handed, by telling me that left-handedness is evil. I was a small child when this happened, but over time, it had the effect of helping to make me a very negative person.</p>
<p>2)      My mother named me with initials that spelled the word for a specific animal, <b>dehumanizing</b> me. Later, she would tell me, “I don’t know why I named you that, I don’t even like cats”.</p>
<p>3)      My mother constantly put me down, bullied me, called me names, and held other people’s children over her own, comparing me to my cousins, my friends, often telling me that I was no good and that I would “never amount to anything”.</p>
<p>4)      My mother (born on 4/4 which corresponds to the 4<sup>th</sup> trump, the Emperor card) had way too much power to be raising someone in such a prone position, as what is displayed on the 12th trump. This card, backed with some sort of occult intent to make a living sacrifice on a metaphysical level, created an energy of powerlessness. The voices coming through those implants tell me that I am to be a ritual blood sacrifice.</p>
<p>5)      The television (tell-a-vision) was my primary babysitter. I was left alone in my childhood, and was even allowed to play alone in the woods at 6 and 7 years old. Anything could’ve happened back then (including being implanted), since I have memories of going to the woods, memories of playing in the woods, but no memories of coming home. Doesn’t that seem strange to anyone besides me?</p>
<p>6)      My mother smoked 3 packs of cigarettes daily, exposing me, because they did not know the impact of second hand smoke on a baby back then, which addicted me to nicotine at a very early age, and caused me to have asthma.</p>
<p>7)      My brother often enjoyed terrorizing me. One such example I can cite is of him wrapping me up in a blanket and tossing me down the stairs. When I got to the bottom of those stairs, I pushed the blanket off of me, and saw my parents laughing at me.</p>
<p>Regarding other accusations about things I may or may not have done in my lifetime: Anything I am actually guilty of is <b>directly attributable</b> to the <b>occult curse</b> I have been living under throughout my life. However, I have done comparably little evil in this world, when compared to what has been done to me. Considering the fact that I have implants in my head, that are easily provable, there is no telling how long I have been subliminally affected by them, or what the voices coming through them have said to me in my sleep. Yet, I’ve never gone out and killed anyone, and I never will.</p>
<p><b>That being said, the following is a list of accusations and responses to them:</b></p>
<p>1)      I have been accused of not sharing, but if one considers how my whole life was orchestrated and my inspiration was stolen from me via the serpent class, as represented by the snake at the head of the victim in the 12<sup>th</sup> trump of the <b>Thoth</b>, <b>Ludovica</b>, and<b> Hermetic</b> tarot decks, then it would stand to reason that I would have a subconscious need to hold onto things, as a security issue, given that I was subconsciously seeing my own creative ideas being stolen. For example, artistic ideas were stolen from me (C.A.T.) by people like M.J. Skinner (“skin the cat”). That being said, let it be known that when I saw others who were truly in need, even when I was myself living in substandard conditions, I still shared what I had. Please see my document entitled, “<b>Metaphysical Sabotage</b>”.</p>
<p>2)      I have been accused of being a pedophile ….   This is simply ridiculous and doesn’t even deserve a response, but the answer is: NO, I AM NOT A PEDOPHILE, NOR HAVE I EVER KISSED OR DONE ANYTHING REMOTELY SEXUAL WITH ANYONE UNDER AGE,. HOWEVER, I MYSELF WAS DATE-RAPED, WHEN I WAS 16 Y/O, BY A 21 Y/O, AND IT WAS MY VERY FIRST EXPERIENCE OF INTERCOURSE. I NEVER PROSECUTED HIM.</p>
<p>3)      I have been accused of being a racist ….  Never in my life have I ever been racist, nor have I ever discriminated on the basis of anything. In fact, even as a child, I always showed the utmost respect for oppressed races and cultures.</p>
<p>4)      I have been accused of being a baby killer. While I deeply regret having two abortions, I had no parents around raising me, and as a result, I ended up following much of what those around me believed, especially the males, because I sorely lacked a father figure in my life. At one point, I ended up with a boyfriend who as prochoice and exposed me to the book called “Our Bodies Ourselves”, which approved of abortion. Unbeknownst to me, my subconscious was having a strong influence in my life, and had me always seeking out a daddy. In my late teens and early twenties (and even into my 30s), I was easily influenced by every boyfriend I had.</p>
<p>5)      I have been accused of being lazy. Up until I found myself in excruciating pain, I have always taken relatively good care of my home, until I found myself simultaneously working, taking care of a toddler, and trying to keep house from 2005 until 2008.</p>
<p>6)      I have been accused of being a whore, which I am most certainly not. There have been short moments in my life, when I was forced to live like one, like when I was living in the streets, but I am not one, and have not truly ever been one.</p>
<p>7)      I was a latchkey kid from 9y/o until I moved out, even though my mother didn’t have to work during that time, at all.</p>
<p>8)      As previously discussed, I have been living under an occult curse my entire life, as a result of my birthdate in relation to the 12<sup>th</sup> trump of the Thoth tarot, with the upside-down ankh (the Egyptian symbol for life &amp; fertility), with my mother being the 4<sup>th</sup> trump, allowing her way too much power over me.</p>
<p>9)      I have been accused of being a narcissist … I spent half my childhood in a house of mirrors, with a narcissist mother, in which there was a completely mirrored coffee table, the closet doors were mirrored, the bedroom sets were mirrored, and even the wallpaper was mirrored. Can you say PSYOPS? What does growing up in a house of mirrors do to a child anyway? So I probably WAS one, but I am not one now. For info on the role mirrors play in mind control, please see the following: <a href="http://www.theforbiddenknowledge.com/hardtruth/mind_control_art.htm">http://www.theforbiddenknowledge.com/hardtruth/mind_control_art.htm</a></p>
<p>For more info on general mind control programming, including the use of mirrors, see the Fritz Springmeier and Cisco Wheeler document about &#8220;Undetectable Mind Controlled Slaves&#8221;, here: <a href="http://www.emhdf.com/Monarch-mind-control.pdf">http://www.emhdf.com/Monarch-mind-control.pdf</a></p>
<p>10)   I have been accused of being “cruel” …  well, I couldn’t have possibly been as cruel to my child as the catholic church has been to me, by holding me in custody for the first 6 weeks of my life (with no parental bonding), or by allowing some agency to put implants in my head. There was a time, when I was in my late teens or early twenties when this guy named Bob punched me and threw me into a sliding glass door. I retaliated after being goaded by his own friends. I am not proud of what I did. I painted his member red. Even to this day, when I have repented of it to people I know, I was told it was “funny” not “horrible”, and that he deserved it for hitting a woman. However, I sincerely regret it.</p>
<p>11)   If the accusation is in relation to me name calling or being a bully when I was younger… well, my parents were bullies to me (mom called me stupid, while dad called me fat). Growing up, my friends made up names for others, and so did I. “When in Rome, etc.” I think this is where that came from, but I changed. For example, there was a teacher in my school named Emma Mosteller, and my friend, Lucianne, made up the name, “Enima Molester”. I subsequently called my friend “Lusty Anus”. I am not proud of it, but I was following a pattern. Considering the fact that I was metaphorically upside-down, it should come as no surprise.</p>
<p>12)   I have been told that “you snooze you lose”, regarding the fact that, after I lost my job, finding myself in horrible, nightmarish pain, with no vehicle, no place to go, and living in a foreclosed house with no power or water, it took me over three years to begin writing about my experiences in any coherent way. I had virtually no access to a computer, so I was unable to learn much of anything in relation to the curse, or anything else for that matter. When I was able to get to a library, I found many books unavailable. I contend that I was not snoozing, rather, I was cut off from every outlet to state my case for forgiveness, once I began to learn of the metaphysical curse I had been living under throughout my life. Also, I was in a state of constant traumatic pain and hearing voices through these implants, which I sometimes want to call “headphones”. Even friends and neighbors would rarely let me use their computers to get online, so I was unable to post my experiences. When I was able to get online, I was hit with either (at neighbor&#8217;s house) someone talking in my face during the whole time, which distracted me, or (at library) I would be inundated with various voices throwing me off track, or scaring me into leaving with threats. Wherever I went for help regarding my specific problem, I was not able to get adequate treatment, which I sincerely hope will change soon. Whoever is responsible for the ongoing Traumatic Stress Disorder should have to face some consequences for their actions, because its goal seems to be just to make me appear insane, or to actually drive me insane, but it seems like there is some agency that does not truly want me to get help, or recover.</p>
<p>13)   I have been accused of being a liar … Honestly, when I was younger, I did make things up to try to get attention from my parents, because they were simply absent during my childhood, but I did change. In fact, I made the conscious effort to change because I did not like getting attention that way, and I didn&#8217;t want to be a liar. At the risk of being labeled a liar by my accusers/gang-stalkers, I am being honest about my past. At one point, after discovering what was happening to me, I believed that one of my doctors (OB/GYN) might have been named Delgado, but I have since researched my personal files, and realized that neither one of them had that name. <i>This tells me that these verifiable implants have been used to enforce the idea that I had a doctor named Delgado, just so someone could then paint me as a liar</i>. While it is possible I had an oral surgeon by that name, I cannot verify the name of the last oral surgeon I had, who was in St. Petersburg, FL. The first oral surgeon I had was named Castellano, and was in Tampa. Regardless of what doctor put the implants in, and what doctor did the horrifying procedure to my privates, the flashback and the pain are absolutely real. <b>I have no doubt that trauma occurred in my privates to cause it, but of course, no one wants to believe it, or give me a true exam, or even give me pain medication for it. </b>The trauma to my privates has caused the condition noted above called vulvodynia, which is a constant pain in the area, usually caused by a<b> previous trauma to the area</b>.</p>
<p>14)   I have been called a “user” … I honestly do not want to be disabled, not in the least. I have always worked very hard for my money, and in most job I’ve held, I was always the top performer. However, I am suffering from severe PTSD due to the horrible and evil events that happened to me. The obvious implants, that are located in front of each ear, may have subliminally influenced me the whole time they have been in place. For all I know, they may have been sending me subliminal messages during my sleep to make me psychologically unwell.</p>
<p>What was done to me, throughout my life, violated every law imaginable at the time of my adoption. From what I understand, back in the 60s, it was illegal to put implants in a child&#8217;s ears, and mind control was illegal. These days, it seems to be the norm, as I can see and hear it in the music, movies, and television. Since the patriot virtually repealed every human right we had in our constitution, those who wish to subvert human rights seem to have been given carte blanche to do so.</p>
<p>If there is an honorable attorney out there, who recognizes that at the very least, that I should be grandfathered in to being able to sue those responsible for my implants, due to the date of implantation, I would love to hear from one. I have read that one can find the manufacturer of an implant by examining it under a microscope.</p>
<p>I believe I was sold into slavery, to be a part of some horrible macabre experiment, designed to influence me in a subliminal and insidious way, to do things against my true nature and freewill. I hope those who are inflicting this &#8220;soft-kill/no-touch torture&#8221;, as well as that those who put the implants in my ears are someday held liable for their actions, for what they are doing and have done to me is the most heinous crime I could&#8217;ve ever thought possible.</p>
<p>I pray every day that someone can help me. I am living in what I can only describe as a mental concentration camp.</p>

<p>My mind control case is not as sensational as those of Cathy OBrien or Brice Taylor, because my situation is much more covert, is is therefore more sinister, since I cannot point to the actual perpetrators of the crime against me, that started when I was born.</p>
<p>Much of my mind control programming has been done via implants at each ear, the size of <strong>RFID</strong>s, Which are suspiciously located exactly where the external part of a cochlear implant would be (although mine go through the cartilage and are under the skin), possibly linking directly into my <a href="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/rightsideimplant.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="250" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2012/09/11/symbolism-mind-control-and-metaphysical-sabotage-in-relation-to-archetypal-transference-and-the-second-commandment-of-the-decalogue/rightsideimplant-4/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/rightsideimplant.jpg" data-orig-size="154,205" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;2.8&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;KODAK EASYSHARE M863 DIGITAL CAMERA&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;1196959494&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;5.7&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;160&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.063055&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="RightSideImplant" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/rightsideimplant.jpg?w=154" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/rightsideimplant.jpg?w=154" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-250" style="width:135px;height:189px;" title="RightSideImplant" alt="Implant with circle to indicate location" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/rightsideimplant.jpg?w=112&#038;h=150" width="112" height="150" srcset="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/rightsideimplant.jpg?w=112&amp;h=150 112w, https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/rightsideimplant.jpg 154w" sizes="(max-width: 112px) 100vw, 112px" /></a>brain, which allows the <strong>perpetraitors</strong> (misspelled on purpose to denote that these people are indeed<em> traitors</em> to their own country because they are violating innocent human beings from birth and well into adulthood, possibly for one’s entire life), to do their evil, unseen by me, so I cannot point to specific persons to accuse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I cannot blame the adoption agency, Catholic Charities, directly, because I can no longer find the article where I saw that they were indicted for child trafficking, although I did see it in a news story on television. Since I cannot back up the claim with any proof, I cannot make the claim.</p>
<p>I recently received a link from a kind reader, showing me how the Catholic church in Spain was involved in trafficking over 300,000 babies, telling their mothers their babies had died at birth:</p>
<p>&#8220;300,000 babies stolen from their parents &#8211; and sold for adoption: Haunting BBC documentary exposes 50-year scandal of baby trafficking by the Catholic church in Spain&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2049647/BBC-documentary-exposes-50-year-scandal-baby-trafficking-Catholic-church-Spain.html">http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2049647/BBC-documentary-exposes-50-year-scandal-baby-trafficking-Catholic-church-Spain.html</a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a sick thing going on in the catholic church. If they&#8217;ve been doing it over in Spain, is it any stretch to think they might have done it to me and sold me into a mind control program, putting implants in my head as a baby during the first 6 weeks of my life, when I was in the agency&#8217;s custody?</p>
<p>That being said, most people who have done any research on children who are used in experiments are frequently from orphanages. It also must be noted that many targeted individuals that I know are adopted or were in foster homes.</p>

<p>Satanic Ritual Abuse is a well-known phenomenon, yet most people I speak to about it won’t recognize that it might have happened to me, in combination with mind control.</p>
<p>I am constantly being threatened by these voices to be thrown in jail, framed for something I haven’t done. My answer to those who are using these implants not only for telemetry, but also for broadcasting, is that if I ever end up in front of detectives or a judge, I will tell these people that I have these implants, and that those who did it, or those who are subordinates of those who did it, are interested in me being put away so I cannot talk about what has been done to me during my lifetime. <strong>Mind Control, Satanic Ritual Abuse, and the Occult go hand in hand.</strong> Knowing that the Constitution seems to no longer safeguard the public from these situations, I urge the reader to examine the following in relation to my implants (given that when they were implanted, in my infancy or early childhood, the Constitution was supposed to have protected me from such a violation):</p>

The<strong> implants</strong> make it more insidious because I cannot point directly to some evil mind like Dr. Cameron or Dr. Mengele and sue them, since they were probably implanted in my head when I was a baby, so I would not retain a memory of the procedure, nor remember the pain from it. Since I was in the agency&#8217;s custody for the first six weeks of my life, this seems to be the most likely time when it would&#8217;ve happened. My programming was more subtle, and less proveable than mind control victims like Cathy O&#8217;Brien or Brice Taylor, except for the implants, which I have so far been unable to get looked at by a professional.</p>
<p>The fact that I was denied disability, despite the fact that I have a history of mental issues, such as a suicide attempt at 17y/o, a record of drug abuse (which is <strong><em>common for people suffering from mental issues related to mind control, ritual abuse and/or</em> <em>neglect</em></strong>), records of visits to various psychiatrists and psychologists throughout my lifetime, including three baker acts, tells me that the <strong>judge</strong> who did my hearing is indeed <strong>crooked, or at least terribly misinformed</strong>. I have been made disabled on purpose, with neglect, mental abuse, mind control, and satanic ritual abuse. Now I am targeted as if I am being punished for the way I have been set up in the first place.</p>
<p>Despite my emotional problems related to abuse, up until 4 years ago, I always worked my butt off for every dime I ever earned.  That all changed when I began to remember some of the things that happened to me. I became the target for what is now being called “no-touch torture” or electronic harassment. It is well-known in psychological studies that traumatic memories of ritual abuse and mind control often come out in one’s forties. I began to hear voices in my forties, accompanied by memories of abuse, and that is when my life fell apart. Whether diagnosed for PTSD, or for schizophrenia (which seems to be one of the aims of mind control practices- to discredit the victim), either way, they are diagnoses worthy of disability, to say the least, and possibly a criminal investigation to exactly what happened to me. This last note is with the idea in mind that I have implants for crying out loud! Of course, I was denied disability by a judge, who ought to lose her job.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when I research mind control and ritual abuse, I find that most doctors and law enforcement are a part of this network of destroying lives.</p>
<p>When I began to have memories of certain incidents come back to me, such as an instance of my mother leaving me alone crying in the crib for hours, telling me to “eat shit and die”, or her blowing cigarette smoke in my face (she smoked 3 packs a day), or my uncle blaming me for my Aunt’s heart attack, or being wrapped in a blanket and tossed down the stairs by my brother, to come out of the blanket and find both my parents laughing and pointing their fingers at me, that is when my character was assassinated, I lost my job writing articles, and my whole life commenced falling apart. It seems like I was intentionally discredited, so that I would not be able to get any real help for my situation.</p>
<p>Among people I have spoken with regarding the implants, there seems to be some disagreements as to what these things in my head (through which I hear voices and feel buzzing sensations) are. I have had one person say they are “cutaneous horns”, which I have looked up, and what I have are subcutaneous, so that couldn’t be it. When I did a search for &#8220;subcutaneous horns&#8221;, I found only photos of &#8220;cutaneous horns&#8221;. I had a <em>psychologist</em> try to tell me they are keloids, which they obviously are not, since keloids are on the skin, not under it, and since <em>what I have</em> <em>looks nothing like keloids</em>. By the way, from what I understand, people with keloids do not hear things through them, nor do they feel vibrations through them, and people with cutaneous horns have not mentioned that they hear or feel anything through them either. One other thing of note, regarding my implants, is the fact that if I put my finger in the top part of my ear, on the other side of where the implant is, I can feel a nub there. So the things in my ears are oval shaped, and both ends of them can be felt. This means they go through the cartilage of my ears.</p>
<p>To these people who do not believe me, why doesn’t one of them, or all of them combined, help me get one of these implants taken out of my head, to <a href="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/rfid_rice_fingers.png"><img data-attachment-id="561" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2012/12/16/i-am-a-human-being/rfid_rice_fingers/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/rfid_rice_fingers.png" data-orig-size="225,225" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="RFID_rice_fingers" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/rfid_rice_fingers.png?w=225" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/rfid_rice_fingers.png?w=225" class="alignright size-full wp-image-561" alt="RFIDRiceFingersComparison" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/rfid_rice_fingers.png?w=540" srcset="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/rfid_rice_fingers.png 225w, https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/rfid_rice_fingers.png?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px"   /></a>determine what they really are? Then we could see the truth of the matter. I mean, they ARE the size of <strong>RFID</strong> tags. Perhaps I haven&#8217;t been able to get any help because they do not want the truth to get out. I am forced to assume this, given the circumstances of my character assassination, the loss of my job, the fact that all of my friends and neighbors have been convinced to ignore me.</p>
<p>One example of how my situation clearly looks like a mind control case is that the <strong>mirrors</strong> used in my <strong>programming</strong> were everywhere within the home I lived in for the 2<sup>nd</sup> half of my childhood. There was a mirrored coffee table, mirrored wallpaper, a mirrored pedestal for chrome art, mirrored dressers, mirrored closet doors, mirrored end tables, mirrored switch plates, mirrored cotton ball dispensers, and mirrored art on the walls. Using mirrors is a well-known method of mind control cited in the Springmeier/Wheeler book. Another example is that I had the classic near-drowning at the age of 3, which is common to ritual abuse survivors.</p>
<p>The RFID tags would have been enough, and they have probably been using them my whole life to mess with my head, possibly while I slept. Yet, no one wants to believe it’s possible that this could be happening to me, even though when I was born, in the late 60s, programs of mind control were more than established. <strong>Dr. Jose Delgado</strong> was able to stop an implanted, charging bull with a remote control in 1963. <a href="http://www.wireheading.com/delgado/brainchips.pdf">http://www.wireheading.com/delgado/brainchips.pdf</a></p>
<p>I had a surgery for cervical dysplasia in 2004, under a general anesthetic. I have had a flashback of something horrible and unthinkable that happened to me during that procedure. It is a flashback because I can see the masked doctor and my mother, I can hear the whirring instrument, I can hear my mother’s voice, and I can hear my own screams while I am being mutilated. I have had a psychologist say to me, “I know you like to tell stories”. To her, I can only hope that one day, she goes through something like this and no one believes her. As a result of this procedure, I now have a condition called vulvodynia, which usually results from <strong>trauma</strong> to the area. Of course, I have been so far, unable to get it treated. This procedure is most likely why I became afraid of lawn mowers in 2008.</p>
<p>It is my sincere hope that I will be able to find an honorable doctor and/or attorney to help me with my situation. I may not be able to point the finger at any one person and sue them (unles it is the adoption agency that sold me into this horrible experiment), but perhaps I could at least get some decent treatment for my issues, so I can go back to work and lead a normal life.</p>
<p>Some people who read this may assume that I am just trying to get attention. This is false. I am trying to raise a kid while these implants are delivering very malicious messages into my mind. It is a very difficult situation I find myself in. I never dreamed that I was a mind control victim, and I certainly do not wish to be. The only attention I am trying to get is that of an honrable doctor or attorney to help me get one removed so I can get a serial number from it and track down the manufacturer.</p>
<p>It is my fear that I was sold into slavery via this Catholic adoption, just to be implanted at birth, so I could be the subject of this horrible, evil mind control, via these implants, so that I could be made a ritual sacrifice for these evil creatures that should get eaten by their own kind for what they&#8217;ve done.</p>

<p><strong>No Graven Images:</strong></p>
<p>Has anyone noticed that, as newer versions of the bible come out, the term, “<em>Graven Images</em>&#8221; has been selectively removed? I believe there is a reason for this. This is a short document about the results of a certain graven image from the tarot, the 12th trump, in 2012. Graven Images are literally “images fraught with danger or harm&#8221;. I think the statement in the 2nd commandment of the Decalogue had more than one purpose. It seems that graven images are able to cause all sorts of chaos in the world, through a process that could be referred to as <strong>Archetypal Transference</strong>. The Lil Wayne video, foreshadowing the Batman movie premier shooting by James Holmes, is an example of how so-called &#8220;<strong>Graven Images</strong>&#8221; can have a negative impact on our society. I feel that the second commandment of the Decalogue was either mistranslated, or misinterpreted (selectively interpreted), leaving a part of the meaning out, based on the meaning of <i>the word &#8220;graven&#8221; as a past participle of the word &#8220;grave&#8221;.</i> I have seen where certain &#8220;graven images&#8221; have had effects on others. In the case of the shooting in Aurora, Colorado recently, at a Batman movie premier: the shooter, James Holmes, killed 12 people and injured 71. This event was foreshadowed by a &#8220;Lil Wayne&#8221; video called, &#8220;<strong>My Homies Still</strong>&#8220;, in which he shows 12 skeletons in a movie theatre, amongst live people, while he sings in front of them. Could it be that the &#8220;graven image&#8221;/image of death caused a vibration to be carried out by some unwitting patsy? Could images of death have impacts on people that are not seen to date, via <strong>chaos magic</strong> and/or <strong>quantum mechanics</strong>? This image of the screen shot above was taken from: <a href="http://illuminatiwatcher.com/?p=2924" rel="nofollow">http://illuminatiwatcher.com/?p=2924</a>.</p>
<p>The images on either side of the screen shot, are two versions of the 12th trump of the Tarot, one is from the Crowley-Harris Thoth deck, while the other is a painting by Ludovica Wing Shuen Price. (Link: <a href="http://www.elfwood.com/art/l/u/ludovica/the_hanged_man.jpg.html">http://www.elfwood.com/art/l/u/ludovica/the_hanged_man.jpg.html</a>). Both images seem to illustrate some of what is happening in our world in the years surrounding 2012.</p>
<p>This document is about how symbolism has been used to negatively affect our society, taking away a person’s freewill, without them knowing it. I am no “Bible-thumper”, but I contend that the second commandment is more than a comment on idolatry, and may have been mistranslated to keep people from understanding its original intent. Most people see the word “graven” in the Bible, and say it means “engraven”, as in an engraved image. As noted above, the word “<em>graven</em>” is a <em>past participle </em>of the word, “<em>grave</em>”, and is both noun and adjective. As a noun, a “grave” is a tomb or sepulcher. As an adjective, the word “graven” means (from <a href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/graven">http://www.thefreedictionary.com/graven</a>): &#8220;fraught with danger or harm”, and “somber or dark in hue”. With this in mind, <strong>an image of death and/or destruction is a graven image</strong>. After much study of the subject of symbolism, I have seen how <strong>life imitates art </strong>in the most unfortunate ways, due to the large-scale, metaphysical impact of the graven images in the Tarot. I have also seen how it <em>has affected all of us living in the years surrounding 2012</em>. One way I know that I am very close to the truth is that, since I began to understand these things, I became a target for the worst kind of <em>harassment</em> and <em>smear campaign</em> I would have ever thought possible, had I ever conceived of such a thing, before it happened to me. I ask the reader to keep in mind the <strong>effects of Tarot symbolism on the human psyche</strong>, as they read this. If you have a<strong> double digit birthdate</strong>, please pay special attention to what is written here. There is a reason why I am being kept from speaking out, why people who say they espouse the truth will not respond to emails, and why I have had my character assassinated.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Archetypal Transference, Chaos Theory, and the Law of Attraction:</strong></p>
<p>I have seen many spiritualists and new-agers speaking of how the manifestation of a certain desire can be achieved by the amplification of a vibration, which occurs when the image or thought of that vibration is repeatedly focused on, causing what is called a <em>feedback loop</em>. This concept of is often discussed in <strong>quantum and chaos theories</strong>. It is usually spoken of as a way to manifest good things for oneself.</p>
<p>However, <strong>I have seen where the repetition of a specific vibration can manifest deleterious effects on people</strong> unaware of the precarious position they were placed in, at birth, through the use of various archetypes.</p>
<p>Please consider the phrase &#8220;<em>justice is blind</em>&#8221; &amp; the corresponding <em>archetype</em> of the blindfolded lady justice for a quick example of the way this can work to someone&#8217;s detriment, without their knowledge. <a href="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/09/20/why-is-justice-blind/">https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/09/20/why-is-justice-blind/</a></p>
<p>Due to my birthday being 12/12, the graven image that seems to have had a very negative impact on my life is the 12<sup>th</sup> trump card of the tarot (see images above), showing either a crucified or upside-down figure. The deck that I am most connected to seems to be the Thoth deck, also referred to as “the Crowley deck”, and was originally printed in 1941. In this deck, the figure in the 12<sup>th</sup> trump, known as “The Dying God” (image at top, left), is not only upside-down, but is also unconscious, having nails on three limbs.<em> The deck is definitely stacked against this character</em>. One foot is tied to an upside-down ankh, which is the Egyptian symbol for life and fertility, that happens to closely resemble the symbol for female, indicating a female life lived in reverse (coincidentally, “live” spelled backwards is “evil”). The position of the serpent at the head of the figure has severely negative connotations, whether it represents the serpent class or Satan himself. To me, this is certainly a “graven image”, that is, it is an image of suffering and/or death. <em>The meaning, usually associated with getting this card in a reading, obscures the truth about what the vibration of that card may do to people born on the 12/12 date</em>. It is related to something called “<strong>Archetypal Semiotic Transference</strong>”, as written about in Michael Gaio’s article, which can be found online at: <a href="http://blog.michaelgaio.com/2011/09/25/archetypal-semiotic-transference/"><strong>http://blog.michaelgaio.com/2011/09/25/archetypal-semiotic-transference/</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>What it really represents is a form of metaphysical sabotage, creating a form of slavery whereby the victim has his or her intellectual property stolen from them on a subconscious level. </strong>The victim never is able to understand why they feel so spiritually depleted, because they are not made aware of it on a conscious level. It becomes a disturbance in the mind, setting the tone for a reversed or inverted sort of life.</p>
<p><strong>The Tarot and Freewill (or Lack Thereof):</strong></p>
<p>As you can see, certain &#8220;graven images&#8221; have had a weighty impact on my life, simply due to my birthdate being 12/12. Some will say that I am playing a victim. I can assure you it is not by choice. I am not the only person being affected by these images. I know of one other person born on 12/12, and one born on 12/24, experiencing this effect to some degree. I ask you to read this document with the intent to know truth. This document is my proof that I have not been allowed to have real freewill in my life, due to an <em>occult curse</em> that was put on me since I was born. Although I never knew about the Tarot until more recently, it still had powerful effects on me, even in my childhood.</p>
<p>There seems to be some debate about how long the tarot has been in existence in its current form. Most Tarot aficionados say its current manifestation began in the 18<sup>th</sup> century, while some believe it was the 16<sup>th</sup> century. In either case, the tarot has been around for more than a couple of centuries, with the 12<sup>th</sup> trump as The Hanged Man. Attesting to the popularity of the tarot, is the fact that there are over a thousand tarot decks in print today, with untold printings of each deck. While there may be some variations, almost every deck I have seen has the same archetypes in the trump cards, although there are some exceptions. The most notable exception is the Crowley-Harris Thoth deck (with Egyptian, Astrological, and Cabbalistic influences), whereby the 11<sup>th</sup> trump, which is traditionally the “Justice” card, has been replaced by a card known as “Lust”, and the 8<sup>th</sup> trump, which is traditionally the “Strength” card, has been replaced by the card known as “Adjustment”. I relate this form of mind control, using the symbolism of the tarot, to the Monarch Program, and other programs of mind control, because those who have power over those who do not, have gotten and continue to get their power through morally reprehensible ways, using occult practices (including the <em>Egyptian Book of the Dead</em>), manipulating symbols that are supposed to be sacred, and causing untold suffering to their victims.</p>

<p>Here are two pictures of an <strong>Ankh</strong>. While there are multiple meanings attached to this symbol, it is the mostly used to represent the word “<strong>life</strong>” in Egyptian hieroglyphs, and it happens to closely resemble the commonly accepted symbol for female. What does it imply when this symbol is upside-down? Has anyone noticed how, in 2012, life seems to be upside-down? In a so-called free country, laws protecting our freedoms have been severely restricted. The Catholic Church, which is supposed to be a spiritual organization, has been indicted on child-trafficking charges? The Catholic Church, at the Vatican, has eight obelisks, imported from Egypt at Vatican Square, and five ancient Roman obelisks, so they are indeed using symbols of an Egyptian heritage. How spiritual is it to sell children into slavery to be victims of mind control? Is it also possible that the images of the tarot have had some impact on the state of our world, depending on the year? I am reminded of the oft-quoted statement by Michael Ellner: &#8220;<em>Just look at us. Everything is backwards; everything is upside down. Doctors destroy health, lawyers destroy justice, universities destroy knowledge, governments destroy freedom, the major media destroy information and religions destroy spirituality</em>.” Is it any surprise that this upside-down state of the world has reached a pinnacle in the year 2012, considering the image of the upside-down person on the 12<sup>th</sup> trump of virtually every tarot deck, and considering the <strong>symbol for life is upside-down</strong> <strong>in at least two decks</strong>, which have rapidly gained in popularity, over the past few years? If everything is upside-down in and around 2012, what happens in 2013? The 13<sup>th</sup> trump of every deck is the Death card, which is yet another graven image from theTarot. This indicates that those born on 12/12, 12/21, or also 12/24, since the 24 is 12+12, have been metaphorically and metaphysically, close to death.</p>
<p><strong>Law of Attraction and Memes:</strong></p>
<p>If both chaos theory and quantum theory, as applied to metaphysics, illustrate how what you focus on becomes attracted to you, as is discussed in movies like <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">The Secret</span></em> and <em><span style="text-decoration:underline;">What the Bleep Do We Know?</span></em>, then is it possible to program someone into attracting negative things by using symbolism in negative ways? How can one overcome such an amplified vibrational effect? Is it also possible that, with so many people studying the tarot, do readings for other people, developing their own decks, and so many people repeating the same patterns of symbolism in their versions of the tarot, that those archetypal energies become amplified? I submit that the <strong>Tarot are</strong> <strong>decks of glorified flash cards, tools used for the apparatus of Mind Control, causing</strong> certain <strong>negative memes</strong> (a term coined by Richard Dawkins)<strong> to run rampant </strong>in our world. From Wikipedia: “A meme is an idea, behavior or style that spreads from person to person within a culture. A meme acts as a unit for carrying cultural ideas, <em>symbols</em> or practices, which <em>can be transmitted from one mind to another through writing, speech, gestures, rituals or other imitable phenomena</em>. Supporters of the concept regard memes as cultural analogues to genes in that they self- replicate, mutate and respond to selective pressures.” The rising popularity of the tarot has allowed certain memes to pervade in our culture, possibly contributing to the negative situation in our world today, where so many of us now lack those freedoms we once took for granted.

Did someone have a specific intent in creating that logo? Is someone <em>tearing life apart</em> in that logo? Fertility? Women? I have to wonder how many of these shoes are currently in circulation, and how many people have repeatedly focused on that image, thereby generating a very negative meme. As a meme, that image would cause serious problems in life, given the meaning of such a symbol.</p>

<p><strong>Archetypal Transference:</strong></p>
<p>Many people in our society believe that astrology has an impact on people’s lives and personalities. This effect has been seen often when comparing a person with their astrological sign. For example, Scorpios are known to be kind of cruel, while Leos are known to always take center stage in any situation. This effect has been studied at length, but the effect of the Tarot on people is much more subversive and subliminal, and lesser studied. Most people use the Tarot as a guide for telling a person’s future, although C. G. Jung was one person interested in studying the archetypes of the Tarot in relation to one’s psychology, which is where “<em>Archetypal Transference</em>” comes in. Many people believe in what Jung called the “collective unconscious”. Could this be how Archetypal Transference is achieved? With so many people using the Tarot these days, is it possible that these images become more amplified in the collective unconscious? I suggest that this is why I and others born on 12/12 have felt so cursed and mistreated throughout their lives, especially as we have approached the year 2012.</p>

<p>Lest the reader doubt my understanding of symbolism, please note how the word <em>television</em> is symbolic of  “<em>telling a vision</em>” and how the word <strong>music</strong> (mu and sic being two separate words in the English language) is a combination of the words <strong>MU</strong>: “<strong>12<sup>th</sup> letter of the Greek alphabet</strong>”, and <strong>SIC</strong>: “<strong>as intentionally so written</strong>”. This can be viewed as the vibration of the number twelve being “as intentionally so written”. This is <strong>symbolism</strong> in its most basic form, as <em>found in our everyday language</em>, which has its effects on the most fundamental level, influencing the way we view everything in our lives, including other people. In my life, it seems to have manifested in the profound way music affected me, but then also, it often seems like my own subconscious has also affected much of the popular music in some ways. I say this because so much of the music I am hearing lately reflects things in my own programming. Some other examples of negative symbolism in the language includes words such as Bill, Chill, Mill, which contain the root word “ill”, in them, and Bow, Chow, Sow, which contain the root word “ow”. There are many other examples of this.</p>
<p><strong>Self-Fulfilling Prophecies:</strong></p>
<p>I have been living under this archetypal curse my whole life, without ever knowing about the Tarot, and archetypically, my whole life has seemed upside-down. It seems to have caused me to be spiritually sick. <strong>I am not the only person born on 12/12 (“a meta-twelve”) who </strong><strong>feels like they have been living under a curse. </strong>It would be interesting to do a study on those born on double digit birthdates, to see if their lives have related to the corresponding trump card of the Tarot, depending on the deck. For those born on a date such as 1/1, (“meta-one”), the 1<sup>st</sup>trump of just about every Tarot deck is the Magi card, which would be advantageous to anyone born on that date. In my case, my having a “meta vibration” has been a curse, having a severe impact on my life, but is connected to more than just my birthday, which had the effect of tying me to the Hanged Man card; my name, which dehumanized me, due to my initials spelling the name of an animal (C.A.T.); and my adoptive mother, who, despite the fact that she never invested any time or love in me to speak of, always berated me and compared me to others in a negative way. These things had what is called a “<strong>butterfly effect</strong>” (a concept from chaos theory) in my life, hence the image to the right, from</p>

<p><a href="http://www.tigerpixie.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.tigerpixie.com</a>. There was definitely a purpose behind this curse. I cannot help but wonder if this Tarot curse is a way of <em>artificially handicapping</em> a select group of people, somewhat like what is described in the Kurt Vonnegut short story entitled, “<em>Harrison Bergeron”,</em> but in a metaphysical, rather than physical, way? Could I have been involved in the so-called “<strong>Monarch Program</strong>”? It is a hard truth to avoid, given that I have implants in front of each ear (photos below), and my whole life seems to have been orchestrated. I have found one other person born on my birthdate, who has also said he felt like his whole life was cursed. What must be noted is the effect of “self-fulfilling prophecies” on a person’s life. For example, when I was in the first grade, I scored in the top 2% of my class for IQ, but my mother gave me so much negative reinforcement when I was growing up, that I was lucky to graduate with a C average and a very low self-esteem, thus resulting in a <em>self-fulfilling prophecy</em>. Is it a coincidence that my mother’s maiden name was such that it became “Nay Gaeta” once she got married, and had a “negator” effect on my life? I mean, how many times can you call your child stupid before it begins to take a toll on your child’s IQ, which has already been artificially handicapped by what is illustrated in the below paragraph.</p>
<p><strong>Reversed Polarity:</strong></p>
<p>The following is an example of one way that this curse manifested itself in my life: When I learned how to write, I was made to be right-handed, against my, God-given, natural, inclination to be left-handed. I was a good kid, so when the girl teaching me how to write told that being left-handed was evil, I endeavored to be right-handed, in an effort to make sure I would not end up being evil. Studies in stroke victims have shown that a stroke in the left hemisphere of the brain affects something on the right side of the body, which in turn, shows how one hemisphere of the brain generally controls the opposite side of the body. <strong>Having me write against my God-given, natural tendency reversed my polarity</strong>, so to speak. This is evident in the fact that I was originally a very positive and loving child, but ended up as a negative punk by my teenage years. I have known several people who were allowed to keep their natural left-handedness, and I found them to have more tenacity, will power, and perseverance, which are gifts that I have found lacking in myself and others that I have met who were naturally left-handed, but were made to learn to write with the right hand. In fact, the people I know who, like me, were originally left handed forced to be right handed, have all the creative tendencies of most lefties, but have blocks that keep them from being able to express their creativity. My being a “lefty turned righty” is a manifestation of the reverse effect of the 12<sup>th</sup> trump, and it had a negative impact on my life.</p>
<p>I believe this forced change, against ones natural tendency to be left-handed, could have far-reaching implications, which have not truly been studied, to my knowledge. I believe it could possibly alter one’s destiny, and cause someone, who is originally a naturally positive person, to become a very negative one. Since it would obviously take some time for this effect to work on the mind of the child, they would never know why they became so negative, and would wind up blaming themselves for their feelings, thoughts, and behavior, but had they been allowed to retain their natural left-handedness, their life might have ended up quite differently.  Taken in combination with what I mentioned earlier, regarding a negative upbringing, it could have disastrous consequences on the development of an individual. This concept doesn’t even take the archetypal memes from the Tarot into account. I see this as a result of my own experiences and observations. Could it really be that difficult a concept to grasp? Did I not take the same psychology classes in school as my peers did? Did I not see the same studies about strokes and the brain that others have?</p>
<p>Perhaps my theory about left-handed people made to be right seems far-fetched. However, I think that the fact that <strong>a stroke in the left hemisphere of the brain affects something on the right side of the body</strong> is enough to warrant some sort of serious investigation into the subject. Even if only taken on a subliminal and metaphoric level, one has to consider that making someone be right-handed against one’s natural left-handed inclination would be, symbolically and literally, taking someone out of their “right mind”.</p>
<p><strong>Archetypes and the Meta Effect:</strong></p>
<p>I had lived most of my life, lacking any knowledge of archetypes, symbolism, astrology, the Tarot, metaphysics, etc., yet these things still had a huge impact, effecting various events in my life, including, but not limited to: the way my own adoptive mother treated me, the way doctors treated me, the way friends and relatives treated me, and the way employers treated me, despite the fact that I was usually the best producer at my jobs. I always assumed that my negativity was the result of a lack of parenting, or me missing my father’s presence in my life. While those circumstances certainly contributed to my emotional problems, I can see how the archetypes installed in the Tarot had their metaphysical effect, not only on me, but also on my adoptive mother, due to her birthdate being 4/4. I believe it is the double digit birthdates that are the most influenced by the Tarot because they are what I would call <em>“meta” birthdays, </em>and are the most influenced by the trump cards. I use the term “<strong>meta</strong>” relating to the <strong>metaphysical</strong>, which means, “<strong>beyond the physical</strong>”.  For example, I would be a “meta-twelve”, and my mother would be a “meta-four”, no pun implied, although metaphorically, her life followed patterns in the 4<sup>th</sup> trump of the Thoth tarot deck too closely for it to be a mere coincidence, which is why I don’t blame her. I have noticed that those born closest to or on those double digit dates have lives closely reflected in the trumps of the tarot, but also in their corresponding court cards.</p>

It also shows the upside-down ankh, and the serpent above (or below) the head of the figure. On the left of this card is an image of the Rosicrucian Cross, which is very similar to the image on the back of the Thoth deck. Given the word Rosicrucian means “Rosy Cross”, and their affiliation with the Catholic Church, it does not surprise me that, as stranger actually yelled out to me in the street in 2009, that I could&#8217;ve been sold into slavery. I believe that is very possible I was sold via my adoption though Catholic Charities, just to be made into a ritual sacrifice. While I cannot blame Catholic Charities directly, it becomes hard for me to deny that such a thing could’ve happened to me, especially when you realize that many people sell their children into experimental programs, and many agencies have been caught in child trafficking. In this card, from the Hermetic Tarot, is the trident symbol for Neptune, which is usually associated with the devil. Since my astrological planet is Jupiter, the fact that there is a symbol for Neptune in the 12<sup>th</sup> trump of this deck, tells me that someone purposely put the energy of Neptune near the already upside-down figure. The fact that I had a near drowning at 3 years old, and that many ritual abuse and monarch program victims experience a near drowning at that exact age, tells me that it is no stretch of the imagination to consider that I am the victim of ritual abuse, chosen precisely because of my birthdate, in connection with the various occurrences of that number in our culture, in the Bible, and in the Tarot. It is my understanding that the ritual drowning at 3 years old is done to open the child up to spirits and demons. There are over 1,000 Tarot decks in existence today, with untold printings of each deck.  In terms of quantum mechanics, the sheer number of those cards, with that upside-down vibration, would amplify the energy of that vibration, possibly affecting anyone born on this date, <em>even if intent wasn’t involved</em>. However, if someone intentionally used occult magic to tie an <strong>unwitting victim</strong> to specific cards and/or decks of the Tarot, while keeping the victim unaware of it, except on a subconscious level, the victim would inadvertantly attract negativity, never understanding the reason. They would always feel like something was terribly wrong in life, never really being able to pin point why. I cannot avoid the reality about the state of our world, regarding how natural resources are stolen from one country by another, and how corporations steal ideas and harm people, it is not too far of a jump to imagine someone using occult magic on a person, in order to cause a state of misery, thereby generating compelling and creative ideas in the subconscious to be gleaned from the victim and channeled to certain supported people in the music, television, and movie industries. It fits right in with the way so many very wealthy people have attained their wealth by profiting from other people’s suffering. If I had never seen these cards until my late thirties, how did they have such a strong impact on my personal life? Could it have something to do with Chaos Theory, Quantum Mechanics, and/or the Collective Subconscious?</p>

Could the 12/12, being the highest meta-birthdate on the current calendar, also be the fool? Could the vibration of the Fool card also manifest itself in the person born on 1/1, being the next meta-birthdate after the 12/12? What is odd to me is that many of the items displayed on this card apply to various issues in my life. In this image, I see the following items: the dove, which is supposed to mean “peace”, which is what I was trying to achieve; the horns, representing the implants in my head; the monarch butterfly, which should be obvious to he read, as it represents the Monarch program of mind control; the bluebird, representing the Bluebird mind control project and/or project Bluebeam; the sun right at the crotch, representing the burning/electrocution sensations in that area I suffer from; the DNA/lizard/winged disk, which has to do with everything I had been learning about, including that darned tattoo on my back; the character holding the crystal because I used to study crystals and work with them for energy healing; also holding the wheat, representing when I was learning about herbs ad their medicinal value; the bag of runes, which I had just begun to learn about; the gator at bottom, representing my mother whose maiden name was Gaeta; the grapes, representing either grapes of wrath or wine or both; the Tiger biting the leg, which is really strange because I have sensations on the left leg, as if something is biting or pinching me there; the flowers I don’t want to discuss; the two babies at the bottom represent two people enjoying the results of the pain I am suffering from, which from what I understand, are freemasons who have what is called “full access to the seether”, thus making me “the seether”. Those two babies are babies because they refuse to see the truth of how they are accessing their inspiration.</p>

Knowing that I had serious, but subconscious issues in my life, I had to look inside myself to uncover what went wrong in my life, so that I could try to correct myself, not knowing about the curse I had been living under. Not satisfied with the way I was raised, I was determined to be better to my daughter, than my mother had the ability to be to me. It seems cruelly ironic that my whole life fell completely apart when, and the way, it did. It happened at a point when I first began to learn, apophatically, how I wanted to raise my own child, and it also happened right at the point that I began to have memories surface of the way I was mistreated. So that, when I made a conscious effort to become a better mother, my child was taken away from me, as if some force did not want me to change the negative pattern that had been set into motion long before I was even born. It seems like there has always been some force in my life, making sure that  would never have a fair shot in  life, tying me to this particular deck of cards, which sadly enough have the Rosicrucian Cross on the back of each card. To me, it seems obvious why the left arm of the cross is blue, and the right is red. Taken on a political level, the connotation is obvious. Taken on a verbal level, well, that connotation is obvious as well.</p>

At the risk of sounding a bit vulgar, I must mention this in current terms, i.e. the word mal meaning:  Both crosses show blue on the left (right to the viewer), and red on the right, implying that red is “right”, and blue is “wrong”. So while the OTO, to which Crowley belonged, has the bottom of the cross as navy in color, the RC cross shows the same area as green, brown, olive, and black, which are the colors of the lowest sphere, kingdom, in the cabbala, which is Malkuth. Consider that name, and what the first syllable “mal” which carries a negative meaning (“bad, wrongful, or ill” from <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com" rel="nofollow">http://dictionary.reference.com</a>) in almost every word in which it is the root, at least in the English language, which is the most accepted, language spoken, in most countries. Incidentally, one of the spheres of the Kabbalistic Tree is called “Chokmah”, which phonetically denotes a malefic intent, as in “choking ma”. <strong>What I think people don’t understand is the phonetic symbolism involved in mind control, in addition to symbolism</strong>. I remember an author, M. Tsarion, speaking of the group called the Atonists in relation to the number 10, which makes me think of how the Kabbalah shows the kingdom, Malkuth, as the 10<sup>th</sup> sphere (connotating that the atonists are ruling the so-called “kingdom”, a scary thought indeed); however it is still at the bottom. In the Cabalistic Tree there are either ten or eleven spheres. They often omit the 11<sup>th</sup> sphere, called Da’ath, which is connected to Knowledge. I have to wonder if they, like those who instigated the event on 9/11 which destroyed the twin towers in NY, as well as tower 7 (a number associated with God and luck), were involved in this, specifically because they do not want justice (the traditional 11<sup>th</sup> trump of the tarot) or knowledge to exist in our world. Considering how I have become targeted, I have to wonder if everyone involved in my targeting also feels <a href="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/imagescaal8atd.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="243" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2012/09/11/symbolism-mind-control-and-metaphysical-sabotage-in-relation-to-archetypal-transference-and-the-second-commandment-of-the-decalogue/imagescaal8atd/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/imagescaal8atd.jpg" data-orig-size="157,321" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="imagesCAAL8ATD" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/imagescaal8atd.jpg?w=147" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/imagescaal8atd.jpg?w=157" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-243" title="imagesCAAL8ATD" alt="Cabalistic Tree of Life" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/imagescaal8atd.jpg?w=73&#038;h=150" width="73" height="150" srcset="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/imagescaal8atd.jpg?w=73&amp;h=150 73w, https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/imagescaal8atd.jpg?w=146&amp;h=300 146w" sizes="(max-width: 73px) 100vw, 73px" /></a>this way- like they want no justice. The 11<sup>th</sup> sphere in the Cabalistic Tree of Life represents knowledge. Perhaps those targeting me, those involved in my smear campaign, do not want either knowledge (truth) or justice to prevail.</p>
<p><strong>Missing God:</strong></p>
<p>I had been missing God in my life, as well as my parents, and I had become a rather negative and dark teenager, which I believe, opened me up to something very negative. Because of my parent’s behavior, which contradicted the tenets of the bible, I grew up very confused about God. We went to church, but only until my parent’s divorce when I was 8 or 9 years old. Throughout my childhood, my parents were rarely around, leaving me in the care of various nannies, while my parents were still married, and left alone after their divorce, making me easily influenced by others, especially men. Untrusting of the Bible in general, due to its treatment of women, I had an overall, mistrust of religion. My state of misery in life led me to believe that perhaps God hated me and cursed me himself. After learning about the Tarot, specifically the 12<sup>th</sup> trump, and its uncanny connection to my life, which has been metaphorically upside-down, events and situations in my life began to make sense. I no longer believe that God has cursed me, and in fact, might’ve tried to protect me via the Bible, with the commandment regarding, “Graven Images”. It seemed to me like this had been done to me on purpose, to make me some sort of a sacrifice, because of what this curse eventually led me to do.</p>
<p><strong>MK Ultra and the Serpent in the Tarot:</strong></p>
<p>Ironically, when I consider my situation, I am reminded of a couple of songs by the band, aptly named “Muse”. These songs are “MK Ultra”, which describes a specific mind control program, and “Unnatural Selection”, because it seems like I was selected at birth, via a catholic adoption, so that my whole life could be <em>engineered</em> to keep me down, upside-down, and unconscious, unnaturally, so that some others could benefit from the emotional turmoil generated by such a state. I was being mentally and emotionally drained for real, meanwhile, I would see others being gifted with my own thoughts and feelings, and would watch them profit from my <a href="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpludovica1.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="245" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2012/09/11/symbolism-mind-control-and-metaphysical-sabotage-in-relation-to-archetypal-transference-and-the-second-commandment-of-the-decalogue/12thtrumpludovica-2/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpludovica1.jpg" data-orig-size="305,400" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="12thTrumpLudovica" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpludovica1.jpg?w=229" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpludovica1.jpg?w=305" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-245" title="12thTrumpLudovica" alt="Hanged Man card from Ludovica Tarot" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpludovica1.jpg?w=114&#038;h=150" width="114" height="150" srcset="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpludovica1.jpg?w=114&amp;h=150 114w, https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpludovica1.jpg?w=228&amp;h=300 228w" sizes="(max-width: 114px) 100vw, 114px" /></a>suffering. The image to the right, while not from a deck, is a painting done by Ludovica Wing Shuen Price, which seems to illustrate what I have been going through. Her work can be found here: <a href="http://www.elfwood.com/art/l/u/ludovica/the_hanged_man.jpg.html">http://www.elfwood.com/art/l/u/ludovica/the_hanged_man.jpg.html</a>. Again, we see an upside-down ankh, the Egyptian symbol for life and fertility. <strong>The serpent, connected to the head of the Hanged Man card (the 12<sup>th</sup> trump) in at least 2 tarot decks, seems to have allowed either the serpent class, or Satan himself, to have direct access to my subconscious mind, on a metaphysical level.</strong> The fact that I have seen so many movies and television (tell-a-vision) shows, and have heard so many songs that have an uncanny relation to aspects of my life, tells me that this could very well be the case, regardless of how bizarre this may seem. While I love the music and the movies that show <em>some</em> of my own story (because it’s never the whole story), it still makes me angry to have been stolen from in this metaphysical way. So much has been stolen from me, that no monetary award could ever pay it back, although it sure would help.</p>
<p>It seems to me that Crowley and Harris, the creators of the Thoth tarot deck, and those who followed some of their patterns, were the cause of what could be a type of <strong>metaphysical slavery, caused by chaos magic</strong>, whereby the serpent (or serpent class), who is placed at the head of the victim in the 12<sup>th</sup> trump, has unauthorized access to all creative ideas and inspiration, brought about by the upside-down condition of the victim in this card, to be used and changed anyway the serpent/thief sees fit (through music, movies, and/or television), to make it less obvious to the victim that it represents some aspect of his or her life. Given what people now know about the amplification of a vibration, is it any wonder that someone born on 12/12 would have issues? What is worse is the fact that my numerology has me as an 11, which is supposed to be a so-called “master” number, but if your birthdate is 12/12 (which pushes the upside-down or reversed position), it becomes a bad combination. In the Tarot, the 11<sup>th</sup> trump was normally the “Justice” card, but in the Thoth deck it was changed to “Lust”. While I cannot point to the reason that I have been so closely tied to the Thoth deck, it seems to have had its impact on my life as well as my mother’s (4/4).</p>
<p><strong>Metaphysical Rape Plus Implants Equals Scapegoat:</strong></p>
<p>What is mentioned in the above paragraph, if even remotely applicable, is tantamount to what could be called “<strong>mind rape</strong>”, and is what I refer to as a “<strong>Meta Crime</strong>”. Yet, it is not the worst result of the precarious situation in which I was placed, at my birth and without my knowledge. The most disturbing effect of the circumstances of my life is that my turmoil eventually led me to do exactly what mind control, via programming and occult magic, had set me up to do. Before I continue, I must mention that I have discovered what I can only believe are possibly RFID implants (images below), one in front of each ear, because I am now hearing voices and receiving some sort of energetic vibrations through them. Is it possible that these two nodules in front of each ear helped to push me over the edge, by being conduits for subliminal messages, influencing my mind during my sleep? Was it not enough that I was living under this curse my whole life? It is a miracle that I didn’t end up much worse than I did. I say this at a time when, while there are actual murderers and rapists running free, private people who aren’t breaking any laws are now being electronically harassed and targeted by directed energy weapons. In this way, 2012 is turning out to be an upside-down year indeed. Below are photos of my RFID implants, which possibly helped to put me in the miserable situation I now find myself in today. Since I have discovered these implants, I have become a target of the most hideous nightmare, making me wonder if I was some unwitting participant in a government mind control program, whereby they were used to input subliminal messages into my mind during my sleep, possibly triggering me to do things that I wouldn’t have done, had I not been mind controlled.</p>

<p>As you can see from the first two images, these implants cannot be seen until I lightly pull back on my ear. Voices coming through these implants tell me that I am a demon or the devil himself, saying that these things are horns. Well, if anything, <strong>I was made a scapegoat at birth</strong>, sold into slavery via a Catholic adoption, implanted, so that some nefarious force could then manipulate me into being emotionally damaged, and get those around me to believe that I am something I’m not: evil. I have had a professional psychologist try to tell me these things in my ears are keloids, but keloids are scars that are raised above the skin. Here is a photo to prove my point. <a href="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/keyloidc.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="53" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2012/06/28/born-into-slavery/keyloidc/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/keyloidc.jpg" data-orig-size="254,198" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Keyloid Scars Do Not Look Like My Implants Do" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/keyloidc.jpg?w=254" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/keyloidc.jpg?w=254" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-53" title="Keyloid Scars" alt="Keloid Example" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/keyloidc.jpg?w=150&#038;h=116" width="150" height="116" srcset="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/keyloidc.jpg?w=150&amp;h=116 150w, https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/keyloidc.jpg 254w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a></p>
<p>If they are implants, when were they implanted? If they aren’t implants, then what are they? I have heard voices coming through them since 2008, however, I have no idea of how long they have been there, and so they may have been influencing me on a subliminal level my whole life. Since I was held in custody of the agency for the first 6 weeks of my life, they may have been implanted very shortly after my birth. I was allowed to play in the woods by myself at the ages of 6 and 7, so I could have been abducted for the procedure during that time. It might have happened when I had my wisdom teeth removed when I was 17 years old, under a general anesthetic. However, it could have occurred much later, during a dental surgery in 2001 or during a cervical cone biopsy in 2004, both under general anesthetic. That being said, I believe I would have felt some pain in the area if they were put in at any time other than my birth. <strong>They say that babies don’t feel pain at birth. I believe this is a lie, and the truth is that babies feel pain and repress the memory of it</strong>. At any rate, it is very possible that I was under some form of post hypnotic suggestion when I made the gravest mistake of my life, for which I am continually begging God for forgiveness, on the grounds that I was not in my right mind when I did it.</p>
<p><strong>My Gravest Mistake, Done While Searching for God:</strong></p>
<p>What was the gravest mistake of my life? Dare I say it? I preface the admonition with <em>the desire for the True and Just God to know everything behind such a rash decision</em>: the fact that I felt so separated from God throughout my life; the fact that I had previously undergone certain traumas which had been repressed in my memory, but obviously had the effect of torturing my mind on the subconscious level; the fact that I was living under an occult curse my whole life; the fact that I was held in custody of Catholic Charities for the first 6 weeks of my life, causing attachment disorder; the fact that my God-given natural left-handedness was taken away from me; the fact that I never had any stable caregivers in my youth; the fact that I spent the second half of my childhood in a virtual “house of mirrors”; the fact that I was suffering from an attachment disorder caused by my adoption and the lack of parental influence; the fact that my own mother had me selling hotdogs at construction sites in a bikini, when I was 14 years old; the fact that I was raped when I was 16 years old by a man who was 21; the fact that my mother allowed me to be prosecuted for a crime I didn’t commit when I was 17; the fact that I had been mistreated by authorities and medical professionals throughout my life; the fact that I was implanted without my knowledge or consent; and the fact that I was overburdened with too many responsibilities, in an unaffordable and chaotic house after my daughter was born, which is when it happened… all of these things had an influence on causing me to make a huge mistake in my life, that would change everything. I bring these things to the surface in an effort to prove to God why I deserve forgiveness.</p>
<p>Of course, there are other variables involved in my decision. I was involved in an online spiritual group, which I now see was not quite that spiritual. I joined the group because I had been learning about Reiki and other energy healing modalities. It was called “Wingmakers for Humanity/Masters of the Shamballa 1024” (which is no longer active), and the leader, named June, was some sort of spiritual predator, who, after I had been in the group for about a year, posted that she was altering people’s merkabas and using a technique known as “mind-bending”. At one point, she even said she was “harvesting souls”, which is downright evil. Since then, I have heard of an online group known as “Freedom from Mindbenders”, which is now also no longer active (at my last check), which concerns me. I have to note here, that almost every female in that group was suffering from some sort of chronic pain. While in her group, this woman was sensitizing people to programming in movies, said she was doing energy work on people like Hillary Clinton (when she was running for president), and was encouraging members of the group to judge people for their behavior.</p>
<p>I had been searching for God, and reading all these things on the internet about how Enki was this Sumerian deity who loved human beings and wanted to help us. I had read an abundance of information, which convinced me, in my chaotic state, that the name “Satan” was a name given to the true God, by the false religion of Christianity, which has the history of The Crusades, in which people were tortured and murdered for their beliefs. I had also read about a location in the Middle East that was actually called “Satan”. Given that my whole life had been engineered by some very nefarious forces, to be aligned with the Thoth tarot without my knowledge, I was confused and easily misled. I signed a contract with this entity, believing that he would help human beings, including myself, to reach a connection with God. It seems to me that knowledge was kept from me my whole life by cursing me in this way, so they could later get me to sell myself out, by using symbolic and predictive programming, <em>knowing that I would be seeking out the God I felt I had been missing my whole life</em>.</p>
<p>I believe that none of this would have happened, had I not been so metaphysically tied to that tarot deck, and had I not been implanted with RFID chips in my ears, allowing for subliminal messaging. There are too many images in that deck that relate to my life in very specific ways for it to have been an accident. This is why I feel it was an occult curse put on me, as a newborn. Considering the fact that there is a serpent at the head of the figure on the 12<sup>th</sup> trump, tells me that someone knowingly allowed Satan to influence me throughout my life, without my knowledge.  I have been told that Satan cannot “steal” souls, but this is certainly what has happened in my case. This is why I am appealing to the True and Just God of the Universe, the one who loves truth, to see every one of the circumstances in my life that led me down the negative path, and to allow me into heaven, or at the very least, to not allow me to go to hell.</p>
<p><strong>My Mother, The Emperor:</strong></p>

This image of the 4<sup>th</sup> trump shows various people in her life, symbolized by the figures surrounding the main figure, who is “The Emperor”. The two rams behind the figure represent the two Aries in my mother’s life, who supported her. My grandmother died and is shown in the transparent ram, while my father was still alive when my mother died, and is shown by the more opaque ram. The two, eight-point stars on either side of the emperor figure represent my brother and my cousin, both born on 8/4. The lamb at her feet must represent me, because I supported certain causes, such as the baby harp seals, and the environment when I was young, and this is shown by the flag. The ball in the emperor’s hand is represented in my mother’s life by the fact that she was an avid, trophy-winning bowler. This is a powerful figure, and my mother had power in her life, seemingly attracting whatever she needed. Near the end of her life, she was driving a Cadillac, bought for her by an ex-boyfriend. In this card, she is looking away from me, and I am on the floor, at her feet, symbolic of how she always put me down, even as a small child, but never invested much time in me, to help me grow up to become someone she could be proud of. Is it a coincidence that the figure on the 12<sup>th</sup> trump has their legs folded in the position of the number four? Is the poor victim in the 12<sup>th</sup> trump trying to tell people that the Emperor is responsible? If my mother never saw these cards, or was not an adept in the occult, how did they have such an exacting impact on her life? Could it have something to do with the sheer number of these decks in print, in relation to the collective consciousness?</p>
<p><strong>The Devil was Screwing Me (Pardon my French):</strong></p>
<p>The following is another example of how this Tarot curse manifested in my life: I was an aspiring artist, who had enough talent to be given an art scholarship by the instructors at the school I was attending. Given the fact that<a href="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/1sttrumpthotha.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="254" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2012/09/11/symbolism-mind-control-and-metaphysical-sabotage-in-relation-to-archetypal-transference-and-the-second-commandment-of-the-decalogue/1sttrumpthotha/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/1sttrumpthotha.jpg" data-orig-size="183,275" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="1stTrumpThothA" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/1sttrumpthotha.jpg?w=183" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/1sttrumpthotha.jpg?w=183" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-254" title="1stTrumpThothA" alt="One of Three Magi Cards from Thoth Tarot" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/1sttrumpthotha.jpg?w=99&#038;h=150" width="99" height="150" srcset="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/1sttrumpthotha.jpg?w=99&amp;h=150 99w, https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/1sttrumpthotha.jpg 183w" sizes="(max-width: 99px) 100vw, 99px" /></a> my initials spell CAT, I find it cruelly ironic that my career and my life were destroyed by a fellow student with the last name of “Skinner”, when she introduced me to a drug called heroin. I would eventually see her steal my ideas, and use them for her own advancement. Additionally strange is how this person, who helped to destroy my career, looks suspiciously like the person on one of the three Magi cards of the Thoth deck. The card I am speaking of, to the right, is the one with a woman standing behind an image of a winged disk, so that it is directly in front of her crotch. The winged disk looks suspiciously like a tattoo I have on my back, which alludes to the fact that this woman “screwed” me. When I got the tattoo done, I had not yet been aware of the winged disk or its connection to Egyptian or Sumerian lore. Was I mind controlled into getting that tattoo, so that it could be used against me later?</p>

This image is the 15<sup>th</sup> trump of the Thoth deck, which is called “The Devil” card. To the left of this card is a shadow that strangely reminds me of the Millenium Falcon in the Star Wars movies, and to the right, is a shadow that reminds me of a pose I have seen of Kate Bush, wherein she is perched upon something in just such a position. The winged disk, which looks suspiciously like to my tattoo, is directly in front of the devil character. Regardless of the meanings of these cards in a personal Tarot reading, each time someone sees these cards, as with any image or symbol, the deeper, metaphysical meaning of it is subconsciously inserted into the mind. This is what might have happened to James Holmes when he saw the Lil Wayne Video of his song appropriately called, “My Homies” (photo at top of document). This concept then begs the question: “Is it possible that every time someone views these cards, they also go into the collective subconscious, along with their intended subversive meaning, created by an occult theocracy?”</p>
<p><strong>Abandoned, and The Trauma Begins:</strong></p>
<p>Things had been looking up in 2008, or so I thought. After a lifetime of disappointments, including the loss of my art career, I was finally finding my niche, or so I thought. I was writing articles for a company that sold crystals on the internet, a job which I truly loved, even though I wasn’t paid what most article writers were getting at the time. While most people writing articles on the internet were getting up to $700.00 per article, I was lucky to get, at most, $60.00. Still, I loved and appreciated my job very much, and it allowed me to stay home with my daughter, who was around 2 years old when I started that job.</p>
<p>In less than two years, everything came crashing down, and I found myself living in a foreclosed house, with no power or water, in acute and constant physical pain. The cause of this was the fact that in 2008, I began to hear voices that told me I was a kind of “Virgin Mary” and that I would receive an immaculate conception from God (funny how I played the Virgin Mary in a school Christmas pageant when I was around 7 years old). I know it sounds crazy, but given those photos of the implants in my head, it doesn’t seem so crazy anymore. At one point, I actually could feel something inside of me, making me believe it had actually happened, but was told that an archangel did it to me. Was I programmed by the Catholic religion, when I was too young to remember, for this to happen to me later in life? Like a fool, I began to tell certain people that I thought it was really happening. Of course they all thought I was crazy. The voice told me that it would come and get me, but that eventually, we would all get together again, with our correct soul-mates. My packing my things in preparation for this was what pushed Jerome over the edge and made him have me Baker Acted. I found myself in a state-run mental facility. I felt like my mind was falling apart. Jerome would try to have me locked up three times, which would then cost me my job.</p>
<p>My psychosis was artificially induced by these voices through the implants. Later, after being abandoned in that house, the voice would then convince me that I was some kind of Jesus and had to be sacrificed. Then they would tell me I was an angel. All of that reminds me now of a band called “Jesus and the Mary Chain”. When that was happening, I was not yet aware of the occult curse, under which I had been living, and how it caused me to make the gravest mistake of my life. Once Jerome left, the house went into foreclosure, the power and water eventually were shut off. I was then only able to see my daughter once a month.</p>
<p>As I lived in that house, with no power or water, for at least 2.5 years beginning at the end of 2008, I was suffering the worst pain of my life. During the first 3 months of it, I was literally on the floor screaming. The pain started in September, and in October, I went to a neighbor’s house to call an ambulance. It was at this point, when I began to notice how people in the medical profession were mistreating me, and had been, even when I was younger. Apparently, I had sublimated those memories, because I didn’t want to believe that my whole life had been orchestrated in this way. In the emergency room, that day, I was told that, although I didn’t have a venereal disease, they were going to treat it like one and send me home.</p>
<p>At that time, I was going to a clinic, to try to get some help. I was in solid pain, and in order to get rides, I had to kiss one of my neighbors, which was debasing. Sometimes, marijuana would help my pain, but the only way I could get some was to kiss a neighbor. Currently, I am not on any type of pain relievers and refuse to do anything illegal, despite my severe and constant pain.</p>
<p>While I was living in the foreclosed house, I had to collect rain water in storage bins, to keep myself relatively clean. I could only eat items that did not need to be refrigerated, and kept a few things that were refrigerated at neighbor’s houses. When I did cook, I had to use a gutted toaster oven, with the pan or pot on top, and a fire of newspaper and tree limbs inside the gutted part. In the hottest weather, I had to wear only bra and underwear with windows wide open to ward off heat exhaustion. Who knows who might’ve been peering in those windows. In the coldest weather, I had to sleep with at least twenty candles burning, to keep from freezing. I inhaled allot of smoke during those times, and suffered a great deal of trauma, including the event where I was terrorized by a helicopter for a solid half an hour in the middle of the night. I would collect decent items that were being thrown out to sell at garage sales to make a few bucks to survive off of. Once in a while, on the coldest nights, a neighbor would let me stay on his couch, but only if I kissed him, which was humiliating and added to the traumatic effect of the whole experience.</p>
<p>It was during this time that I was hearing voices, making me believe that God was talking to me. I was so miserable at that time because I felt abandoned by everyone. My own mother wouldn’t let me come and stay with her. I am not blaming her, because I know people thought I was crazy. I heard a voice tell me to purchase the Thoth Tarot, which I did after some garage sales to work up the money. When I began to look at those archetypes, I realized that my whole life seemed cursed by them. As I mentioned above, it is as if all those decks, with their archetypal memes being digested by all those people, further infected the collective unconscious and intensified the Hanged Man’s deleterious effect on me in the more recent years. I see this as one of the biggest reasons why the Bible states “No Graven Images”: Because these graven images become <strong>archetypes</strong>, which then <strong>engraved</strong> onto the collective unconscious, and effectively destroy (or at least hinder) many people’s freewill. Unfortunately, most people do not read the commandment that way.</p>
<p>It was also during that time when I felt like something was etherically raping me. It seemed to do something to my mind. The voice told me it loved me and would come to rescue me soon. I don’t know if I was being poisoned, if the implants were working on my subconscious mind during my sleep and my conscious mind when I was awake, or how they were able to mess my head up so much, but they did. Every day while I was living in absolute poverty with hardly any money to my name, I would hear the voice of someone I truly admired saying they were coming to rescue me. It was always, “I’ll be there tomorrow, I promise”, or “I’m coming tonight, don’t worry”, but the rescuer never showed, and I felt more and more like committing suicide, but knew that I couldn’t. So it seems in my case, mind control had been done on me using both the occult and technology.</p>
<p><strong>I Hope God Loves the Truth:</strong></p>
<p>Given what has happened and what is still happening to me, I feel I am being attacked by demonic entities, yet part of me thinks that this isn’t about God, religion, demons, or about anything spiritual. I say this because <strong>the Bible speaks of God loving the Truth. </strong>If this were true, then I would not be suffering in this way right now. If God really does love the truth, then that being would not allow me to suffer eternally because of what some very cruel and adept people designed, using the tarot. It is very possible that the conspiracy theorists are correct in that there is a certain portion of the population that is being culled, sold at birth, often through adoption, as sacrifices to some very nefarious beings out there. By putting implants in our heads, they could easily influence us throughout our sad lives, on a subliminal level, during our sleep, so that we would never have any tangible proof of the fact that we have been victims of some very evil program. We were selected at birth, to be cursed and mistreated, so that we would eventually become negative, so that certain people could then justify writing us off later on, handing our names over to those they call “gang-stalkers”. I have come to this conclusion after being in contact with several individuals, who have been suffering just as I have, who have spoken about their parents, being overheard having meetings with some people who then argued about said child, behind closed doors. I personally am aware that my adoptive father had some secretive dealings, in which he would turn off the dome light in the vehicle, before opening the door to get out for a meeting with someone, which tells me this might be the case for me as well. This tells me that the so-called game was always fixed, and that certain people were allowed to reap benefits from those of us who were suffering at the hands of the occult theocracy, which used occult, metaphysical strategies, in addition to orchestrating circumstances in the victim’s life, such as, dealing with authorities and doctors.</p>
<p>In my case, my interactions with authorities included a record from my life that was supposed to have been expunged, since I had met all the requirements in order to do so, yet years later, I found that it had not been expunged. Regarding doctors, I remember seeing a doctor who gave me a pelvic exam for stomach problems, and then left the speculum in for 45 minutes, while he left the exam room. More recently, I went to the emergency room for severe pelvic pain, and they recorded “belly pain”.</p>

<p>The Vatican denies there is any negative intent involved in the use of this upside-down symbol (of course), by saying it represents the crucifixion of St. Peter, however, it is my contention that the use of this symbol in this position, which is seen by millions of people who visit the pope, exemplifies and amplifies the upside-down nature of religion in general, but especially when it is an organization so involved in child-trafficking as the Catholic Church is. Being adopted through a Catholic agency, and knowing how the Catholic church has been indicted recently for child-trafficking, I cannot ignore the possibility that I was indeed sold into slavery to be some part of a very nasty plan, designed to keep certain people from having any true freewill, which means that the contract I signed was not done of my freewill, and therefore, I cannot legally or spiritually, be held liable. <strong>The ends do not justify the means, in my opinion, and it goes against God’s will and/or natural law, in that human beings are supposed to have freewill, a quality that I was never truly given</strong>.</p>
<p>There are those in this world who speak of “Christ consciousness”. What happens when one tries to embody such a thing? While much of my life was lived negatively, as a result of this whole upside-down vibration enforced upon me with intent, when I did truly try to embody this thing called “Christ consciousness”, something, some energy came in, as if to try to stop me from being the good I so wanted to be.</p>
<p><strong>Double Bind – Double Cross:</strong></p>
<p>There is something common in mind control programming called a “<strong>double-bind</strong>”. From Dictionary.com: “Psychology- it is <strong>a situation in which a person is given conflicting cues, especially by a parent, such that to obey one cue is to disobey the other</strong>.” From <a href="http://www.laingsociety.org">www.laingsociety.org</a>: “A second variation of the double bind involves <strong>a situation in which a person is chastised for a correct perception of the outside world</strong>. In this situation the child will learn to distrust his own sensory awareness in favor of the parent&#8217;s assessment of the situation. One example would be the child who is raised in a violent household but is expected to see his parents as loving and peaceful. In later life this person will have a difficult time determining how to behave appropriately in a variety of situations. Indeed, this person will spend an inordinate amount of energy trying to decipher exactly how he &#8220;should&#8221; interpret the situation.”</p>
<p>For more information on how symbolism has been used to destroy lives, please see Michael Tsarion’s video entitled, “The Subversive Use of Sacred Symbolism”. Then please notice how the person delivering the lecture is wearing a double cross, and what that might mean. In this lecture, he states that studying the tarot can both help and harm people. By studying what are truly graven images, these people are amplifying an energy that sacrifices people who do not deserve to be sacrificed. They may not even realize what is happening, for all I know. Keep in mind, that while I greatly admire his work on one hand, I now have a deep mistrust of those with any amount of authority, even if only on an intellectual level.</p>
<p><strong>Life on Life’s Terms Without Freewill:</strong></p>
<p>I would add to this, that there is a fundamental double-bind problem in the Bible, for any Christians who think that believing in Jesus as the “son of God” will save them. The Torah has set rules for living, including ritual blood sacrifice. Christians believe that Jesus was the last blood sacrifice, and there is no need for the practice anymore. Therefore, the person who is being triggered constantly by monarch-type programming, to believe that they are a ritual sacrifice, might feel that the way things are set up is unfair, and that they have not been granted freewill. This feeling will be called blasphemy by those involved in gang-stalking or using electronic harassment against the victim, using the bible as the standard. <strong>The victim of a set-up, such as the 12<sup>th</sup> trump could have never truly had freewill because their whole life has been upside-down, making it impossible for them to “live life on life’s terms” so-to-speak, because life’s terms have been completely skewed for them, which makes this a DOUBLE-BIND. </strong>Having a person metaphorically and metaphysically upside-down, allowing the serpent to drain them of the fruits of their labor (being attached to their head), <strong>is slavery on a level unknown to those who are not adept in the occult</strong>.</p>
<p>The Tarot, with the 12<sup>th</sup> trump, also advocates such a thing, especially in the Thoth, and Hermetic decks, where there is a serpent (representing the serpent class), sucking all creativity and inspiration out of the head of the upside-down person, which ends up in multiple songs, T.V. shows, movies, in various forms.</p>
<p>In the Thoth deck, the 12<sup>th</sup> trump is also called “The Dying God”. Does this show a Neitzche-esque negative and subversive occult intent?</p>
<p>For more information on the use of symbolism in mind control, please see Michael Tsarion’s video on the subject, with discerning eyes.

a few things, the most notable being A) the Egyptian hieroglyph for female is<br />
most certainly not an image of a serpent (which is what I have seen him say in<br />
one of his lectures, rather it is an image of a female, sitting down; and B)<br />
the tarot could not have influenced the Torah, since the tarot has only been<br />
around since the 1600s at the earliest, and the Torah is believed to have been<br />
written around 1450 BCE. The image to the right is the High Priestess card from the Rider-Waite deck, which was first published in 1901. That being said, the video, “The Subversive Use of Sacred Symbolism”, which can be found on YouTube, is packed with information about symbolism, which is how I first became aware of the symbolic aspect of Mind Control.  As a result of the so-called “sacred” symbolism of the Tarot, I have found that my life lacked any true freewill. I have to ask myself the following question: Did the amplified vibration of the Tarot, due to so many printings of these graven images, in relation to my birthday and my numerology cause me to become reversed from my natural tendencies, even as a child (i.e. lefty turned right)? It certainly had an effect on my mother. At the risk of being labeled by those who support astrology and Tarot, it seems to me that, for anyone to truly have freewill, we would have to abolish both the Tarot as well as the astrological signs as applied to birthdates, to avoid the unnatural archetypal transference that seems to infect many. While they may indeed be interesting works of art, I have seen how they had negative effects on me as well as others. Looking back on my own life, I know that I created some very angry and therefore ugly art, possibly as a direct result of being metaphorically upside-down. So, as a result of the graven images that affected me, I also created graven images, for which I am truly sorry. An interesting side note here is that my original sign would have been Ophiuchus, which is a very strong sign, and had it not been removed from the zodiac, I might have had more of a chance against this curse.</p>

<p><strong>A Remedy, Anyone?:</strong></p>
<p>So what is the remedy for such a thing? I have read numerous articles stating that freewill is an illusion. In my case, this certainly seems true. I have been suffering as a result of my lacking any true freewill, due to the graven images of the Tarot. If there is no freewill, then a reasonable, true, and just God would not hold the victim of such a curse responsible for their reactions to this curse. In fact, I would venture to say that the reactions were involved in the agenda for creating the Tarot in the first place. Creating, and placing such importance on, these archetypes would seem to destroy freewill with pervasive memes. I would hope that in the end of it all, all would be forgiven, since no one, especially living in the years surrounding and including 2012, which have been affected by the negative memes resulting from possibly millions of printings of the 12<sup>th</sup> trump, the Hanged Man, or Dying God in the Thoth deck.</p>
<p>Despite the facts surrounding my adoption through a catholic agency and the fact that the Catholic Church has been indicted for child trafficking, I have so far been unable to get any help from so-called victims advocate groups online. There seems to be a great deal of money in making people into ritual sacrifices, because it seems like every official or representative has been bought off in some way, to keep people like me from getting any real help. I seem to be living in some sort of occult nightmare, in which those people, who are in positions to help people like me, do not care to do so.</p>
<p>By the way, this:</p>

<p align="center"><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">How to Make Someone Sell Their Soul Against Their Will</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>History is written by the winners, and the Muse is the exploited loser. If you espouse the truth, I beg you to read this story. If nothing else, please read the list below.</strong><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;"> </span></strong></p>
<p><strong>MU: “the 12th letter of the Greek alphabet”. </strong></p>
<p><strong>SIC: &#8220;as written&#8221;</strong> (From Wikipedia: The <a title="Adverb" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverb">adverb</a> <em>sic</em> – meaning &#8220;<strong>intentionally so written</strong>&#8220;, first appeared in English circa 1856);<strong> &#8220;unwell or ill&#8221;</strong>; or as in &#8220;sic the dog&#8221;. Consider that <strong>“MUSIC” can be read as &#8220;12 AS WRITTEN&#8221;</strong> or <strong>“12 ILL”</strong>.</p>
<p>Of course, one can also consider that word in the form, “<strong>MUSE SICK</strong>”.</p>
<p>“<em>Life imitates art far more than art imitates life</em>” – Oscar Wilde</p>
<p>I will add to the above statement that,<em> if you happen to be born on 12/12, it can be that your life imitates art far more than what you or anyone around you are willing to believe. </em></p>
<p>If you happen to be unfortunate enough to have a birthday in December, you may have noticed that your life follows a particular pattern relating to movies, and books, but especially <em>mu-sic</em> which can be seen as <em>12, intentionally so written</em> (as noted above). If your name somehow relates to an animal, then you may be more sensitive than most. My friend the muse has been exploited to provide material for others to profit from, while she has received nothing but pain and suffering. <strong>The only comfort I can give her is that none of what has happened in her life can be blamed on her, as</strong> <strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;">she never truly had freewill</span></strong>, which I will prove in the following pages. By turning this woman’s world upside-down (ala 12th trump of the tarot) before she ever had a chance to do something worthwhile in her life, a cache of compelling stories was made, from which authors and musicians have profited, while she has received mostly criticism for not being successful herself.</p>
<p>The Muse may just be a real person. Make the muse sick in an emotional/mental way, and there will be plenty of creative inspiration to draw from her, dolling it out to artists who are supported by the media. <strong>Pray for the muse, for she has suffered. </strong>You may not believe what is written here at first, so you may see it as a fictional account, but I ask that you read it with an open mind, and keep positive thoughts for the unfortunate victims of this strange scheme who get no credit for all they have contributed. The items in the numbered list below may not mean much individually, but when taken all together, <strong>it cannot be denied that this woman’s freewill was taken from her without ever having to incarcerate her</strong> and that it was by design. <strong>She was born innocent and was used, abused, and betrayed from the moment of her birth.</strong></p>
<p><em>This is how the muse has been made:</em></p>
<p>1)      Find a woman who wants to place a baby for adoption, who is due in January to have a female child, as females are generally more submissive and therefore easier to manipulate. Born out of wedlock, the child will be viewed as more expendable, due to how the Bible views bastards (see Deuteronomy 23:2), so no one who is not a so-called bastard will care what happens to her anyway. They’ll just be glad it isn’t them, and will be all too happy to participate in the scam against her.</p>
<p>2)      Induce the birthmother to deliver the baby on 12/12, so that the child is born premature and easier to control, and so that this number’s high visibility in the bible and culture can be used to manipulate her ego throughout her life, without her being consciously aware of it. This will also cause her to be metaphorically and metaphysically tied to the words <em>mu</em> and <em>sic </em>(read as 12-intentionally so written), as noted above and also to the 12<sup>th</sup> trump card of the tarot, which in most decks, is an upsidedown figure, and in at least three decks, there is an upsidedown ankh (which is the symbol for life and fertility, and it closely resembles the sign for female), and a serpent at the head of the figure, which could represent either satan, or the so-called serpent class.</p>
<p>3)      Name her something that has a mostly negative connotation in the culture, such as giving her the initials C.A.T., so that the child can be easily associated with such negative ideas as “catty”, “pussy cat”, “scaredy cat”, “cataclysm”, “catastrophe”, and so on. While there are some positive ideas related to the word cat, such as “catalyst” and “catharsis”, the majority are negative. This creates a negative child with a very low self-esteem, who will be easily manipulated by others, much later. <strong>By making her surroundings as miserable as possible, she will question everything she has been told about a loving god</strong>. By associating her to negative things and by using black magic to associate her on the metaphysical level to mu-sic and the tarot, this task can more easily be accomplished as opposed to just setting her up with a family that pays her little attention. The initials idea has the extra benefit of pointing her out as little more than an animal to the perpetrators. Language will be used to manipulate her in other ways, which will be seen in a paragraph farther below.</p>
<p>4)      By tying the child to the 12<sup>th</sup> trump of the Thoth deck (as opposed to other decks), she will be even more unconscious of what is being done to her. It shows a figure upside-down, eyes closed, arms and one leg pinned with nails, and one leg tied to an upside-down ankh. See the following link to understand this concept. <a href="http://www.metacrawler.com/info.metac.t1.1/search/images?q=thoth%20tarot%20hanged%20man&#038;fcoid=408&#038;fcop=topnav&#038;fpid=2" rel="nofollow">http://www.metacrawler.com/info.metac.t1.1/search/images?q=thoth%20tarot%20hanged%20man&#038;fcoid=408&#038;fcop=topnav&#038;fpid=2</a>                                              <strong>The ankh symbolizes life and fertility, and by being attached to it in an upside-down position, her ideas about those concepts will be terribly skewed, and she will not understand why</strong>. It will affect her for her whole life in a negative way, and then she will be blamed for being so negative. Because the 12<sup>th</sup> trump card is known as the Hanged Traitor in most decks, as she gets older, most people will often see her in a negative light, because of the oc-<span style="text-decoration:underline;">cult</span> underpinnings of our <span style="text-decoration:underline;">cult</span>-ure, and because many people she encounters will have seen or studied the tarot by the time she enters her 40’s. It is ironic because she was betrayed the very moment she was born. Since the Thoth tarot deck names this card as “The Dying God”, it will further manipulate her ego, at a later date.</p>
<p>5)      Her adoptive mother, who was physically abused, has a 4/4 birthday, and is therefore connected to the 4<sup>th</sup> trump card, known as The Emperor, giving her way too much power over her adoptive child. To see the mother’s card, The Emperor, from the Thoth deck, follow this link:     <a href="http://www.metacrawler.com/info.metac.t1.1/search/images?fcoid=417&#038;fcop=topnav&#038;fpid=2&#038;q=thoth+tarot+emperor&#038;ql=" rel="nofollow">http://www.metacrawler.com/info.metac.t1.1/search/images?fcoid=417&#038;fcop=topnav&#038;fpid=2&#038;q=thoth+tarot+emperor&#038;ql=</a></p>
<p>6)      Beyond the 12<sup>th</sup> trump card, the subject will be tied to the Thoth tarot deck in general by using her Pythagorean numerology, in which her numbers are 22, 11, 8, and 2. When one considers Oscar Wilde’s assertion that “Life imitates art far more than art imitates life”, the 11<sup>th</sup> trump of the Thoth deck shows a disturbing discrepancy from decks such as the Rider-Waite, in that it turns what is usually “Justice” into “Lust”. Even more disturbing is that the 9/11 tragedy can be read as “no justice”, since <em>nine</em> in German means “no”, and the 11<sup>th</sup> trump card of the tarot traditionally represents justice.</p>
<p>7)      Television (tell-a-vision) will be her primary babysitter, because it has been known to induce a hypnotic state, making the child more susceptible to post-hypnotic suggestion.</p>
<p>8)      Keeping the subject away from any mother figure for the first six weeks of her life (by keeping her in the custody of the adoption agency during this time), ensures an emotional trauma, known as abandonment syndrome, right from the start, making her easily suggestible even as she gets older. This can be seen in studies on monkeys in captivity, taken from their mothers at birth. To see more information on this, follow this link: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Harlow#Partial_and_total_isolation_of_infant_monkeys">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Harlow#Partial_and_total_isolation_of_infant_monkeys</a></p>
<p>9)      Make sure the parents have a history of abuse in their family. An upper-middle class family with the father away on frequent business trips is important for giving the child daddy issues, which will make her easily influenced by boyfriends in the future. A family that keeps a live-in housekeeper is best, that way the child will never have a stable caregiver. They will have money, so that people will think the subject had “every advantage in life”, when the real thing she needed was love and discipline.</p>
<p>10)  Baptize the child in the Catholic faith, even though the parents are known to have affairs on each other, thus confusing the child early on about God and faith. Get her at least as far as first communion, which is a ritual that does have slightly sexual overtones when taken at face value. The family should already have a male child, who is an alter boy. Abused by his mother, he will pass this on to the sister when she is out of babyhood, introducing more traumas into her life. This brother will be about ten years older than the adoptee and will be favored by the mother. Oddly enough, but it will make sense later on, he will give her a dress that closely resembles a wedding dress, when she is about 12 and he is 22.</p>
<p>11)  Make sure the mother uses the Dr. Spock method of child rearing, allowing the infant child to scream herself to sleep, even if left in the crib for an hour or more. This adds to the attachment disorder. The mother will also only use negative feedback to try to bend the child to her will.</p>
<p>12)  Take her from a family that is mostly left-handed, making her the creative right-brained type, but make her write with the right hand against her natural inclination, by telling her that left-handedness is evil. This has the effect of literally and metaphorically taking the already sensitive subject out of her right mind, as evidenced by studies of stroke victims regarding the left hemisphere controlling the right half of the brain and vice versa. It will also affect her natural brain development, her emotional development, and her creativity.  Please see the following link regarding the left and right hemispheres of the brain: <a href="http://psychology.about.com/od/cognitivepsychology/a/left-brain-right-brain.htm" rel="nofollow">http://psychology.about.com/od/cognitivepsychology/a/left-brain-right-brain.htm</a></p>
<p>13)  Manipulating this subject will be made even easier by sending subliminal messages via RFID implants in each ear (which this author has felt and seen), exposing her to too much TV (to be used in concert with these implants), and virtually no parental supervision. Later, this will have the added benefit of scaring the subject out of talking about it; for fear that she will be further harmed by those interested in keeping this quiet.</p>
<p>14)  It would be assumed that the commonly used ritual drowning at three years old would be used to bring a child to a near-death experience, which serves to make the subject more sensitive than most other children, and it opens the child up to spiritual communication and/or demonic possession.</p>
<p>15)  Use programming (mind control and ritual abuse) to further associate the subject to her initials, connecting her more to her baser instincts, and ensuring she has issues with sex and procreation (of course the overly sexual nature of TV, music and movies will compound this effect). This will effectively subvert her desire to succeed in other areas of her life, and most likely cause her to want to have children before she is ready, resulting in the likelihood of abortion and/or adoption, which adds guilt to her already low self-esteem. An added benefit will be that this will cause her to be too embarrassed to talk about her issues, thus limiting exposure of those in control.</p>
<p>16)  Use parents who have affairs, creating even more confusion for the catholic child who needs her parents to be good role models. A divorce will be likely, with the child being kept with a narcissistic and self-serving, 3-pack a day smoking mother with a gambling habit (The Emperor) who doesn’t have to work, who spends more time with her friends than her own daughter (who will be a latchkey kid after the divorce). The mother will call her stupid all too often, to make up for her own lack of parenting skills, and will tell her that she is never going to amount to anything (in essence these are curses). The daughter will end up with asthma and an addiction to cigarettes (thanks to mom’s smoking three packs a day and having smokers in the house almost everyday since the child was a newborn), as well as an unhealthy ego, no self-esteem, and an inability to adapt to the world around her: fertile ground for what is to come as she gets older. The psychological damage done by her own mom calling her stupid will take her from being in the top 2% of her class to being completely average by the time she graduates.</p>
<p>17)  After the divorce, the adoptive mother will move into a condo and install an overabundance of mirrors (i.e. mirrored bedroom suites, mirrored wallpaper, mirrored switch panels, mirrored closet doors, mirrored coffee table, etc), so that she will become somewhat of a narcissist, making it easy to label her. At 14, her mother will use her to sell hotdogs at construction sites, while wearing a bikini. She will be introduced to an adult male who will date-rape her when she is 16 and still a virgin; an easily accomplished task when one considers this child is lacking a father figure.</p>
<p>18)  By this point, we have a narcissistic rebel with a very unhealthy ego, who will easily end up in some negative music genre, such as punk, which is riddled with angry music. Check in on her periodically, to see if she has certain habits, like cutting herself or twisting her hair into little knots and then ripping them out. If she is doing those things, then the project will most likely be successful.</p>
<p>19)  By the end of her childhood, say, while she is seventeen, the mother will magically lose her wallet with $800 and credit cards in it (keep in mind she has a history of gambling), and she will blame the child for stealing it. She will allow the police to take her daughter down for a confession. The child will be so nervous about the prospect of going to jail that she will flunk a lie detector test, even though she is telling the truth about not doing the crime. The cops will make her give a false confession by saying it’s the only way to stay out of jail, making the child see early on that she has been used as a scapegoat.</p>
<p>20)  Make sure the child has the <strong>illusion of freewill</strong> so that she will internalize all of the blame for her bad behaviors, which are obviously the result of her being the unwitting participant in this mind control program. Let’s face it- we all know this subject was never truly given free will, given the circumstances of her life.</p>
<p>21)  A sensitive (originally left-handed) person, our subject is likely to be an artist. When she goes to college, we can insert into that school, a person with the surname “Skinner” (as in “skin the cat”), who will not only introduce her to a boyfriend to sidetrack her, but later, after having a child they have placed for adoption, this “friend” will introduce her to heroin which will sabotage her career and ruin her life completely. By now, this subject fits a profile, making it much easier for us to keep her down.</p>
<p>22)  After facing the fact that her art career has failed, she will work various jobs, for which she will be grossly undervalued and underpaid. This will cause her to go back to drugs in order to sooth herself away from the sadness and anger she correctly feels for her lot in life, still blaming herself despite the fact that it was never her fault. At this point, she has not made the connection between the person named “Skinner” and her own initials, “C.A.T.”, and its impact on her art career. Meanwhile, she will still work hard for her employers, always being one of the top performers at her jobs.</p>
<p>23)  She will get to a point when, after her daughter is born, she wants to work at home to be closer to her child, wanting to be a better parent to her daughter than what she had experienced in her own life. She’ll get a job on the internet, which will expose her to all sorts of information, confusing for a person who has been in a spiritual crisis her whole life. We can introduce some controlled opposition groups via the internet, to make the subject believe that there are people out there who actually care about the truth. After seeing information on Sumeria and Egypt in relation to Satanism, and while being in a so-called spiritual email group with ulterior motives that discusses many of these same ideas, it will be easy to use mind control to get her to “dedicate her soul to satan”, even though she was actually searching for a higher power. Being in a reversed position for her entire life, and given that she could never truly feel God in the churches or in her own family; it should be easy to do this to someone who was originally such a loving and caring child. Later, she will see the leader of that supposed spiritual group confess online to using “mindbending” and “harvesting human souls”. By this time, you the reader can see how someone who has been metaphorically upside-down all her life might make a dire mistake such as this, extreme as it may sound.</p>
<p>At one point, she will be tortured in her privates during a surgery (it was either right after my daughter was delivered and I was on a heavy sedative, or during a cervical dysplasia procedure). This will destroy her root chakra and cause a condition called &#8220;vulvodynia&#8221; which is delayed pain that results from trauma in the area. The memory of it, since she was under anesthetic, will be repressed, but will lurk in her subconscious mind for years, until it will eventually come out as a flashback (I have flashbacks of what they did to me now, but only a very few people will believe me).</p>
<p>24)  Because she is in her forties at this point, she will begin to have breakthrough memories of how she has been physically, metaphysically, psychically, and spiritually harmed in the past, but no one will believe her when she begins to post her experiences to online email groups that purport to expose conspiracy and espouse truth. She will eventually turn to one or more of those online groups/personalities, hoping for some kind of help; a way out of her nightmare. Unfortunately for her, those she turns to are mostly actors who refuse to acknowledge the sad truth of her situation. They will dismiss her as crazy, while most cannot avoid the facts of her life add up to some sort of mind control.</p>
<p>25)  She will be told that her problems are all her fault, that she must “live life on life’s terms”, but that is akin to “cutting the legs of the sheep and then blaming the sheep for not being able to stand”, as I heard in a Gnostic Media interview a few years back. <strong>“Living life on life’s terms” presupposes an individual has free will, which this subject has never truly had.</strong> How can one be able to “live life on life’s terms” when life’s terms have been so warped for her by others?</p>
<p>26)  When she begins to see how she has been an unwitting participant in this program of creating an artificially induced depressed muse, and when she begins to see how all of her inspiration has been gleaned from her and dolled out to others who are supported by media moguls, the implants can then be used to audibly convince her that she is the responsible party in all of this, which will help drive her into a deeper depression, and will make her think she is schizophrenic. The voices delivered via these implants will at first tell her she is Mary, then Jesus, God, an angel, a demon, and then Satan himself, which reminds this author of a band called <strong>Jesus and the Mary Chain</strong>.</p>
<p>27)  By this point, the victim is beginning to behave strangely. Anyone she is friends with will be made to turn on her so she will not be able to get much help. Her boyfriend and father of her child will repeatedly try to have her locked up, causing her to lose her job and have no way to support herself. The voices will then use this as proof that she is nothing more than a loser. He will then take her daughter away, moving out of their overpriced home, letting it go into foreclosure, and she will be stuck there with no vehicle, no power, and no water.</p>
<p>28)  At this point, pain will be introduced into her pelvic region (described as feeling like electroshocks, complete with swelling and visible contractions), which suspiciously won’t be diagnosed by doctors, so that while she has been clean, she will be forced to go back to using some sort of painkiller to get any relief from the torture, although she tries to remain clean as often and for as long as she can. While in the foreclosed house, in pain, with no power or water, police will be sent, often enough to scare her. They will even go so far as to fly a helicopter with the spotlight pointing directly in the windows of the house for about a half an hour. This will traumatize her even further.</p>
<p>29)  The voices will remind her of her history of being a drug addict and of having sexual issues, making her afraid to come out with the information she now knows to be true. The voices will tell her that she is being set up for some crime she didn’t commit and, due to her history noted above, she won’t be able to trust the authorities. This is the fear put into her to add to what will finally kill her.</p>
<p>30)  Eventually, she will begin to have flashbacks of ritual torture done to her by her mother. Of course, she won’t be able to prove these events, so she will look even more deranged if she tries to speak of it to anyone.</p>
<p>31)  She will beg God for forgiveness, hoping that He sees how she was abused since childhood, how she was involved in a cult (in order to get her to sign the contract with Satan), and how she does not deserve to remain in this hell any longer.</p>
<p>32)  At this point, she will be killed, albeit very slowly. This will be accomplished by luring her with a hero type, who’s voice will be delivered to her via the implants, telling her lies to keep her from coming out about her experiences because she thinks she is going to be rescued. Then other voices will laugh at her, telling her there could be no way this man would ever care for her. Then they will fill her with fear of going to hell and/or jail. They will remind her that she is “no good” and worthless. These things will help to overwhelm her already overloaded system. It is a form of torture. They will blame her for not being able to quit smoking, but then continue to attack her with threats to her life, freedom, and her very soul, making it impossible for her to quit this nervous habit.</p>
<p>33)  She will at some point hear a voice saying that they are going to make a liar out of her. People will even call her a “storyteller”. She will find it near impossible to find real help from anyone. The thought of eternal damnation will drive her mad and adversely affect her health; however, she will still try to maintain a somewhat positive attitude, despite overwhelming odds.</p>
<p>34)  In the end, we will write her a happy ending to her story; one in which she may still die, but she/her soul will go to a better place where her wishes finally do become a reality. By the way, she has told me that her greatest wish is for things to always get better for everyone, for everyone to finally meet and be with their true soul-mate, and for all to find their own real happiness. Perhaps hers will ultimately be a story of redemption, whereby “God has drug her through hell to get her to heaven”, as one friend once told her.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;"> </span></strong></p>
<p>Before she began to uncover what was done to her, my friend was finally becoming a positive person, after so many years of negativity. She had grown tired of all the conspiracy theories found online and was searching for a higher power. The problem was that she had been upside-down and never knew it. It was in her late thirties that she began a search for the God-force, never knowing that she was an <strong>unwitting a sacrifice</strong> for those unknown to her to get away with horrific crimes against her very soul, which they had been doing on a metaphysical level throughout her life, and from a safe distance, by using music, television, and movies, but also by using rituals involving tarot cards and black magic, as mentioned.</p>
<p>Some of the musical artists she cites as having connections to her life include the following (a partial list): Peter Gabriel, Kate Bush (“Experiment IV”, “Waking the Witch”), Tool, A Perfect Circle, Chevelle, Cavo, Pearl Jam, Temple of the Dog, Depeche Mode, Alice in Chains, Smashing Pumpkins, Metallica, The Pixies, Nirvana, Hole, and more recently, TI, Niki Menaj, Eminem, Dr Dre, The Cataracs, Nellie, Snoop Dog, Katy Perry, etc. There is even an acquaintance named Brian Repetto (a friend of the Skinner character and also of her ex-boyfriend), who has a failing record label known as “Screw Music Forever”, which is disturbing given the meaning of the words mu and sic, which we now know can be read (or felt) as “12-as written”.</p>
<p>While I first thought of her as a hypocrite and a loser who just wanted to blame others for her misery, I now realize that, for her entire life, she has been an experiment for some sick minds to enjoy. It is as if her whole life has been “intentionally so written” at her expense, so that others could make their fortunes by gleaning their inspiration from her sorrow. She had been unwittingly tied to the tarot, the bible, language, and occult rituals, all the while living her life in absolute ignorance of the spiritual torture that had been taking place since her birth. Once she became cognizant of these facts, she became a “Targeted Individual” (known as TI’s in the internet community) for all sorts of electronic harassment and gang stalking, as well as directed energy weapons, which have caused her health to go downhill considerably.</p>
<p>One look at the 12<sup>th</sup> card in the major arcana of most tarot decks shows what was done on a metaphysical level which had the effect of torturing this woman’s soul. This card goes by the title, “The Hanged Man”, “The Dying God”, and also “The Hanged Traitor”. On a metaphysical level, this impacts the victims in ways unimaginable to most, and it speaks to the whole idea of how it was “intentionally so written” (or drawn), as noted above. How they can justify doing this to a female, I will never know, but they did, and they profited from it, which makes this the worst kind of evil imaginable, because it caused her sadness, her negativity, and most of her emotional difficulties, resulting in addiction. Insidious because it was not only done to her the very moment she was born and affected her throughout her life, but she then also received all of the blame for not being the success she would have been had these things not happened to her.</p>
<p>To do this to a human being, to artificially induce someone to be abnormal, just so they could glean the resulting dramatic inspiration from her psyche, to be used in music, movies, and television (tell-a-vision) goes well beyond the parameters of what is commonly thought of as criminal behavior, and because it occurs on a metaphysical and metaphoric level, it can only be termed a “meta-crime”. The victim is affected by these art forms, and then affects them in turn, never understanding why she sees her life reflected in the music she hears and the movies and television shows she sees. The victim has no recourse because the proof, while it seems undeniable to me, is seen on such a large scale that most people are unwilling to open their minds enough to see it. If you are not born on a 12/12 birthday and given the initials C.A.T., then it wouldn’t affect you the same way it has affected her. No one believes her because it isn’t easy to see how this could be accomplished. Most people do not think in those terms, so they label her as a loser and a nut case, causing her even more psychological damage.</p>
<p>One example of how this woman didn’t truly have freewill is shown in one of the three Magus cards of the Thoth tarot deck. This peculiar card shows a woman, surrounded by an image of a transparent bear, with the winged disk (found in Sumerian and Egyptian glyphs and seals) in front of her crotch, in the formation of the caduceus, with the two serpents entwining a pole, going to the bottom of the card. The woman looks like a so-called friend of the victim I am discussing, and the image in front of her crotch closely resembles that of a tattoo on my friend’s back. They had gone to art school together, and that this woman was somehow able to steal ideas from her, using them for her own gain. As mentioned above, her initials spell CAT, and the friend’s last name is Skinner; A cruel irony considering the phrase “skin the cat”, the fact that she introduced the subject to heroin as well as the man who would eventually be in on her downfall, and also considering the name “Skinner” in relation to the notions of “operant conditioning”. “The Devil” card in this deck, 15<sup>th</sup> card of the major arcana, shows the devil behind a similar winged disk. Since she saw this deck, she has told me that she felt like she was being “screwed by others in some way”, her whole life. While no one seems to believe her, it looks to be true since her 12/12 birthday is seen repetitively in the bible and in our culture, and her initials are commonly seen in other literature and in language. She fears that this has made her some sort of target, garnering unwanted negative attention, as she hears people and/or spirits blaming her for things that are well beyond her control.</p>
<p>My friend has told me that she was adopted and has the records to prove it. Given what I know about child trafficking, it is very plausible that she is the victim of Ritual Abuse and Mind Control (RA/MC), making her the unwitting participant in what I can only call a “meta-experiment”, causing her to be an unwell person throughout her life. It is those involved in setting her up to be a muse, by the methods shown in the list above, and those who made it so that she was never able to profit from her own ideas, who should be held liable for her problems that would have never occurred had she truly been given free will; a concept that most people take for granted. When I reexamine the list above, it becomes glaringly obvious that this woman never had free will! When one sees all the facts together like that, the truth about what happened to her cannot be denied!</p>
<p>When one looks at the English language, it is easy to see that the word culture contains the word cult within it, and that it also denotes a type of experiment such as what is found in a pitri dish. Other examples of how our language may be negatively affecting us on a subliminal level (some more than others, depending on their names and birthdates) show how often negative root words are found in other words, as shown here: Chill, Bill, Pill, Till, Mill, Spill, which contain “ill”; Cow, Chow, Blow, Pow, Now, Sow, Meow, which contain “ow” in them (in our subject’s case, I can ask, “why does the cat say me-ow?”); Charm, Pharmacy, which contain “harm”, Mark, March, Mars, Martin, Mary, Marion, which contain “mar”. It remains to be seen whether our language was devised to have these effects or if it was simply an unfortunate accident, but this could have disastrous consequences if one has been purposely made extra sensitive, as was our subject, which might’ve been caused at least in part, by her initials spelling CAT. Our language may not affect the general public as it has our subject, due to her name being related to an animal and animals are generally thought of as extra-sensitive. However, I do think that people have been affected by our language.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that, as I type this, this woman is awaiting a 2.5 million dollar award from her mother’s estate from a tobacco lawsuit, money she will probably never see, since she lost her job and her health has declined considerably since she began to learn of her unfortunate situation. This is in large part due to the drain on her occurring on a vibrational level as the energy vampires continue to attack her on the etheric plane by sending her negative thought forms. They threaten her with comments such as, “I hope you like spiders”, and berate her with statements like, “it might help if you knew you were never loved”, and “it puts the lotion in the basket”, a line from the movie <em>Silence of the Lambs</em>.</p>
<p>Her birthday, as tied to the tarot, has caused her to be metaphorically upside-down all her life, while her initials have had the unfortunate effect of relating her to things such as <em>pussy-cat</em>, <em>catty</em>, <em>catastrophe</em>, <em>cataclysm</em>, and so on (she happens to be <em>catholic</em>, by the way). The fact that her upbringing was lacking at best did not help matters any. As an aside, there are these Pokemon called “Mew”, and one called “Mew-Two”, which are both types of cats, which helped her to make the connection between her birthday, initials, and the words “mu” and “sic”.</p>
<p>The question I have here is this: Is there any hope for this person? She has put up with so much loss in her life and it seems that she was made to do things she would have never had done had she truly been given freewill. Her deep connection with that #12 card of the major arcana of the tarot seems to have had its disturbing effects on her whole life, even though she had never seen these cards until much later in life. <strong>By being in this upside-down position, by being associated with the word “music” (as noted above), and by being negatively associated with her initials, she has had a rough way to go, prompting her to, when she felt the most desperate and lost, sign the proverbial “deal with the devil” because she was looking for God in a world where everything looked insane to her.</strong> She now lives in fear for her life, her freedom, and her very soul. There must be some hope for her, as she has suffered more than enough in my opinion.</p>
<p>Another thing to consider is that these implants on her head are palpable. She hears voices and believes that they have been coming through these things throughout her life, on a subliminal level, negatively influencing her decisions. These are the same voices that told her to get the Thoth tarot deck. While it did help her to see how and why life has seemed completely upside-down to her, it also served to manipulate her ego in a negative way. Now that she is conscious of these voices, they seem to constantly attack her, blaming her for things that could not have been her fault, when one considers the numbered list above. In actuality, the more one examines the facts above, the clearer it becomes that this is a “meta-murder”, for lack of a better term. Considering the fact that her own brother said (when he answered his sister’s phone call), “You won’t live”, and the fact that they are due to inherit a 5 million dollar award from a lawsuit in which her deceased mother was involved (which they are to split), and the fact that he is the executor of the estate, attests to the idea that this is indeed a “meta-murder”, and that my friend is the victim.</p>
<p>As an observer to this maligned person’s story, I would like someone to write a happy ending for the muses in our culture; for I am sure there must be more than one. I will begin one, but <strong>I am curious how many people who have benefitted from the muses would be willing to somehow pay them back</strong>. It is something that should be considered in my opinion.</p>
<p>In the end, I choose to write a happy ending for my friend, the muse, and indeed, for all of the muses. Instead of being metaphorically ripped apart, let them be found by love and compassion. Let the muses be granted forgiveness for their bad behaviors and decisions, with the knowledge that they were made to be ultra-sensitive and unconscious in the first place, which is a bad combination. Let the muses receive some sort of justice for what was done to them against their freewill. Relieve them of their pain and suffering, for it has gone on long enough. Let people stop blaming them for not being successful in their own right, knowing that they, the muses, have already given completely of themselves for the benefit of others. Let them be free of any lasting punishment, for it must be known that nothing can be blamed on them. Let her beneficiaries give something back in exchange for all they have gained, as it might very well be in their karmic best interest to do so.</p>
<p>Finally, if a muse has mistaken Satan for God because she has been hanging upside-down, and was taken out of her right mind her whole life, may God forgive her and take her to heaven quickly. Let God forgive her for being confused about the various discrepancies and contradictions in the bible. Let God forgive her for being angry and sad her whole life. She knows that it was men who wrote the bible and not God. She also knows that <strong>history is written by the winners and invariably seems to paint the losers in untrue and unfavorable ways</strong>. Truth shall overcome the evil lies told to discredit those who gave everything of themselves and received nothing in return. The muse shall be rewarded for all that she has given, from which so many have profited. God must see how she has been victimized and let her finally win her heaven in the end. That is the happy ending she deserves after all she has given. God save the Muse and quickly!</p>
