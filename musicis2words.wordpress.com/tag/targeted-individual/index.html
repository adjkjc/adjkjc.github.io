<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8220;People who believe they have been targeted by mind control technologies have often been been met with skepticism or outright disbelief. However, recent revelations concerning very real ongoing scientific research by the government, coupled with technologies under development in the private sector, make it harder than ever to completely dismiss these claims. Reliable information accessible on the Internet suggests that what they think is happening to them may actually be possible, either now or in the near future.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many of us already have devices inside us — from pacemakers and artificial hearts to replacement joints. Now there is technology under development that could affect the mind and body from the outside, in disturbing, even maddening, ways — from putting sounds in people&#8217;s heads to microwaving them from within. The limits of thought and human physiology have been much extended.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are also many documented cases of government abuse of unsuspecting citizens, often in the name of research. Political activists and others who upset the status quo have long known that government surveillance, at least under certain circumstances, is a reality.</p>
<p>&#8220;Against this background, a subculture of individuals claim that sinister devices are being used on them, possibly by the government. If these machines are real, it would be difficult to separate the people who are mentally troubled from those who have been victimized. Few weapons, once developed, have not been abused. Even the &#8220;non-lethal&#8221; ones designed to incapacitate, like tasers, have been used to kill. Mind/body devices sometimes fall under this heading and can change a subject&#8217;s very concept of reality, which can be uneasy at the best of times.&#8221;</p>

<p>(By the way, I misspell perpetrator as “perpetraitor” on purpose, because that is what they are: traitors who are perps)</p>
<p>If you remember a game show called &#8220;The 100,000 Dollar Pyramid&#8221;, the title of this document might give you a tiny laugh.</p>
<p>The target is sick. The target is a loser. The target is a bully (what a joke). The target was born out of wedlock, which makes them a bastard, and God doesn’t care about them anyway. The target is gay. The target is anti-gay. The target is a drug user. The target is a bum. The target is a racist. The target is a child-molester. The target is stupid. The target is a whore. The target is a slut. The target is ugly. The target is evil. The target is the devil, or a demon. The target is an MK Ultra victim, and they don’t want any witnesses. The target is “just a bitch”. The target is a pervert. The target is crazy. The target did bad things to people in the past. The target has a record. The target is a bad parent. The target eats cheesecake (that one’s just me trying to have a sense of humor about all of this). The target knows too much. The target is too old. The target is too young. The target is an embarrassment (to their cult, perhaps).</p>
<p>The accusations levied against the target may or may not be true. Many times, the target was born into this program, set up on purpose to make them look bad, after much trauma, sort of like torturing an animal and blaming the animal for reacting to being psychologically tortured and for fighting back. Often, the target is a victim of mind control, to a greater degree than the general population that is, and is being blamed for things they did as a result of a most wicked form of mind control, using trauma, among other things, and sometimes even implants.</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">WHY NONE OF THESE ARE GOOD ENOUGH EXCUSES FOR WHAT PERPETRAITORS ARE DOING TO TARGETED INDIVIDUALS:</span></b></p>
<p>The perpetraitors possibly do not know the whole truth about the individual they are destroying. They have probably been told half-truths and/or outright lies about the individual whom they are targeting. The target may have been handed off from one group of perps to the next, with each successive group being told only part of the story. Since, in many cases, the target has been a target since birth, through programs such as the Monarch Program or MK Ultra, they have been mind controlled throughout their lives, unbeknownst to them, and possibly unbeknownst to the perp as well.</p>
<p>If you are a nonconsensual human experimentee, like me, then you probably know what I am talking about. Many of you who have read my articles or watched my YouTube videos already know that I found implants in my ears in 2008. That means I have possibly been an experimentee since I was born and kept at a hospital, for the first 6 weeks of my life, in the custody of an adoption agency. This also means that anything I did while under the influence of these implants, which may indeed be cochlear implants, is directly attributable to those who are using these implants to influence my life, since I never consented to the procedure.</p>
<p>Mind Control does not equal consent.</p>
<p>However, according to these perpetraitors, I have already been judged.</p>
<p>Some of you who have been targeted are aware of something called the “Truman Show Effect”. We call it that because, as targets, we see bits and pieces of our life stories displayed in movies, music, and tell-a-vision. This leads me to the conclusion that we, the victims in this horrible and inhumane crime, are like slaves, whereby all of our intellectual property is stolen from us, and others get to profit from our suffering. It is the most disgusting crime that could ever be thought up, since the victim (so far) has no real proof, the perpetraitors have plausible deniability, and the nation denies that slavery even exists.</p>
<p>The scary part is that when I looked back over my life, I have noticed this effect going on to some degree throughout it. One example of this is the fact that when I was very young, maybe about 6 or 7, I had this thought: “What if the world around us, that we see, isn’t actually real? What if it is like some kind of movie, covering our field of vision?” I had no idea about virtual reality back then, and this was how I put the concept into words. Years later, I would see Disney come out with the 365 degree movies at Epcot. Eventually, I would see the concept in movies such as “The Matrix” and “Dark City”. It seems to me that someone<b> </b>or some group has VIP access to the collective consciousness and is able to steal from people who are held down for just such a purpose. Some of you may see how this is done on both physical and metaphysical levels.</p>
<p>Now, it seems, that is what I am seeing in this world. It is a world where we are made to believe that everyone has the same chance in life, but it is hardly the case. It has become a world where our  intellectual property is stolen, and then they sell it back to us in the form of music, movies, and tell-a-vision. What if there is a whole section of the population going through this on some level. One example would be how there are inventors who have become targeted individuals. Another would be how Renee Caisse, who invented ESSIAC Tea, had sold her idea to a pharmaceutical company that shelved it, after promising that they would research and develop her formula. Another would be how Ayn Rand died not too long after she, and the producer of the film “Atlas Shrugged”, had an argument about her wanting artistic rights to make a certain scene the way she wanted. During the argument, the producer said something like, “That’s all right, I’ll just wait until you die and make the movie how I want to”.</p>
<p>This happens all the time, although most people either don’t notice it or don’t want to admit to it. I bet that all these people writing in blogs are being stolen from, in some form or another. “We live in a wheel where everyone steals” is what I heard the band “Bush” say some time ago. I would hope that this form of slavery doesn’t last forever, because I fear it causes major problems in people’s lives, probably on a subliminal level, and they are possibly disturbed by the sense that they are being ripped off, but cannot put their finger on what is really going on. As a result of this subconscious feeling that you are being robbed, you may have emotional issues that end up affecting the way you interact with others. Eventually, this will get used against you, even though it cannot truly be blamed on you.</p>
<p>Would those who perpetrate this horrible crime on victims continue to do so if they were conscious of what we victims have been going through as a result of this legal type of slavery? Any negative karma generated by the slave happens as a direct result of living in reaction to an unknown cause of suffering, and that karma must be reaped by those who benefit from the slave’s misery of being a slave in a society that refuses to admit that slavery even exists. When someone who is not of a privileged class tries to do something that is not a typical vocation for a lower to middle class individual, they often end up becoming overtly targeted, whereas before that point, they probably didn’t notice the targeting was happening.</p>
<p>It seems to be a form of psychic vampirism, whereby the target is a victim, and the perpetraitors are the vampires. The victims are bled dry of their creative inspiration, their resources, and any of their forms of support. The targets are made to look crazy with the evil technologies being used against them, whether through the use of implants (mine are located in my ears), some form of heterodyning, occult magic, negative thought forms, directed energy weapons. I have researched enough to know they have a huge arsenal at their disposal.</p>
<p>I am led to wonder if all targets are set up since birth. Are we told a big lie about how this is the “land of the free and the home of the brave”, and how this country is about, “liberty and justice for all”, while everyone else knows the truth, but aren’t telling? Does everyone know that we are targets who were used since birth by the vampires around us? I have been told that I am a ritual sacrifice, which is why my life looks like someone upstairs was playing a big joke on me.</p>
<p>Numerology does seem to play some kind of a role in the lives of various targeted individuals I have met. Could that be how many of us are picked out at birth, possibly stolen through adoption and sold into these sick programs of covert slavery? I guarantee that if you are a REAL target, you have either the 12 or 11 in your numerology, if not both, and if not, then I bet you might have the letters AN in your name somewhere, especially if combined with a C or CH.</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Here’s what they Ought to say, to be Closer to the Truth of the Situation:</span></b></p>
<p>We traumatize you from birth, and then we blame you for not being perfect. We make you nuts, and then blame you for being that way. We steal from you on so many levels, and then blame you for feeling the need to hold onto things (which we call selfishness). We torture your mind, and then blame you for reacting to it. We steal your intellectual property, and then blame you for feeling disturbed. We ruin your life, and then blame you for not being able to make your way in the world. We turn your whole life upside-down, and then blame you for being negative. We cause you physical and mental problems, but then deny you disability. We program you from birth, and then blame you for not being what you were supposed to be, had we not messed with your head in the first place. (And in my case) We make you spend half your childhood in a house of mirrors, and then blame you for being a narcissist. (Also in my case) We place every importance on your body as a woman, and then blame you for being too focused on your body.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, this is the world of the double bind, designed to cause cognitive dissonance in those who are the designated sacrifices. Problem, Reaction Solution: They cause the problem in you, and then demonize you for your reaction, and the apparent solution is torturing you to death.</p>
<p>I even heard one of them tell me that we are just food to them. Let them reap that karma, all of it, including any karma caused as a result of what the target has most likely been put through since birth.</p>

		<h3 class="result"><a href="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/02/05/judged-in-absentia/" rel="bookmark">Judged In Absentia</a></h3>					<p>After being reminded of a website by fellow WordPress author, lissakr11humanelife, I decided to take another look at it, since it talks about the technical possibilities of this nightmare called “<b>stalking by proxy</b>” or “the program”.</p>
<p>The author of this website (<a href="http://www.dataasylum.com">www.dataasylum.com</a>) talks about how the so-called “targeted individual” has been judged by some unseen entity (or entities), which is why the target is in this sick “<b>program</b>”. What he doesn’t mention is the fact that through other forms of <b>mind control</b>, such as movies, music, television, and the manipulation of language, the targeted individual has been set up in the first place, since birth, in most cases. If you are a <b>targeted individual</b>, you might consider the possibility that you might have always been a <b>nonconsensual human experimentee</b>.</p>
<p>Being railroaded into making a false confession when I was 17 years old, by police officers who were not interested in finding out the truth but were only interested in closing the case quickly, should have clued me in on what kind of a system I am living in, a long time ago. I guess I just didn’t want to believe that, after what I was taught about this country regarding the whole “liberty and justice for all” concept. Sadly, the ideal of true<b> justice</b> has indeed become a <b>simulacrum</b> that I have only been able to find in a clothing line.</p>
<p>I must reiterate the fact that many people, including myself, after looking back over their lives, see how they seem to have been set up in the first place, and that their lives seem to have been <b>orchestrated</b>. In retrospect, I now see how my actions have been merely reactions to a negative set of circumstances, involving <b>trauma</b>, neglect, verbal abuse, physical abuse, within my family as well as from outsiders, such as teachers, doctors, and police officers. In my case, I was living with very little freewill, as I suspect are many people who have grown up under similar circumstances.</p>
<p>On the website referred to above, the author states that the targeted individual is “<b>judged in absentia</b>”, meaning that the target has no way of defending against this nasty procedure, since every negative action in their life is most likely <strong>taken out of context</strong>, by unseen accusers. Given the fact that mind control has been around much longer than anyone seems to realize (for millennia since Pharonic Egyptians were doing it for cryin’ out loud!), it becomes difficult to avoid the possibility that people who are judged as guilty by this weird program, were most likely pushed via mind control into being the person they find themselves currently judged for being.</p>
<p>Most of you who read my work, know that I am a victim of<b> implantation without consent</b>.  You may also know about the various forms of mind control programming without the use of implants, as mentioned above. So I find myself asking this question over and over again: How can anyone blame a puppet for what some unseen puppet master is responsible for?</p>
<p>Okay, so let me state, for the record, that I am not committing any crimes, although I <i>used to be</i> a drug addict. Well, it’s no wonder when you consider the circumstances I grew up in! I was separated from my natural mother at birth and kept in a hospital with no real bonding between me and my adoptive parents for the first 6 weeks of life, had a near drowning at the age of 3, was verbally abused throughout my childhood (unless I was left alone with the TV as my main babysitter), allowed to see movies such as The Omen and The Exorcist at age 7, allowed to play in the woods alone at 6 &amp; 7 years old, had another near drowning at the age of 12, spent half my childhood in a house of mirrors (even the wallpaper, coffee table, switch plates &amp; outlet covers were all mirrored!), made to sell hotdogs at construction sites in a bikini when I was 14, raped at 16 by a 21 year old man, forced into a false confession at 17, and there’s more, but I don’t want to go into it right now. Suffice it to say I had no <b>foundational values</b> instilled in me by my family, and I pretty much espoused my boyfriends’ beliefs, since I had no <b>father figure</b>. It is a miracle that I ended up a nonviolent person. Heck, it is a miracle that I didn’t wind up being a serial killer! Beyond that, it is a miracle that I am no longer a drug addict, considering the fact that I have been in horrible pain for the past 4.5 years.</p>
<p>Yet, I find myself being judged by some unknown force, who is either not considering the above mentioned facts (and much more) of my life, or who already knows it might have been orchestrated in the first place. Either way, I feel like a<b> scapegoat</b> (ironic, considering the placement of my implants).</p>
<p>I know that my whole life has been like a reaction to my circumstances of abuse, neglect, mind control, etc. That means I never truly had freewill. So what does that bode for all of us? Well, one thing is for sure &#8211; it means those of us who have been under mind control, to believe some sort of false reality, cannot be held liable for our reactions to that false reality, in my opinion, anyway.</p>
<p>Peace All.</p>

<p>A Metaphysical View:<br />
<a href="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/01/08/abolish-the-archetypes-restore-freewill" rel="nofollow">https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/01/08/abolish-the-archetypes-restore-freewill</a></p>
<p>I bring this subject up again because it seems that there are a great many people out there who seem to think that the elites (powers that be) need our consent to do certain things, like take away <strong>human rights</strong>. I simply do not agree with this concept because of what I have been through in my life. I have learned that my whole life has been virtually devoid of freewill, meaning, that for the most part, the events, decisions, beliefs, desires, and emotions I have experienced in my life have been a reaction to programming, via tell-a-vision, movies, music, trauma, neglect, verbal abuse, and, yes, implants.</p>
<p>As a member of a group known as <strong>targeted individuals</strong>, also known as <strong>nonconsentual human experimentees</strong>, I am having the same issues as so many others in this section of the population. However, after taking a long hard look at my life, I am seeing that this has been happening my whole life, albeit in a less obvious form&#8230;. or maybe I just wasn&#8217;t aware of it.</p>
<p>In 2008, I found the <strong>RFID</strong> sized implants in my ears, which is, coincedentally, the same year I began to hear <strong>voices</strong>, and the same year I found myself in horrifying <strong>pain </strong>in my privates, which hasn&#8217;t ceased today, but is now combined with all-over iching for no reason, hot spots on various areas of my body (as if someone is holding a lit match up to my skin), heart palpitaions, labored breathing (as if someone is sitting on my chest), burning in my chest and breasts, feeling like the bottoms of my feet are on fire, feeling a rush of adrenaline, making me a nervous wreck, unexplained fear, muscle cramps and twitches. I am simply not myself anymore. So, after making a concerted effort to become a more positive person in my life in 2007, it seems like there was some force out there that simply did not want me to become more positive. It came in and began torturing me in the most inhumane ways, as if in an effort to force me to be negative so that I would attract negative things into my life. I found that people I once trusted, family and friends, began to lie to and about me.Like many targeted individuals, the medical community, police, attorneys, etc., all deny it is happening.</p>
<p>Photos of my implants, which are easily seen by the naked eye, and felt to the touch, and are located about in the place where the external part of a cochlear implant would be (except they go through the cartilage of my ears), is at: <a href="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/01/02/implants-any-questions/" rel="nofollow">https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/01/02/implants-any-questions/</a></p>
<p>At one point, I thought I was schizophrenic, so I saw a psychiatrist, who promptly dispensed schizophrenic medications to me, which, in fact, made the voices much worse. I was also turned down for disability by a judge, despite the fact that I was given schizophrenic medications, which leads me to believe there is something more insidious going on in my case. It seems to me that a disability has been induced with the use o these implants, so that I would be unable to work, yet, the judge denying me disability tells me that they just want me to die and not be able to get any real medical help, a hope which receiving medicare might have afforded me.</p>
<p>Since I was adopted, and held in custody of the Catholic agency for the first 6 weeks of my life, I have to consider the possibility that I was stolen and sold into a <strong>mind control </strong>program, which is why I am being targeted now, because I am a witness to an unethical crime done to a newborn baby. I do not say this lightly. I have done some research and found that the Catholic Church in Spain is responsible for stealing over 300,000 babies from their parents and selling them to adoptive families (<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b016d7hz" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b016d7hz</a> and <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2011/10/spains-stolen-babies-an-ugly-past-on-a-staggering-scale-2/" rel="nofollow">http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2011/10/spains-stolen-babies-an-ugly-past-on-a-staggering-scale-2/</a>), and I have also read of another Catholic adoption scandal in Ireland. Considering the opulence of the Vatican and the Catholic Church in general, it is not a stretch of the imagination that I might have been a victim of <strong>Catholic child-trafficking</strong>.</p>
<p>Regardless of how I arrived into the hands of such merciless individuals, able to put implants into a child&#8217;s head, and use <strong>trauma</strong> (typical drowning at 3y/o), neglect, verbal &amp; emotional abuse, and <strong>mirrors</strong> to mind control me, the fact remains that there are simply way too many factors that parallel accounts from the Springmeier/Wheeler book on mind controlled slaves, for me to ignore them any longer.</p>
<p>That being said, it becomes clearer and clearer, with each passing day, that I am indeed a victim of mind control, repleat with implants, and yet, I am finding it difficult to find any help from the medical community so far. If I could only just remove one of these &#8220;glorified headphones&#8221;, I might find a serial number and be able to track down the manufacturer and who they sold them to. Since I was born at least 15 years after <strong>Dr. Jose Delgado</strong> began his research into <strong>brain stimulation</strong>, and since I know what that man was able to do with this stuff, I now know that I never truly had freewill. <a href="http://www.wireheading.com/delgado/brainchips.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.wireheading.com/delgado/brainchips.pdf</a></p>
<p>What was done to me is the direct removal of my freewill through the use of implants, among other typical mind control tactics.</p>
<p>Yet, I hold out the hope that some how, some way, I will find the help I need and deserve, after everything I have been through in my not-so-long life. I say this even though I have become a target for the worst kind of evil, forcing me out of my job, and ruining my entire life, which now has me in fear for my health, life, freedom, and my very soul. I am living in a world of the double-bind, where those things that are truly absurd, sick, and demented are being perpetrated, and/or tolerated by those around me. One look at my implants, and you would know I am not simply schizophrenic.</p>
<p>Those who implanted these things into my ears, and those who are now utilizing the technology to torment me with voices, are directly responsible for stealing the person I was meant to be away from me, and should be held accountable for their unethical and illegal behavior. <a href="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2012/12/19/this-is-a-bill/" rel="nofollow">https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2012/12/19/this-is-a-bill/</a></p>
<p>Peace, and may every targeted individual find relief from this evil soon.</p>

		<h3 class="result"><a href="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/01/07/occulttechno/" rel="bookmark">Occult &amp; Technological Practices Used on&nbsp;TIs</a></h3>					<p>For those of you who see how there is a bigger, occult picture to the plight of <strong>targeted individuals (TI)</strong>, I ask you to read this with an open mind, and please bear with me, as I know I am repeating a few things I have stated in other posts. This post is about the occult and technological practices used on me and other targeted individuals. I will come out with another post soon, God willing, breaking down this stuff, in a list, in separate groups, under a new heading.</p>
<p>After doing some research, due to my own unfortunate situation of being an <strong>unwitting test subject</strong> with actual implants (that anyone can see &amp; feel), I have discovered that this nation has a history of doing <strong>unethical experiments</strong> on unwitting victims. If you were adopted, this may be the case for you.</p>
<p>From Wikipedia:</p>
<p>&#8220;Many of these tests were performed on children, the sick, and mentally disabled individuals, often under the guise of &#8220;medical treatment&#8221;. In many of the studies, a large portion of the subjects were poor, racial minorities, or prisoners.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_experimentation_in_the_United_States">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_experimentation_in_the_United_States</a></p>
<p>I am struck by the numbers of seemingly intelligent people who deny what has been happening to me, even after I show them the implants in my head. Given the placement of these implants (as shown below), I am saddened by my current situation of being a &#8220;<strong>scapegoat</strong>&#8220;.</p>

<p>After doing some research into adoption scandals, it becomes glaringly obvious that I have been used as an experiment for some very evil, disgusting people, &amp; that I was possibly <strong>stolen</strong> from my mother <strong>at birth</strong>, she being told that I was dead, especially when you consider the fact that I was held in custody of this agency for the first six weeks of my life before being placed into an adoptive family, even though my birthmother was supposedly matched up with my adoptive mother long before I was born.</p>
<p><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2011/10/spains-stolen-babies-an-ugly-past-on-a-staggering-scale-2/">http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2011/10/spains-stolen-babies-an-ugly-past-on-a-staggering-scale-2/</a></p>
<p>Although I have tried to contact the agency I was adopted through, I have not yet received a response. Is it that hard for someone to believe that I might have been stolen from my mother at birth, to be used for this hideous program of implantation with <strong>RFID</strong>s &amp; <strong>mind control</strong>?</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_international_adoption_scandals">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_international_adoption_scandals</a></p>
<p>Considering the fact that the system in place, which allows for these experiments to take place, is and always has been heavily involved in <strong>occult</strong> and evil practices, whereby they seem to like to &#8220;<strong>play God</strong>&#8220;, so to speak, how can I keep my mouth shut?</p>
<p>I am now the unfortunate recipient of voices through these implants, which tell me that I am a <strong>ritual sacrifice</strong>, that I was engineered to <a href="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpthoth.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="221" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2012/09/11/symbolism-mind-control-and-metaphysical-sabotage-in-relation-to-archetypal-transference-and-the-second-commandment-of-the-decalogue/12thtrumpthoth-7/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpthoth.jpg" data-orig-size="184,270" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="12thtrumpthoth" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpthoth.jpg?w=184" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpthoth.jpg?w=184" class="alignright size-full wp-image-221" alt="12th Trump from the Thoth Tarot Deck" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpthoth.jpg?w=540" srcset="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpthoth.jpg 184w, https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpthoth.jpg?w=102 102w" sizes="(max-width: 184px) 100vw, 184px"   /></a>born on <strong>12/12</strong> to be that sacrifice, and tell me exactly how my life was ruined through, not only  through the use of these blasted implants (I am trying not to cuss), not only through the use of mind control via tell-a-vision, movies, and mu-sic, but also through the rampant and uncontrolled use of <strong>symbolism</strong> in <strong>astrology</strong> &amp; <strong>tarot</strong>, which are<strong> archetypes</strong> that infect the <strong>collective consciousness</strong>, &amp; the individual&#8217;s <strong>subconscious</strong>, in the form of <strong>memes</strong>. In my case, as seen in the Crowley-Harris Thoth deck&#8217;s 12th trump, I was not only hanging upsidedown from an Egyptian heiroglyph meaning life, but a serpent is attached to my head. I have heard that <strong>Crowley</strong> was an MI6 agent, and a known satanist. Notice that the figure is also unconscious and has hardly any mouth. Could this have something to do with why so many people ignore me? By the way, many of you who know me, know that <strong>mu</strong>=&#8221;12th letter of the greek alphabet&#8221;, and <strong>sic</strong>=&#8221;as intentionally so written&#8221;. Wouldn&#8217;t a person in this metaphysical position have serious issues? It&#8217;s a miracle I didn&#8217;t end up worse than I am. The upsidedown triangle in the lower right of the card indicates that the victim is female. It seems I have been framed.</p>
<p><a href="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2012/09/11/symbolism-mind-control-and-metaphysical-sabotage-in-relation-to-archetypal-transference-and-the-second-commandment-of-the-decalogue">https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2012/09/11/symbolism-mind-control-and-metaphysical-sabotage-in-relation-to-archetypal-transference-and-the-second-commandment-of-the-decalogue</a></p>
<p>So, I cannot help but feel as if I am being punished for my actions in this life, which were directly affected by all of the things mentioned above, and therefore, I feel the need to defend myself.</p>
<p>I am now the target for all the things that TIs talk about regarding the torture I experience on a daily basis. I get the pinpricks, the itching, the burning, the constant pain, the gang-stalking, street-theater routine, and I have to watch as bits &amp; pieces of my own story get played out in the various forms of media (tell-a-vision, mu-sic, &amp; movies), as do many victims (I have heard one other TI call this the &#8220;Truman Show Effect&#8221;). This is apparently how victims are farmed for the creative inspiration that naturally results from living in a state of severe but unspeakable <strong>oppression</strong>. They&#8217;ve got this down to a science, folks.</p>
<p>Of course, when I try to put videos out about it, I get the <strong>online harassment</strong> from some very cruel and heartless people who cannot possibly think I am crazy when I only posted about my implants and the history of how RFIDs have been used as early as the 1950s, by people like <strong>Dr. Jose Delgado</strong>, which is a well known fact, &amp; quite easy to research. The fact that I posted a video about my RFIDs &amp; not 15 minutes later, was attacked by at least 20 commenters, lets me know that there are indeed, <strong>disinfo agents</strong> out there, just waiting for the chance to earn a few bucks by attacking a target who is speaking the truth. <strong>Discrediting the victim</strong> is a huge part of their wicked, perverted game.</p>
<p>Here is one other example of how a disinfo agent might work. My youtube user name is the same name I have on this site (<strong>musicis2words</strong>). On youtube, not long after I began to make videos, I saw a user with the moniker, &#8220;ignoramusky&#8221;, as in &#8220;ignore-a-mu-ski&#8221;. Is that a joke? Is he getting paid to do that? Must be quite a cushy job. Or how about the job of those who are tasked with the responsibility of surgically mutilating another individual? How are they able to live with themselves, anyway?</p>
<p>I am sadly reminded of the infamous <strong>Stanley Milgram</strong> experiment where people were willing to administer shocks to others, even to the point of causing heart pain, simply because they were told to.</p>

<p>In the end of it all, I am all too aware of how my <strong>freewill was stolen</strong> from me at birth, and on both physical (implants) and metaphysical (archetypes) levels. Since this is no longer deniable, as I am sure my stalkers are well aware, it becomes very difficult for me to live with the day-to-day degrading and humiliating messages coming from stalkers, both online, in person, and via synthetic telepathy through these implants.</p>
<p>The fact remains that, in my head, at each ear, is <strong>damning evidence</strong> against those who willingly put implants in my head to control my thoughts, emotions, and even my behavior; and in the tarot and astrology is damning evidence that there are indeed occultist elites, running the world, who set individuals like me up, to be made to do things against our will, which makes them directly responsible. I believe this is why I am being tortured. I think they want me dead before I can prove, on a larger scale, what was done to me.</p>
<p>All my life, I felt this absence of higher power, or God. When I was a little girl, I loved <strong>God</strong>, and wanted to serve Him. The bible says that God grantd human beings freewill, but I am saying that humans have taken away a large measure of freewill just through the &#8220;<strong>graven images</strong>&#8221; (images that have become <strong>engraven</strong> into the collective consciousness) of the tarot and astrology, among other things. The bible says that God loves the<strong> truth</strong>, but I have found it increasingly difficult to get anyone to see the truth about what was done to me. What in the world is going on here?</p>
<p>Could I be correct in my attributing the <strong>upsidedown</strong> nature of our world today to the fact that we are living in years surrounding 2012, and the <strong>12th trump</strong> of the tarot is an upsidedown figure in most decks (of which there are over 1,000)? Did those who invented the tarot make that card like that on purpose? Getting it in a reading is supposed to mean &#8220;<strong>redemption through sacrifice</strong>&#8220;, and although my life sure has seemed like one big sacrifice, I have yet to find redemption, in the biblical sense of the term. To me this card is a misuse of what is known as &#8220;<strong>the butterfly effect</strong>&#8220;, whereby a repetion of a vibration increases its amplification.</p>
<p>Okay, so I am ranting now, but everything that I have discovered over the past four and a half years have led me to this point. I so desperately want for the real God, the one who loves each and every one of His creations, to see the truth, and to stop letting me be blamed, and to stop letting me be used, abused, and killed in the process. It&#8217;s no wonder that someone in my position would feel this way. I am accused of all sorts of things that are patently false, as well as some things I am responsible for. However, if I was mind controlled my whole entire life, how can I be blamed? I mean, its not just the archetypal memes, the TV, music, or movies, but it is also <strong>mind control via implants</strong>, which is the most insidious form of mind control I can think of.</p>
<p>It was in 2008 that I discovered the implants, and ever since I have heard audible voices, but for how long was someone &#8220;whispering in my ears&#8221; before I became aware of these things? The idea that a person will not do something under hypnosis that they are not willing to do while conscious has been disproven, so it should be obvious that until I became aware of what was happening, I had been living under a state of <strong>post-hypnotic suggstion</strong>.</p>
<p>For many TIs, life seems like a world where you are the butt of a humungous joke that, until now, everyone has been aware of, but you&#8230; and the joke is, suprise, you&#8217;re being sacrificed! What if this was engineered the whole time that the TI has been living? Would the so-called &#8220;<strong>higher self</strong>&#8221; somehow know this, and have serious issues throughout life because of it?</p>
<p>If you are a TI, I ask you to see if you have the 12 in your <strong>numerology</strong>. It may explain much. Many TIs I have met either have the 12 in their numerology, or they are double digit birthdates.</p>
<p>Another commonality is that many female TIs have some form of the name &#8220;Anne&#8221;, either as a first or middle name. Imagine my suprise on a TI forum, when I saw the moderator&#8217;s email was &#8220;anna-advocate&#8221;, but her group name was &#8220;Jo-Jo-Jive&#8221;. I could just be reading into it, but after what I have been through, I am sensitized to this kind of thing. For example, having initials that spell &#8220;cat&#8221; is used to dehumanize me by my stalkers, but when I looked back on my life and remembered how a woman with the last name &#8220;skinner&#8221; was able to steal and use my ideas, being reminded of the phrase &#8220;skin the cat&#8221;, I am again made to feel like my life is a cruel joke.</p>
<p>It is really just <strong>covert slavery</strong>, which is worse than regular slavery, because the enslaver won&#8217;t even admit that it is happening.</p>
<p>May all TIs find relief from this <strong>heinous crime</strong>.</p>

		<h3 class="result"><a href="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2012/12/16/i-am-a-human-being/" rel="bookmark">I Am a Human&nbsp;Being</a></h3>					<p>Sadly, I find myself repeating the statement made by John Merrick, in The Elephant Man: “I am not animal, I am a human being!”</p>
<p>As some of you know, if you’ve read some of my documents about my case as a mind control victim and targeted individual, my initials spell CAT. So I just heard a voice, coming through these glorified headphones (see photos below) implanted in each of my ears, “we are killing off the animals”. So I responded with, which I am sure they expected, “I am not an animal, I am a human being”. They probably got a good laugh at that one.</p>
<p>This is yet another reason why I know I have been a mind control victim. I was named with these initials specifically so I could be dehumanized by my stalkers, who are somehow able to communicate to me through these implants. This shouldn’t be difficult to recognize, if you are aware of Dr. Jose Delgado’s research involving putting a stimoceiver into a bull’s brain to be able to stop it from charging, using a remote control. This research, done during the 50s and 60s, allowed Dr. Delgado to “play animals like instruments”. If this technology was available back then, what is it being used for now? How far has it advanced since Delgado’s work?</p>
<p>I am reminded of a movie made in the 70s, called “The Andromeda Strain”, in which they showed people in this underground army base using a touch screen computer. The screen was on a bulky monitor, yet if you watched, you could see the display actually change, behind the glass, when the operator touched a virtual (graphic) button on that display. This tells me that any new technology has probably been around at least 20 or 30 years before it is released to the public. Most people take this idea about technology for granted anyway, but seeing that movie put it into perspective for me.</p>
<p>I have been in constant pain for over four years now. Most of my pain is unfortunately located in my privates. It feels like I am being electrocuted in my vagina. I hope that doesn’t offend anyone, but I just don’t know how else to say it. The only relief I get is when I am asleep. Coincidentally, the only relief I get from the voices coming through these implants is also when I am sleeping. I have a flashback, involving a procedure I had done to remove cervical dysplasia, during which, I was under a general anesthetic. Four years after the procedure was done, I began to have symptoms of a condition, called vulvodynia, which is often caused by trauma to the area. Two years after the pain started, and six years after the procedure, I had a flashback of a doctor using a very loud instrument on me; my mother was there, I could hear the instrument and my own screams.</p>
<p>Many targeted individuals who have done research on the voices phenomena are aware that the capability exists called “heterodyning” that is used to project voices at a person, which no one else can hear. I get this type of transmission also, but the fact that I have obvious implants in the cartilage of each ear (see photos), and the size of these implants (the exact size of RFID chips), tells me that they may have been used, throughout my life, during my sleep, to program me, and to manipulate my emotions, beliefs, opinions, and who knows what else. Could it be that these implants caused me to be depressed, apathetic, angry, uneasy, and generally negative throughout my life? It wouldn’t be hard to recognize the possibility once one has read about Dr. Delgado’s research.</p>
<p>Below are photos of my implants, which can be plainly seen and felt:</p>

<p>As you can see, the implant is not noticeable, until I lightly pull back on the top part of my ear. I can put my finger into the top part of my ear, behind the implant, and feel the rounded, other end of it, meaning that the implant goes right through the cartilage.<a href="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2012/09/11/symbolism-mind-control-and-metaphysical-sabotage-in-relation-to-archetypal-transference-and-the-second-commandment-of-the-decalogue/leftsideimplant-4/" rel="attachment wp-att-249"><img data-attachment-id="249" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2012/09/11/symbolism-mind-control-and-metaphysical-sabotage-in-relation-to-archetypal-transference-and-the-second-commandment-of-the-decalogue/leftsideimplant-4/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/leftsideimplant.jpg" data-orig-size="150,200" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="LeftSideImplant" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/leftsideimplant.jpg?w=150" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/leftsideimplant.jpg?w=150" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-249" alt="LeftSideImplant" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/leftsideimplant.jpg?w=112&#038;h=150" width="112" height="150" srcset="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/leftsideimplant.jpg?w=112&amp;h=150 112w, https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/leftsideimplant.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 112px) 100vw, 112px" /></a></p>
<p>I am desperate to get at least one of these removed, so I can get a serial number from it and track down who made it, so I can find out who did this to me. I would have a big, fat lawsuit against the organization responsible for putting implants into a baby’s head, if I could just find an honorable attorney and doctor. I am just not sure if honorable professionals in these areas exist anymore, after what I’ve been through over the past few years.</p>
<p>Most brain implants have wires attached to them, allowing deep penetration into the brain, so that various areas can be stimulated, creating various effects. Delgado was able to put previously calm people into rages, and vice-versa. Yet, when I have gone online to talk about the variety of mental, physical, and even metaphysical tortures I have been through, many people like to tell me I am crazy.</p>

<p>I am deeply grateful to those who have offered information to me regarding my situation, like MJ, who sent me a link to a story about a catholic agency, in Spain, responsible for selling 300,000 babies, telling most mothers that their babies died at birth.</p>
<p>I am angry with those who had the capability to do the right thing and investigate, but did nothing, except call me a liar. An example of this is the psychologist who had the nerve to tell me that these things in my ears were just keloids (a type of scar). Well, here is an example of what keloids look like:</p>

<p>Keloids are scars that are raised above the skin. They do not occur on their own, for no reason, in symmetrical locations. People generally do not feel vibrations through them or hear voices through them, regardless of location.</p>
<p>I had one person try to tell me that they were cutaneous horns, which look nothing like what I have on my ears. Cutaneous horns result from a buildup of keratin in an area, usually on the face or ears. I have yet to find a case where they developed in symmetrical locations, and they are above the skin, not under it, like my implants are. Incidentally, when I have searched the term “subcutaneous horns”, what I find are actually cutaneous horns, according to the photos I have found which are the same ones I found when searching the term “cutaneous horns”.</p>
<p>This is a cutaneous horn:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you see the difference?</p>
<p>The fact that medical professionals have been unwilling to help me so far, speaks volumes. The fact that these voices have gotten me labeled as schizophrenic, yet I was denied by a judge for disability, also speaks volumes. Clearly, I was denied for disability because if I was granted disability, I would have healthcare, and I might have been able to get a doctor to look at these things. Once I get a serial number from one of these implants, someone would be exposed for their role in unlawful and unethical experimentation done on an unwitting victim.</p>
<p>Could it be that I was sold, through adoption, to be a part of some sick experiment, involving the use of implants, among other things, including mirrors, neglect, and abuse? It becomes harder and harder for me to deny the possibility.</p>
<p>If you, the reader, know of any honorable attorneys or doctors who might be willing to help me discover the whole truth, I would certainly give you a portion of any settlement or lawsuit award I might receive as a result.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading!</p>
<p>Peace.</p>

<p>My daughter was born, in Oct of 2004, delivered via C-section. The very next month, I and my daughter both had surgeries. She had a surgery for pyloric stenosis, and I had one for cervical dysplasia. Both of us were put under general anesthetic. I have since had flashbacks of something very terrible being done to me in my privates, causing a constant physical pain that came out in Sept of 2008, in the form of <b>vulvodynia, a disease marked by constant vaginal pain and contractions</b>, <b>often caused by previous</b>  <b>trauma</b> in the area. When I describe my symptoms to people, some people believe it is <b>demons</b> doing it to me. That being said, in 2010, I had a memory resurface of the doctor (replete with surgical mask) doing something to my privates with a loud (“whirring sounding”) instrument, during which I could hear my own mother speaking to me, and I could hear my own screams. The fact that I could hear my own screams tells me this is a “<b>flashback</b>”, of a memory of an event that my mind had to repress to keep me sane. The fact that my mother was involved in this procedure, and in my flashback, I can clearly hear her telling me, “what a great hero you’re being for your country”, combined with the fact that my mother is now dead, tells me that they not only did something terrible to me, but that they might have killed her so that she would not be able to be questioned. The procedure was done by my OB/GYN, Romeo Acosta. I have been in constant pain in the area for around four years now. The pain itself is traumatic.</p>
<p>In May of 2008, I discovered implants, located just in front of each ear. I have no idea how long they’ve been there. I had an oral surgery in 1984 under a general anesthetic, and I had an oral surgery in 2001 or 2002 (I’m not sure of the date), under a general anesthetic. Although it could have happened when I was adopted and held by the Catholic agency (that has since been indicted on <b>child-trafficking </b>charges) for about 6 weeks before my family got me, even though they had my birthmother set up with my adoptive mother long before I was born.</p>

<div class="mceTemp"></div>
<p>Considering the fact that I never felt pain in the locations of these implants after any surgery, I am forced to assume that they were put in before I can remember. I now hear voices through them and I have buzzing and painful sensations coming through them. As you can see from this image, they are not visible until I gently pull back on my ear, but they are definitely there. It was maybe a few months before I discovered the implants that I began to hear voices. At first, I heard a voice telling me to “purge”, as if referring to memories that were coming back to me, at that time. I also was made to believe that some of the voices were angels and that one of them was God. These voices communicated all manner of things to me, making me appear schizophrenic, so that I would be easily discredited (but I was suspiciously denied for social security disability despite the fact that I was given schizophrenic meds by the free clinic). The fact that I have these two lumps in my head cast a reasonable doubt on the idea that I may be schizophrenic. Also casting doubt on the schizophrenia diagnosis is the fact that the lithium and other meds I was given actually made the voices get worse.</p>
<p>At the end of August, 2008, I was left in a foreclosed home with no power or water, when my boyfriend left with our daughter. This happened as a result of me hearing voices and following their commands, thus appearing crazy. At that time, the voices coming through the implants, I didn’t yet know about, were telling me that my real family was coming to find me, prompting me to go around looking for them. Well, they lied, but this made me look nuts. In early September of the same year, I found myself in the worst pain I had ever experienced in my life. While in this constant pain, I stayed in that house for about 2.5 years, in the worst heat and, at times, in freezing temperatures. I had no vehicle and had no way of getting around, in order to try to get a job. During that time these voices, coming through the implants, told me that certain people, in my life were causing my pain. This made me send very negative energies at these people. Also during that time, in the worst heat of summer, a police helicopter woke me up at 2:30am, flying in a circular pattern, around that house, shining the spotlight into the windows for over a half an hour, which was traumatizing to say the least. <b>During this helicopter trauma, no police vehicle came to the house, which makes the entire event suspect of someone trying to traumatize me on purpose.</b></p>
<p>While my boyfriend had a decent excuse for leaving, and for trying to have me locked up 3 times, thereby costing me the one job I ever truly loved in my life, his treatment of me during that time was downright cruel at times. For example, when he left, he promised to leave me with one of our two vehicles, but he ended up taking it instead. Also, there was one time, within the year after he had left, and I had no job at that point, and I was alone in pain, unable to walk much, and without a vehicle, trying to work with crystals to heal myself, I had no money and no way to get food. I ended up having to sell some of his tools. He busted in the door and yelled at me. He went to smash my crystals, and I tried to stop him by putting my arms between his hands and my crystals. He then grabbed me by the arms and threw me on the floor. This happened three times, and on the 3<sup>rd</sup> time, I hit the chair first. Then he grabbed my cell phone, ran out the front door, shutting it behind him &amp; held it closed while he called the cops to accuse me of domestic violence. HE LIED, &amp; I’M PRETTY SURE THAT COP KNOWS IT. This man is 6’3” tall and is almost twice my size, in weight and stature combined. There is no way I could ever physically harm or abuse him. I mean, come on now!</p>
<p>Most people are aware that the <b>Catholic Church has been indicted on child-trafficking charges, in connection to satanic ritual abuse</b>. I was adopted through Catholic Charities, which also has some record of being involved in child-trafficking. Many people are aware of the existence of <b>ritual abuse and mind control</b>, especially that which has been uncovered, during the 1977 MK Ultra Senate Hearings, to have occurred in the 50s and 60s, to witting and unwitting victims. In those hearings, it was discovered that many files of these horrendous experiments were destroyed. While it has been stated that these secret programs ended at least 12 years prior to the 1977 hearings, the fact that they were secret in the first place, leads me to believe that other programs continued after the one known as <b>MK Ultra</b> had ended. The experts involved in this and other secret programs were often Nazi scientists brought into our country, under what is known as “<b>Project Paperclip</b>”. Some such “experts” include Joseph Mengele, Ewen Cameron, and Jose Delgado. Many of the Nazi scientists were experts in the <b>occult</b>. Other mind control programs that are documented include: <b>Project Naomi, Project Artichoke, Project Monarch, and Project Delta. </b>A common practice involved in these mind control programs was to use adopted children and children from orphanages. Most experts on mind control know about the use of occult symbolism.</p>
<p>Beyond typical mind control and ritual abuse, involving a <b>drowning at 3y/o</b> (which is common to ritual abuse survivors), I have been unknowingly, unwittingly living under an occult curse my entire life. I only became aware of it within the past four years, when I discovered the Thoth tarot deck and its’ uncanny connection to my life, as noted in the e-books, “<b>Meta Crime</b>”, and “<b>Symbolism, Mind Control, and Metaphysical Sabotage in Relation to Archetypal Transference and the Second Commandment of the Decalogue</b>”. This curse is tied to my birthdate with the 12<sup>th</sup> trump of the tarot, which, in almost every single deck (of which there are over a thousand in print today), is an upside-down figure. In at least three different decks, there is a serpent close to the victim’s head, or attached to it with rays. I have read a document entitled, “Project Monarch – Nazi Mind Control”, on the internet, which states: “One of the earliest writings giving reference to occultism is the <b>Egyptian Book of the Dead</b>, a compilation of rituals explicitly describing methods of torture and intimidation (to create trauma), the use of potions (drugs) and the casting of spells (hypnotism), ultimately resulting in the total enslavement of the initiate. These have been the main ingredients for a part of occultism known as <b>Satanism</b>, throughout the ages.” In the Crowley Thoth deck (Thoth is the Egyptian God mostly associated with magic, writing, science, and judgment of the dead) the serpent either represents Satan himself, or it represents the so-called “<b>serpent class</b>”, who are adepts at the occult. Also in at least three different decks, is an upside-down <b>ankh</b>, which is the Egyptian symbol for life and fertility, a symbol that closely resembles the currently accepted sign of female. For some reason, I was always very attached to the symbol of the Ankh, while never knowing what symbolism meant. The 12<sup>th</sup> trump card is a <b>graven image</b> in the respect that it is an image of suffering and/or death. This curse has made it impossible for me to live a normal life, or have any true freewill, because I have been metaphorically upside-down or reversed throughout my entire life. The reversed nature of the card, and especially of the upside-down ankh in the 12<sup>th</sup> trump of at least three decks of the tarot, has caused that reversed vibration to manifest itself in my life, in the following ways:</p>
<p>1)      I was naturally left handed, but the person teaching me to write made me be right handed, by telling me that left-handedness is evil. I was a small child when this happened, but over time, it had the effect of helping to make me a very negative person.</p>
<p>2)      My mother named me with initials that spelled the word for a specific animal, <b>dehumanizing</b> me. Later, she would tell me, “I don’t know why I named you that, I don’t even like cats”.</p>
<p>3)      My mother constantly put me down, bullied me, called me names, and held other people’s children over her own, comparing me to my cousins, my friends, often telling me that I was no good and that I would “never amount to anything”.</p>
<p>4)      My mother (born on 4/4 which corresponds to the 4<sup>th</sup> trump, the Emperor card) had way too much power to be raising someone in such a prone position, as what is displayed on the 12th trump. This card, backed with some sort of occult intent to make a living sacrifice on a metaphysical level, created an energy of powerlessness. The voices coming through those implants tell me that I am to be a ritual blood sacrifice.</p>
<p>5)      The television (tell-a-vision) was my primary babysitter. I was left alone in my childhood, and was even allowed to play alone in the woods at 6 and 7 years old. Anything could’ve happened back then (including being implanted), since I have memories of going to the woods, memories of playing in the woods, but no memories of coming home. Doesn’t that seem strange to anyone besides me?</p>
<p>6)      My mother smoked 3 packs of cigarettes daily, exposing me, because they did not know the impact of second hand smoke on a baby back then, which addicted me to nicotine at a very early age, and caused me to have asthma.</p>
<p>7)      My brother often enjoyed terrorizing me. One such example I can cite is of him wrapping me up in a blanket and tossing me down the stairs. When I got to the bottom of those stairs, I pushed the blanket off of me, and saw my parents laughing at me.</p>
<p>Regarding other accusations about things I may or may not have done in my lifetime: Anything I am actually guilty of is <b>directly attributable</b> to the <b>occult curse</b> I have been living under throughout my life. However, I have done comparably little evil in this world, when compared to what has been done to me. Considering the fact that I have implants in my head, that are easily provable, there is no telling how long I have been subliminally affected by them, or what the voices coming through them have said to me in my sleep. Yet, I’ve never gone out and killed anyone, and I never will.</p>
<p><b>That being said, the following is a list of accusations and responses to them:</b></p>
<p>1)      I have been accused of not sharing, but if one considers how my whole life was orchestrated and my inspiration was stolen from me via the serpent class, as represented by the snake at the head of the victim in the 12<sup>th</sup> trump of the <b>Thoth</b>, <b>Ludovica</b>, and<b> Hermetic</b> tarot decks, then it would stand to reason that I would have a subconscious need to hold onto things, as a security issue, given that I was subconsciously seeing my own creative ideas being stolen. For example, artistic ideas were stolen from me (C.A.T.) by people like M.J. Skinner (“skin the cat”). That being said, let it be known that when I saw others who were truly in need, even when I was myself living in substandard conditions, I still shared what I had. Please see my document entitled, “<b>Metaphysical Sabotage</b>”.</p>
<p>2)      I have been accused of being a pedophile ….   This is simply ridiculous and doesn’t even deserve a response, but the answer is: NO, I AM NOT A PEDOPHILE, NOR HAVE I EVER KISSED OR DONE ANYTHING REMOTELY SEXUAL WITH ANYONE UNDER AGE,. HOWEVER, I MYSELF WAS DATE-RAPED, WHEN I WAS 16 Y/O, BY A 21 Y/O, AND IT WAS MY VERY FIRST EXPERIENCE OF INTERCOURSE. I NEVER PROSECUTED HIM.</p>
<p>3)      I have been accused of being a racist ….  Never in my life have I ever been racist, nor have I ever discriminated on the basis of anything. In fact, even as a child, I always showed the utmost respect for oppressed races and cultures.</p>
<p>4)      I have been accused of being a baby killer. While I deeply regret having two abortions, I had no parents around raising me, and as a result, I ended up following much of what those around me believed, especially the males, because I sorely lacked a father figure in my life. At one point, I ended up with a boyfriend who as prochoice and exposed me to the book called “Our Bodies Ourselves”, which approved of abortion. Unbeknownst to me, my subconscious was having a strong influence in my life, and had me always seeking out a daddy. In my late teens and early twenties (and even into my 30s), I was easily influenced by every boyfriend I had.</p>
<p>5)      I have been accused of being lazy. Up until I found myself in excruciating pain, I have always taken relatively good care of my home, until I found myself simultaneously working, taking care of a toddler, and trying to keep house from 2005 until 2008.</p>
<p>6)      I have been accused of being a whore, which I am most certainly not. There have been short moments in my life, when I was forced to live like one, like when I was living in the streets, but I am not one, and have not truly ever been one.</p>
<p>7)      I was a latchkey kid from 9y/o until I moved out, even though my mother didn’t have to work during that time, at all.</p>
<p>8)      As previously discussed, I have been living under an occult curse my entire life, as a result of my birthdate in relation to the 12<sup>th</sup> trump of the Thoth tarot, with the upside-down ankh (the Egyptian symbol for life &amp; fertility), with my mother being the 4<sup>th</sup> trump, allowing her way too much power over me.</p>
<p>9)      I have been accused of being a narcissist … I spent half my childhood in a house of mirrors, with a narcissist mother, in which there was a completely mirrored coffee table, the closet doors were mirrored, the bedroom sets were mirrored, and even the wallpaper was mirrored. Can you say PSYOPS? What does growing up in a house of mirrors do to a child anyway? So I probably WAS one, but I am not one now. For info on the role mirrors play in mind control, please see the following: <a href="http://www.theforbiddenknowledge.com/hardtruth/mind_control_art.htm">http://www.theforbiddenknowledge.com/hardtruth/mind_control_art.htm</a></p>
<p>For more info on general mind control programming, including the use of mirrors, see the Fritz Springmeier and Cisco Wheeler document about &#8220;Undetectable Mind Controlled Slaves&#8221;, here: <a href="http://www.emhdf.com/Monarch-mind-control.pdf">http://www.emhdf.com/Monarch-mind-control.pdf</a></p>
<p>10)   I have been accused of being “cruel” …  well, I couldn’t have possibly been as cruel to my child as the catholic church has been to me, by holding me in custody for the first 6 weeks of my life (with no parental bonding), or by allowing some agency to put implants in my head. There was a time, when I was in my late teens or early twenties when this guy named Bob punched me and threw me into a sliding glass door. I retaliated after being goaded by his own friends. I am not proud of what I did. I painted his member red. Even to this day, when I have repented of it to people I know, I was told it was “funny” not “horrible”, and that he deserved it for hitting a woman. However, I sincerely regret it.</p>
<p>11)   If the accusation is in relation to me name calling or being a bully when I was younger… well, my parents were bullies to me (mom called me stupid, while dad called me fat). Growing up, my friends made up names for others, and so did I. “When in Rome, etc.” I think this is where that came from, but I changed. For example, there was a teacher in my school named Emma Mosteller, and my friend, Lucianne, made up the name, “Enima Molester”. I subsequently called my friend “Lusty Anus”. I am not proud of it, but I was following a pattern. Considering the fact that I was metaphorically upside-down, it should come as no surprise.</p>
<p>12)   I have been told that “you snooze you lose”, regarding the fact that, after I lost my job, finding myself in horrible, nightmarish pain, with no vehicle, no place to go, and living in a foreclosed house with no power or water, it took me over three years to begin writing about my experiences in any coherent way. I had virtually no access to a computer, so I was unable to learn much of anything in relation to the curse, or anything else for that matter. When I was able to get to a library, I found many books unavailable. I contend that I was not snoozing, rather, I was cut off from every outlet to state my case for forgiveness, once I began to learn of the metaphysical curse I had been living under throughout my life. Also, I was in a state of constant traumatic pain and hearing voices through these implants, which I sometimes want to call “headphones”. Even friends and neighbors would rarely let me use their computers to get online, so I was unable to post my experiences. When I was able to get online, I was hit with either (at neighbor&#8217;s house) someone talking in my face during the whole time, which distracted me, or (at library) I would be inundated with various voices throwing me off track, or scaring me into leaving with threats. Wherever I went for help regarding my specific problem, I was not able to get adequate treatment, which I sincerely hope will change soon. Whoever is responsible for the ongoing Traumatic Stress Disorder should have to face some consequences for their actions, because its goal seems to be just to make me appear insane, or to actually drive me insane, but it seems like there is some agency that does not truly want me to get help, or recover.</p>
<p>13)   I have been accused of being a liar … Honestly, when I was younger, I did make things up to try to get attention from my parents, because they were simply absent during my childhood, but I did change. In fact, I made the conscious effort to change because I did not like getting attention that way, and I didn&#8217;t want to be a liar. At the risk of being labeled a liar by my accusers/gang-stalkers, I am being honest about my past. At one point, after discovering what was happening to me, I believed that one of my doctors (OB/GYN) might have been named Delgado, but I have since researched my personal files, and realized that neither one of them had that name. <i>This tells me that these verifiable implants have been used to enforce the idea that I had a doctor named Delgado, just so someone could then paint me as a liar</i>. While it is possible I had an oral surgeon by that name, I cannot verify the name of the last oral surgeon I had, who was in St. Petersburg, FL. The first oral surgeon I had was named Castellano, and was in Tampa. Regardless of what doctor put the implants in, and what doctor did the horrifying procedure to my privates, the flashback and the pain are absolutely real. <b>I have no doubt that trauma occurred in my privates to cause it, but of course, no one wants to believe it, or give me a true exam, or even give me pain medication for it. </b>The trauma to my privates has caused the condition noted above called vulvodynia, which is a constant pain in the area, usually caused by a<b> previous trauma to the area</b>.</p>
<p>14)   I have been called a “user” … I honestly do not want to be disabled, not in the least. I have always worked very hard for my money, and in most job I’ve held, I was always the top performer. However, I am suffering from severe PTSD due to the horrible and evil events that happened to me. The obvious implants, that are located in front of each ear, may have subliminally influenced me the whole time they have been in place. For all I know, they may have been sending me subliminal messages during my sleep to make me psychologically unwell.</p>
<p>What was done to me, throughout my life, violated every law imaginable at the time of my adoption. From what I understand, back in the 60s, it was illegal to put implants in a child&#8217;s ears, and mind control was illegal. These days, it seems to be the norm, as I can see and hear it in the music, movies, and television. Since the patriot virtually repealed every human right we had in our constitution, those who wish to subvert human rights seem to have been given carte blanche to do so.</p>
<p>If there is an honorable attorney out there, who recognizes that at the very least, that I should be grandfathered in to being able to sue those responsible for my implants, due to the date of implantation, I would love to hear from one. I have read that one can find the manufacturer of an implant by examining it under a microscope.</p>
<p>I believe I was sold into slavery, to be a part of some horrible macabre experiment, designed to influence me in a subliminal and insidious way, to do things against my true nature and freewill. I hope those who are inflicting this &#8220;soft-kill/no-touch torture&#8221;, as well as that those who put the implants in my ears are someday held liable for their actions, for what they are doing and have done to me is the most heinous crime I could&#8217;ve ever thought possible.</p>
<p>I pray every day that someone can help me. I am living in what I can only describe as a mental concentration camp.</p>
