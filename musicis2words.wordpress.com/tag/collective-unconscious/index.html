<p>Psychiatrist Carl Gustave Jung described the <strong>archetypes</strong> as models of people, behaviors, or personalities that exist in the collective unconscious. <strong>Transference</strong> is the projection of unconscious contents.</p>
<p>It is often said that <strong>a child&#8217;s mind is like a sponge</strong>.</p>
<p>It is my argument that these movies program females into the embodying the negative female stereotypes, such as: being catty, high maintenance princess-types who generally dislike or distrust their mothers. This is all <strong>subconscious</strong>, of course, &amp; most females will not admit to this being an issue.</p>
<p>As you can see, these stories have been around much longer than the Disney films in some form or another. This is how I feel many of these roles became archetypes in the first place. However, Disney in particular, seemed to have some interest in making the adult female role the antihero. Here are some of the Disney Princess movies that contain the archetypes of “princess”, “hero/prince”, and “evil queen”, and where they came from (skip past these, if you are already familiar with the background info):</p>
<p><strong>Rapunzel</strong>, a tale with similarities to a Persian tale from the 10th century AD called “Rudaba”, was published by the Brothers Grimm in 1812, which then became the basis for the Disney movie “Tangled”.<br />
<strong>The Little Mermaid</strong>, published in 1837 by Hans Christian Anderson, became the Disney animated film of the same name in 1989.<br />
<strong>Sleeping Beauty</strong>, taken from an original story called, “The Beauty sleeping in the wood”, by Charles Perrault, published in 1697, was made into the Disney animated film, 1959.<br />
<strong>Snow White</strong>, taken from an original story by the Brothers Grimm, in 1812, but completed in 1857, was made into the animated Disney film in 1937.<br />
<strong>Cinderella</strong>, taken from an original story by Charles Perrault, published in 1697, was later published by the Brothers Grimm in 1812, and made into a Disney animated film in 1950. However, there are earlier versions of this theme, in fables complete with slipper motif, going as far back as the 1st century BCE.</p>
<p><strong>The Set Up:</strong></p>
<p><em>Cinderella</em> was originally a story about unjust oppression with a reward at the end, and is possibly derived from an original Greek tale called <em>Rhodopis</em>, which contains no evil queen or wicked stepmother. The first version I could find with a wicked stepmother in it is a Chinese tale from 860 AD, called <em>Ye Xian</em> (Yeh Shen). The Disney movie Cinderella has the female antihero in its version, as does <em>Snow White</em>, <em>Sleeping Beauty</em>, <em>The Little Mermaid</em>, and <em>Tangled</em> (taken from <em>Rapunzel</em>). It is my opinion that these particular Disney movies actually serve to disempower women in general, although some of them do show assertive princesses. The repetition of the theme of the oppressed princess (daughter role), trapped by some rendition of the evil queen (mother role), but who ultimately gets rescued by a dashing prince (hero/lover role) does a gross disservice to women in general. By creating a set of unnatural archetypes based on roles from these stories, these roles subconsciously become projected onto people by the little girl (or adult woman who grew up with these stories).</p>
<p>Today’s little girl is more prone to the programming behind these movies, since they are inundated with the movies, DVDs, books, video <a href="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/princesscanopybed.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="872" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/02/25/archetypaltransferencedisneyprincessmovies/princesscanopybed/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/princesscanopybed.jpg" data-orig-size="160,143" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="PrincessCanopyBed" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/princesscanopybed.jpg?w=160" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/princesscanopybed.jpg?w=160" class="alignright size-full wp-image-872" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/princesscanopybed.jpg?w=540" alt="PrincessCanopyBed" srcset="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/princesscanopybed.jpg 160w, https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/princesscanopybed.jpg?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 160px) 100vw, 160px"   /></a>games, baby dolls, Barbie dolls, coloring books, figurines, room décor, outfits, etc., which all serve to reinforce the “princess” role in the child’s mind, before she has any defenses against such programming. By being exposed to these movies, over and over again (because of the advent of DVDs), and at such a young age (sometimes from birth), this programming is even harder to resist. It is often said that a child’s mind is like a sponge. Since the programming comes through on a subconscious level, the child’s open mind has no filtering mechanism to avoid being programmed. I would be remiss if I didn’t note that the extent to which a child is programmed by these stories may be directly related to the amount of trauma she has received in early childhood.</p>

In the animal kingdom, baby animals instinctively trust their mother, because the mother usually has an instinct to protect her young. Humans have these instincts as well, but they are subverted by programming inherent in these movies, among other things. By subconsciously identifying with the oppressed princess, the human daughter is subconsciously projecting the role of evil queen onto her mother (or other prominent female caregiver) who then becomes the antihero to the princess. In this way, the mother has become the enemy in her daughter’s eyes, albeit on a subconscious level. It is simple psychology.</p>
<p><strong>Anecdotal Evidence: </strong></p>
<p>I have witnessed this effect in my life, my adoptive mother’s life, and in my daughter’s life. Looking back, I know I projected the evil queen <a href="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/sleepingbeautysavedbyprince.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="876" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/02/25/archetypaltransferencedisneyprincessmovies/sleepingbeautysavedbyprince/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/sleepingbeautysavedbyprince.jpg" data-orig-size="160,119" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="SleepingBeautySavedByPrince" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/sleepingbeautysavedbyprince.jpg?w=160" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/sleepingbeautysavedbyprince.jpg?w=160" class="alignright size-full wp-image-876" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/sleepingbeautysavedbyprince.jpg?w=540" alt="SleepingBeautySavedByPrince" srcset="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/sleepingbeautysavedbyprince.jpg 160w, https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/sleepingbeautysavedbyprince.jpg?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 160px) 100vw, 160px"   /></a>role onto my mother, but did she subconsciously accept that role to a degree? In my mother’s case, she was indeed “rescued” from her family by her so-called “prince”, but it eventually didn’t work out, and they got a divorce, probably because of unrealistic expectations programmed into my mother’s psyche (a Greek word for &#8220;spirit&#8221;). I have to wonder if the woman who unknowingly identifies with the princess role as a child, subconsciously accepts the evil queen role when she enters motherhood, simply because it is the most prominent adult female archetype in movies that programmed her as a child. Could that be part of what happened to my mother (in addition to other forms of archetypal transference), and why I was verbally abused and neglected when I was growing up? My mother was also a narcissist, as are the evil queens/wicked stepmothers in the Disney princess movies, and I spent half of my childhood in a literal “house of mirrors”. Could that have come from the programming from these films? In my daughter’s case, I can see how she has internalized these archetypes, because she certainly acts like a little princess and often treats me as if I were the evil queen. I, however, refuse to accept that role. I love my child and have the natural instinct to protect my child. I projected the Huntsman role from Snow White onto my father, and as such, I put him up on a pedestal, even though he was rarely present in my childhood.</p>
<p>I now have to wonder if the programming from these princess movies is the root cause of why little girls seem to fight their mothers about things that are good for them, such as the way my daughter fights me when I tell her to brush her teeth, eat better foods, do her homework, take a bath, etc. While of course children want to play rather than do homework, would they be more <a href="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/lisahomerpipie.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="866" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/02/25/archetypaltransferencedisneyprincessmovies/lisahomerpipie/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/lisahomerpipie.jpg" data-orig-size="160,115" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="LisaHomerPiPie" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/lisahomerpipie.jpg?w=160" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/lisahomerpipie.jpg?w=160" class="alignright size-full wp-image-866" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/lisahomerpipie.jpg?w=540" alt="LisaHomerPiPie" srcset="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/lisahomerpipie.jpg 160w, https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/lisahomerpipie.jpg?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 160px) 100vw, 160px"   /></a>apt to follow parents’ instructions if they weren’t watching movies and TV shows that make the parents look either like an enemy or unintelligent? In the case of little girls, these princess movies are the biggest suspect, but in the case of little boys, you can simply take a look at television shows such as The Simpsons, which paint the father in a negative light, and make the children out to be smarter than their parents. If you are programmed by these shows to think that you are smarter than your parents, are you going to trust their advice?</p>
<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<p>I have been asked why someone would want to do this. There are a few reasons that I can think of:</p>
<p><a href="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/tangledsexsubliminal.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="856" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/02/25/archetypaltransferencedisneyprincessmovies/tangledsexsubliminal/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/tangledsexsubliminal.jpg" data-orig-size="134,160" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="TangledSexSubliminal" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/tangledsexsubliminal.jpg?w=134" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/tangledsexsubliminal.jpg?w=134" class="size-full wp-image-856 alignleft" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/tangledsexsubliminal.jpg?w=540" alt="TangledSexSubliminal"   /></a>First, you have to <em>follow the money</em>. It is a multimillion (if not billion) dollar industry, aimed at little girls. Princesses are royalty. What do we know about royalty? They have a whole lot of money and stuff. If you can get those children to identify with the princess role, then you can trigger this programming in media, which can then open them up to new programming in your movies, music, television, and advertisements, thereby making them into good little consumers who will buy, or get their parents to buy, anything you make them want. This is done simultaneously with the sexual subliminal messages found in many Disney films, if not all of them, which then brings the child’s subconscious mind to focus on sex (and on baser desires in general), programming which will be played out later, as the child reaches puberty. While the adage “<em>sex sells</em>” is often used in advertising, that is only one reason for <em>sexual subliminals</em>. By focusing children’s subconscious mind on sex, after already setting up the atmosphere of mistrust between parents and children, they will further stray from their parents’ advice, and it will be harder for them to focus on learning, spirituality, or finding a career.</p>
<p>The little girl who subconsciously identified with the “<em>oppressed princess</em>” role will project the “hero/prince” role onto any boyfriends she has as she gets older. However, these males were not programmed by these movies, and thus don’t fit that role very well. In fact, any boyfriend or husband to the female, who subconsciously identified with the princess role, will most likely grow to resent this woman and complain that she is too “<em>high maintenance</em>”. Well, duh, <em>she’s been programmed to be that way</em>! This sets a girl up for a big disappointment that occurs in the unconscious mind when she subconsciously recognizes that her mate can never fulfill the role of “hero/prince”. This will cause a form of cognitive dissonance that the grown woman will not be able to identify, and thus, she will not be able to address or resolve the issue at heart, if she seeks psychological help. The end result of all of this unrealistic programming is depression, among other mental health issues.</p>
<p>If you can get children to mistrust their parents (especially on a subconscious level they cannot recognize), this makes it easier to program them using the media. By the way, this subconscious programming of little children to mistrust their parents is reinforced when they realize the parents have been lying to them about Santa, the Easter Bunny, and the Tooth fairy. Again, this happens on a subconscious level, which makes it all the more insidious and difficult to correct, once the damage has been done. It is easier to program a person who lacks foundational values. This is accomplished as a result of the child being somewhat cut-off from a parent’s protective instinct due to the subconscious lack of trust caused by these movies, as well as certain TV shows. How does one deprogram a child that has had the princess programming reinforced throughout their childhood via the umpteen million Disney princess products on the market (mentioned above)? If a parent tries to raise awareness about the issue to the child, the child is not going to admit that they identify with the Disney princess, or Bart or Lisa Simpson for that matter, because it is not in the conscious mind.<strong> The fact that it is done on a subconscious level is what makes it work so well. People quickly deny it is real precisely because they are unconscious of it.</strong></p>
<p>With these programs in the subconscious mind, triggers can be used to bring this<em> programming</em> to bear in multiple ways. Take the shopping addict for example. Could that be a subconscious reaction to princess programming? How about addiction in general? What about hoarding? Overeating or eating disorders? I already mentioned depression. These mental health issues support an industry already in place: Psychiatric medicine, i.e. pharmaceutical drugs. I feel that many disorders that people suffer are caused by programming, to keep a whole industry running, thereby making a small portion of the population very wealthy from other people’s suffering, without actually curing anything. The only real way to cure some of these issues, in my opinion, is with deprogramming. Most psychiatrists and psychologists out there barely even admit programming exists, much less want to cure it. One begins to see a vicious cycle going on with all of this.</p>
<p>Is it any wonder that Hitler is said to have had a Mickey Mouse figurine on his desk?<a href="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/priestwitherection.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="863" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/02/25/archetypaltransferencedisneyprincessmovies/priestwitherection/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/priestwitherection.jpg" data-orig-size="160,103" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="PriestWithErection" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/priestwitherection.jpg?w=160" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/priestwitherection.jpg?w=160" class="alignright size-full wp-image-863" style="width:184px;height:136px;" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/priestwitherection.jpg?w=540" alt="PriestWithErection" srcset="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/priestwitherection.jpg 160w, https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/priestwitherection.jpg?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 160px) 100vw, 160px"   /></a></p>
<p>So, if you are a mother with a young daughter, and if you decide to expose your little girl to these movies, I ask you to offer parental guidance with these princess movies. I feel that any movie showing a priest getting an erection during a wedding should not be rated G. I don’t buy the story that it is actually the priest’s knees because the erection scene is one lump, not two. Once that initial subconscious separation between mother and daughter is made, then the little girl is directed to follow her <strong>over-sexualized Disney role models</strong>, such as Brittny Spears &amp; Miley Cyrus.</p>
<p>Of course, the extent to which all mind control works on the psyche is dependent on variables in the individual subject&#8217;s life, like how much early childhood trauma they might have had, or whether their parents made any effort to instill values into them, for two examples.</p>

<p>If you are familiar with concepts such as: “<b>the butterfly effect</b>”, from “<b>chaos theory</b>”, and “<b>the law of attraction</b>”, and/or you understand the ideas behind <a href="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/chaostheory.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="753" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/01/28/mcusingarchetypaltransference/chaostheory/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/chaostheory.jpg" data-orig-size="160,89" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="chaostheory" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/chaostheory.jpg?w=160" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/chaostheory.jpg?w=160" class="size-full wp-image-753 alignright" alt="chaostheory" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/chaostheory.jpg?w=540" srcset="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/chaostheory.jpg 160w, https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/chaostheory.jpg?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 160px) 100vw, 160px"   /></a>movies such as “<b>The Secret</b>”, and “<b>What the Bleep Do We Know</b>?” (which talks a bit about <b>Quantum Mechanics</b>), then I feel you may have a better understanding of how I came to the following theory, which is based on my observations, research, and personal experience. While there are many different forms of mind control programming, including, but not limited to, movies, music, tell-a-vision, the use of implants, and even the manipulation of language (which I have discussed in another document), this paper will focus on the astrological and tarot archetypes and their impact on the human <b>psyche</b>. Keep in mind that the word “psyche” comes from a Greek word for “spirit”, thus mind control does indeed affect the spirit.</p>
<p>In this document, I refer to a concept known as <b>archetypal transference </b>as a form of metaphysical programming because it seems to act on a metaphysical level, as opposed to programming through movies and such, which occur on a physical level, although both forms of programming ultimately affect the psyche. Psychiatrist Carl Gustave Jung described archetypes as “models of people, behaviors or personalities” that exist “in the collective unconscious” (1). Transference is the projection of unconscious contents. I am using the term, “archetypal transference”, to refer to the process by which tarot and astrological archetypes are inserted into the collective unconscious, and are then projected onto people based on their numerology and birthdates. Jung referred to cultural archetypes that I see as natural (hero, lover, caregiver , etc.), whereas I am referring to archetypes that I see as unnatural and imposed on people based on their birthdates, and on the collective unconscious through the so-called “disciplines” of tarot and astrology, and their overuse in popular culture.</p>
<p>For those of you who are not familiar with these concepts, there are some references and definitions with links (for further research), at the bottom of this paper. However, I ask you to please read through this document before following the links and getting lost on the internet. 🙂</p>
<p>There is a set of <b>archetypes</b>, in<b> tarot</b> and <b>astrology</b>, which seem to be a type of <b>metaphysical mind control</b>. It is done on a level that is less detectable than the more commonly known forms of mind control, since these particular archetypes have been around for centuries, in the case of tarot (1), and for millennia, in the case of astrology (2). While these archetypes may be hard for some to recognize, regarding how they relate to the “butterfly effect”, please bear with me. These archetypes refer to the “butterfly effect” in that they are initial conditions existing in the collective unconscious that have specific results. Since they have been around for so long, much longer than you or I have been alive, they have become <strong>memes</strong>. One begins to wonder if these archetypes were made to illustrate an existing pattern, if they were made to influence people’s natures  in an unnatural way, or if it’s a little of both. Even if they were created innocently (without a negative intent), I still do feel they have an impact on the collective psyche of humanity, with regards to <b>freewill</b>.</p>
<p><b>My Theory is based on Research, Observation, and Personal Experience:</b></p>
<p>The way “law of attraction” is supposed to work is that, focusing on or repeating a certain idea or desire will bring that idea or desire to fruition. The “butterfly effect” refers to the idea that something seemingly small can have a big impact on something else, for example, that a butterfly flapping its wings in Japan could cause a hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean. Both of these theories, which seem to have some validity, combine to make a big mess where the archetypes of <b>tarot</b> and <b>astrology</b> are concerned. These <b>archetypes</b> are assigned to people based on their birthdates, and also sometimes based on numerology, and thus become the “initial conditions” referred to in the “butterfly effect” (see definition below). There are over 1,200 decks of tarot cards in circulation today (3), and they have been printed and reprinted an untold number of times, which, according to the law of attraction, amplifies the vibration of those archetypes. In the meantime, more and more people have been studying these two disciplines in the past 50 years especially, and/or have been getting readings done for them by other people. As more people are exposed to these archetypes, the <b>collective unconscious</b> is increasingly affected by them, in the form of <b>memes</b>. It is the repetition of a pattern that amplifies its vibration, and produces results specific to that pattern. With all these decks out there, and all their subsequent printings, these energies are amplified.</p>
<p>The only way to bring any true freewill back into this world is to abolish the archetypes. I do not say this lightly. By tying someone’s birthdate to the astrology signs and tarot correspondences, freewill is severely restricted, causing people to <i>generally</i> behave in predetermined ways, based on these archetypes. So with astrology, we end up with scorpios being passionate, but also kind of mean, virgos being intelligent and analytical, but sometimes over-critical, aries being assertive, but sometimes pushy, and leos being glamorous, hogs for attention.</p>
<p>The fact that most people in our society seem to fit most of the main character traits for their star signs, whether they believe in astrology or not, shows that these archetypes have been inserted into the collective unconscious, in the form of memes, via archetypal transference, and unbeknownst to the individual. This removes a measure of freewill, causing people to be stuck in cookie cutter personality traits and life patterns.  Astrology has been around for millennia, and has had its impact accordingly. The tarot has only been around for centuries, but has become so popular in recent decades, that it seems to have caused the collective unconscious to become infected with these memes, which are a whole different set of predetermined archetypes. This then further restricts freewill, again based on one’s birthdate.</p>

For example, my mother was born on 4/4, her corresponding trump card was the Emperor, and she displayed the characteristics of the 4<sup>th</sup> trump, most notably from the so-called, Crowley-Thoth deck. The symbols in that card represented the main characters in her life, one example being the two rams behind the seated figure, representing two aries who supported my mother during her life, my father on the left, and maternal grandmother (deceased) on the right. Aliester Crowley was a known Satanist, who is said to have also been an MI6 agent. Frieda Harris painted the deck under his instruction. Did he have an ulterior motive for this deck? Was he putting this energy out there on purpose to affect reality? When I saw this card, in relation to my mother’s 4/4 birthdate, and recognized the significance of that card’s symbols in her life, I began to wonder if my own life was influenced in a similar way, given my double digit birthdate.</p>
<p>Once I began to examine my own life in relation to the tarot, based on my having a 12/12 birthdate, I could not deny that the 12th trump archetype of <a href="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpthoth.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-221" style="width:125px;height:179px;" alt="12th Trump from the Thoth Tarot Deck" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpthoth.jpg?w=540" srcset="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpthoth.jpg 184w, https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpthoth.jpg?w=102 102w" sizes="(max-width: 184px) 100vw, 184px"   /></a>The Hanged Man, which is an upside-down/reversed figure, had a very significant impact on my development, <i>long before I ever knew the tarot or astrology even existed</i>. Also, please notice how there is an upside-down <b>ankh </b>in this card, which is the Egyptian hieroglyph for “life”. What might that imply? Given the idea of the butterfly effect of these cards being printed over and over again, what might that upside-down ankh ultimately influence in these years surrounding 2012, since it is on the 12<sup>th</sup> trump card? How would it influence the life of a human being, who is unknowingly tied to that card? Could these things have anything to do with how absurd things seem in our world lately with the gross violations of human rights that continues to be perpetrated on <b>nonconsensual human experimentees</b>, and on those who call themselves “<b>targeted individuals</b>”? Could the upside-down and reversed nature of this card have had anything to do with certain unjust things happening in our world today, such as the couple getting arrested for rescuing a baby deer (4)?</p>

So, not wanting to be evil, I endeavored to learn how to write with the right hand. Given the whole left-brain, right-brain concept, which possibly evolved from studies of stroke victims, showing that stroke in the right hemisphere of the brain affects something on the left side of the body, and vice a versa (but I digress), I contend that changing a human being’s natural handedness changes the natural balance in the child’s brain, further subverting freewill. I know of one person, who was born on 10/20 (which carries the 12 vibration &#8211; 1020), who was also made to write right-handed even though he was originally left-inclined. Is that a coincidence?</p>
<p>Both he and I are very creative people, (I was an artist and he a musician), yet we both lack the perseverance to be able to complete creative projects. If we had been allowed to be left-handed, would we have been more successful in our creative endeavors? It is a subject I would like to see investigated. Perhaps someone should do some studies on these people who were naturally left-handed, but made to be right-handed. Maybe one of those illustrious scientists could try that instead of experimenting with brain stimulation using implants which has messed up so many people’s lives, including my own.</p>
<p>This “reverse-curse”, brings us back to the concepts of the “butterfly effect” and “law of attraction”. Causing a “butterfly effect”, the repetition of these archetypes through multiple printings of over 1200 decks, creates a metaphysical effect on the <b>psyche</b>, which in turn, causes a person to emulate these archetypes in some capacity, thereby attracting attributes of their corresponding archetypes. In my case, astrologically, my archetype is Sagittarius, but also Ophiuchus, whose feet do lie on the ecliptic. Now take a look at the 12<sup>th</sup> trump of the Crowley-Harris Thoth deck and compare it to Ophiuchus. Notice any similarities?</p>

<p>In both cases, there is a <b>serpent</b>. It either represents the so-called “<b>serpent class</b>” or the devil himself. In the 12<sup>th</sup> trump, the serpent looks as if it is sucking from the brain of the subject, in the constellation of Ophiuchus, it seems that the subject is <a href="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/deadsnake.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="758" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/01/28/mcusingarchetypaltransference/deadsnake/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/deadsnake.jpg" data-orig-size="259,194" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="deadsnake" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/deadsnake.jpg?w=259" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/deadsnake.jpg?w=259" class="size-full wp-image-758 alignright" alt="deadsnake" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/deadsnake.jpg?w=540" srcset="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/deadsnake.jpg 259w, https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/deadsnake.jpg?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 259px) 100vw, 259px"   /></a>carrying the serpent.  Either way, I see the serpent in these archetypes as a <b>parasite</b>. Hence the background image currently on my YouTube page (shown to the right). I apologize if it looks gross, and I am not an animal killer. I actually really love animals in general. In fact, I feel bad for the snake in that picture. I was just looking for an image that represented how I feel about what has been going on for far too long, in my opinion. While we’re on the subject, why is one of the symbols for America the serpent (as in “Don’t tread on me”)? Could this have been done just to conflict with the Bible, and to cause unconscious confusion and/or <strong>cognitive dissonance </strong>among Americans who happen to be Christian? Hmmm….</p>
<p>Who created these archetypes, anyway? I suspect it was someone <b>playing God</b>. Even the word “archetype” contains “arch” in it, which would be above the head. I see these particular archetypes, which are associated with birthdates, as “<b>graven images</b>” (one could say they have been engraven into the collective unconscious). They have infected the collective unconscious, and have robbed a large measure of freewill from the individual, but have also, therefore robbed that individual of the person they were originally intended to be. Without the existence of these pre-fabricated, pre-appointed, archetypal molds that were put into place centuries and even millennia, before the individual was born, the child who was originally left-handed might have remained left-handed, and the effect on her or his life would have been what the Creator originally intended by making them left-handed in the first place. If you don’t believe in a Creator, then consider that nature also intended for those left-handed children to be left-handed for a reason.</p>
<p>When I take a look at my entire life, I can’t help but wonder if my archetype is an arche-“typo”. I wonder if it is a mistake or if it was done on purpose. It’s a cruel joke, to say the least. Please also consider watching my video about “<b>Symbolism in Words and Numbers</b>” to see more detail about mind control programming, done on such a foundational level. After learning about symbolism, it becomes more obvious that there is a malevolent modus operandi found within the nature of the English language.</p>

<p>Here is an example of an archetype not specific to tarot or astrology, although it is the 11<sup>th</sup> trump in certain, more traditional tarot decks: It is the archetype of justice. Frequently, justice is referred to as being blind. Why is that? Some people say it means that justice is impartial. Well, why not just say “justice is impartial”? Since I have heard and read that phrase, “justice is blind”, often throughout my life, I wonder who came up with that idea. Even most statues depicting this archetype are of a blindfolded woman holding the scales of justice. Justice should never be blind, in my opinion. Rather, it should be able to see all aspects of a situation before rendering judgment on an individual affected by these things. If you are a victim of monarch programming, or a nonconsensual human experimentee, like myself, then you may have noticed that it has been hard to get justice for your situation. If you’re not, you may instead have noticed how the laws in the United States (with the Patriot Act, for example) are changing in ways that seem to remove the original intent of the <b>Constitution</b>, and go directly against the Pledge of Allegiance, wh<a href="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/justiceblind.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="755" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/01/28/mcusingarchetypaltransference/justiceblind/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/justiceblind.jpg" data-orig-size="106,160" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="justiceblind" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/justiceblind.jpg?w=106" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/justiceblind.jpg?w=106" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-755" alt="justiceblind" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/justiceblind.jpg?w=540"   /></a>ich claims the United States of America is “one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all”.</p>
<p>Could this be a “butterfly effect” of the frequently repeated phrase, “<b>Justice is blind</b>”? I think it’s possible. Does the archetype of “blind justice” actually serve the human population? I don’t think it does. Rather, I think “blind justice” serves the criminals who have purposefully enslaved the human population through mind control programming, not only in movies, music, and tell-a-vision, but also through the manipulation of language and archetypes.</p>
<p>Programming via TV, movies, music, and language is done to people on a physical level, meaning that it creates effects on the human mind. However, the creation of these particular archetypes, I feel, was specifically to control people on a more metaphysical level, meaning it has effects on the human spirit, making it less detectable, and therefore more insidious, than those other forms of mind control. Basically, it is what I would call, “<b>archetypal determinism</b>”, done through the projection of specific archetypes assigned by birthdate and numerology, using “the butterfly effect” of over a thousand decks, and untold printings of each, which severely restricts freewill, on an unconscious and psychological level. The “puppet” then, cannot be held responsible for the actions of some unseen “puppet master” who creates and perpetuates these archetypes. That would be akin to “blaming the victim”, a mentality that seems to be occurring on a grand scale these days. The amplification of the vibrations of these archetypes through numerous printings of so many decks becomes nothing but another form of unseen slavery, making human beings into nothing more than metaphysical guinea pigs.</p>
<p>Ah, but we are told that slavery is illegal and doesn’t exist, right? You who are nonconsensual human experimentees might realize that idea as untrue. However, when you try to mention it, you are told you’re crazy. This is known as the <b>double-bind</b> and causes conflict in the psyche, including the manifestation of schizophrenic symptoms.</p>
<p>I would like to give special thanks to Michael Gaio for his article entitled, “Archetypal Semiotic Transference”, because it helped me to see how this stuff works, how it affected me before I ever knew the tarot and astrology existed, and how it affected my mother as well.

<p><b>Chaos theory</b> is the study of nonlinear dynamics, in which <i>seemingly random</i> events are actually predictable from simple deterministic equations.</p>
<p>-From <a href="http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/chaos-theory">http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/chaos-theory</a></p>
<p>Chaos theory studies the behavior of dynamical systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditions, an effect which is popularly referred to as the butterfly effect. Small differences in initial conditions (such as those due to rounding errors in numerical computation) yield widely diverging outcomes for such dynamical systems, rendering long-term prediction impossible in general.[1] This happens even though these systems are deterministic, meaning that their future behavior is fully determined by their initial conditions, with no random elements involved.[2] In other words, the deterministic nature of these systems does not make them predictable.</p>
<p>–From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory</a></p>
<p><b>The Butterfly Effect</b> is first described by Lorenz at the December 1972 meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Washington, D.C., vividly illustrates the essential idea of chaos theory. In a 1963 paper for the New York Academy of Sciences, Lorenz had quoted an unnamed meteorologist&#8217;s assertion that, if chaos theory were true, a single flap of a single seagull&#8217;s wings would be enough to change the course of all future weather systems on the earth.</p>

<p><b>The Law of Attraction</b> refers to the idea that you attract that which you focus on. The movies, “The Secret”, and “What the Bleep Do We Know”, both refer to the Law of Attraction, although “What the Bleep Do We Know” digs more deeply into ideas of Quantum Physics as they relate to the “law of attraction”. See <a href="http://www.abraham-hicks.com/">http://www.abraham-hicks.com/</a> for more information on this concept.</p>

<p><b>Memes</b> The word meme is a shortening (modeled on gene) of mimeme (from Ancient Greek μίμημα Greek pronunciation: [míːmɛːma] mīmēma, &#8220;imitated thing&#8221;, from μιμεῖσθαι mimeisthai, &#8220;to imitate&#8221;, from μῖμος mimos &#8220;mime&#8221;) and it was coined by the British evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins in The Selfish Gene (1976) as a concept for discussion of evolutionary principles in explaining the spread of ideas and cultural phenomena. Examples of memes given in the book included melodies, catch-phrases, fashion and the technology of building arches.</p>

<p><b>Archetype: </b> 1. An original model or type after which other similar things are patterned; a prototype: &#8220;&#8216;Frankenstein&#8217; . . . &#8216;Dracula&#8217; . . . &#8216;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&#8217; . . . the archetypes that have influenced all subsequent horror stories&#8221; (New York Times).</p>
<p>2. An ideal example of a type; quintessence: an archetype of the successful entrepreneur.</p>

<p><b>Transference</b> is the projection of unconscious contents. Jung&#8217;s Studies in Word Association (1906) provided evidence for and referred to Freud&#8217;s concept of transference, published the previous year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     -From <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/transference-counter-transference-analytical-psychology">http://www.answers.com/topic/transference-counter-transference-analytical-psychology</a></p>
<p><b>Collective Consciousness</b> was a term coined by the French sociologist Émile Durkheim (1858–1917) to refer to the shared beliefs and moral attitudes which operate as a unifying force within society.[1]</p>
<p>-From <a href="http://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/collective+unconscious">http://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/collective+unconscious</a></p>
<p><b>Collective Unconscious</b> is a term of analytical psychology, coined by Carl Jung. It is proposed to be a part of the unconscious mind, expressed in humanity and all life forms with nervous systems, and describes how the structure of the psyche autonomously organizes experience. Jung distinguished the collective unconscious from the personal unconscious, in that the personal unconscious is a personal reservoir of experience unique to each individual, while the collective unconscious collects and organizes those personal experiences in a similar way with each member of a particular species.</p>
<p>For Jung, “My thesis then, is as follows: in addition to our immediate consciousness, which is of a thoroughly personal nature and which we believe to be the only empirical psyche (even if we tack on the personal unconscious as an appendix), there exists a second psychic system of a collective, universal, and impersonal nature which is identical in all individuals. This collective unconscious does not develop individually but is inherited. It consists of pre-existent forms, the archetypes, which can only become conscious secondarily and which give definite form to certain psychic contents.&#8221;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              -From <a href="http://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/Collective+consciousness">http://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/Collective+consciousness</a></p>
<p><b>Cognitive Dissonance</b> is a psychological phenomenon which refers to the discomfort felt at a discrepancy between what you already know or believe, and new information or interpretation. It therefore occurs when there is a need to accommodate new ideas, and it may be necessary for it to develop so that we become &#8220;open&#8221; to them. Neighbour (1992) makes the generation of appropriate dissonance into a major feature of tutorial (and other) teaching: he shows how to drive this kind of intellectual wedge between learners&#8217; current beliefs and &#8220;reality&#8221;.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      -From <a href="http://www.learningandteaching.info/learning/dissonance.htm">http://www.learningandteaching.info/learning/dissonance.htm</a></p>
<p>Two cognitions are said to be dissonant if one cognition follows from the opposite of another. What happens to people when they discover dissonant cognitions? The answer to this question forms the basic postulate of Festinger¹s theory. A person who has dissonant or discrepant cognitions is said to be in a state of psychological dissonance, which is experienced as unpleasant psychological tension. This tension state has drivelike properties that are much like those of hunger and thirst. When a person has been deprived of food for several hours, he/she experiences unpleasant tension and is driven to reduce the unpleasant tension state that results. Reducing the psychological sate of dissonance is not as simple as eating or drinking however.</p>
<p>To understand the alternatives open to an individual in a state of dissonance, we must first understand the factors that affect the magnitude of dissonance arousal. First, in its simplest form, dissonance increases as the degree of discrepancy among cognitions increases. Second, dissonance increases as the number of discrepant cognitions increases. Third, dissonance is inversely proportional to the number of consonant cognitions held by an individual. Fourth, the relative weights given to the consonant and dissonant cognitions may be adjusted by their importance in the mind of the individual.</p>
<p>-From <a href="http://www.ithaca.edu/faculty/stephens/cdback.html">http://www.ithaca.edu/faculty/stephens/cdback.html</a></p>
<p>Cognitive dissonance refers to a situation involving conflicting attitudes, beliefs or behaviors. This produces a feeling of discomfort leading to an alteration in one of the attitudes, beliefs or behaviors to reduce the discomfort and restore balance etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     -From <a href="http://www.simplypsychology.org/cognitive-dissonance.html">http://www.simplypsychology.org/cognitive-dissonance.html</a></p>
<p>I contend that cognitive dissonance can occur on both conscious and unconscious levels.</p>
<p><b>Double-bind:</b> Bateson et al. suggest that a person caught in a &#8220;double bind&#8221; &#8212; a situation in which no matter what a person does, he &#8220;can&#8217;t win&#8221; &#8212; may develop schizophrenic symptoms. In the double bind there are two conflicting levels of communication and an injunction against commenting on the conflict. –From <a href="http://laingsociety.org/cetera/pguillaume.htm">http://laingsociety.org/cetera/pguillaume.htm</a></p>

<p>After everything I have been through in relation to being mind controlled &amp; implanted without my consent, everything I have read about the subject of mind control &amp; ritual abuse, and everything I have read in relation to the so-called &#8220;<strong>Law of Attraction</strong>&#8220;, it occurs to me that those in power who are using mind control against others are doing it with a specific purpose in mind: to get those who are what they call &#8220;expendable&#8221; (the <strong>victims</strong>) to create negative karma and to attract negative things to themselves, so they (the <strong>perpetrators</strong>) can attract more positive things to themselves, their reasoning being that they need to keep a balance in nature. The only way those in power can have more, in their minds, is to take it away from someone else. It is in this way, that they believe they are in balance, and therefore justify their most heinous actions against those against whom they wage war, as well as all those who now find themselves in the unfortunate position of being <strong>nonconsensual human experimentees</strong>, or TIs (<strong>Targeted Individuals</strong>).</p>
<p>It is my contention that this is their way of cheating the &#8220;<strong>game of life</strong>&#8220;. By forcing someone who was originally a very positive and loving child into being a negative teen &amp; adult, they are <strong>circumventing</strong> the <strong>freewill</strong> of an individual. They use the occult to do this, using <strong>astrological</strong> and <strong>tarot <a href="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpthoth.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="221" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2012/09/11/symbolism-mind-control-and-metaphysical-sabotage-in-relation-to-archetypal-transference-and-the-second-commandment-of-the-decalogue/12thtrumpthoth-7/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpthoth.jpg" data-orig-size="184,270" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="12thtrumpthoth" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpthoth.jpg?w=184" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpthoth.jpg?w=184" class="alignright size-full wp-image-221" alt="12th Trump from the Thoth Tarot Deck" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpthoth.jpg?w=540" srcset="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpthoth.jpg 184w, https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpthoth.jpg?w=102 102w" sizes="(max-width: 184px) 100vw, 184px"   /></a>archetypes</strong>, which filter into the <strong>collective consciousness</strong> in the form of <strong>memes</strong>, but by putting <strong>implants</strong> in the victim&#8217;s head, they are better able to control what they have already put in place using the &#8220;The Butterfly Effect&#8221; and &#8220;Law of Attraction&#8221; in combination with the tarot, and in my case, it was the 12th trump of the <strong>Thoth</strong> tarot, authored by Aleister Crowley (a known <strong>satanist</strong>), and illustrated by Frieda Harris. As I have written about in other articles, my birthdate being 12/12 unwittingly tied me to the occult magic of the tarot, causing me to live an &#8220;upside-down life&#8221;, as seen in the Hanged Man card from that deck, in which a person is unconscious, upside-down, 3 limbs nailed down, the other foot tied to an upside-down <strong>ankh</strong> (which is the Egyptian heiroglyph for life, by the way), and a serpent attached to the head of the victim with what appear to be rays. The first manifestation of which came in the form of me being forced to write right-handed, when I was naturally left-inclined, which I have written about in my article called, &#8220;The Case for Left-handedness&#8221;.</p>
<p>I often hear people say &#8220;<strong>what goes around comes around</strong>&#8220;. If some one or some group had a specific<strong> intent</strong> of making someone negative against their nature (via this 12th trump card showing a reversed individual), then those who caused it must, in the end, reap the results of the negativity they forced on an unwitting individual, who had no choices, and no knowledge of the curse until much later in life, coincedentally, in the years leading up to <strong>2012</strong>.</p>
<p>In simpler terms: <strong>Any negative karma caused by a curse and/or mind control programming on an individual should never be reaped by the victim of said programming. It would be akin to blaming a puppet for what the puppet master does.</strong></p>
<p>Also, I feel that the only way to restore true freewill to our population is to remove the archetypes, both tarot and astrological. They are truly &#8220;<strong>graven images</strong>&#8220;, in two ways: 1)They are images that have become <strong>engraven</strong> in the <strong>collective unconscious</strong>through<strong> archetypal transference</strong>; &amp; 2) They are images &#8220;frought with danger or harm&#8221; (that quote is from an online dictionary, defining the word &#8220;grave&#8221;, which is why I believe the actual phrase &#8220;Graven Images&#8221; has been removed from the 2nd Commandment in more recent versions of the Bible.</p>

<p>Back in the 1970s, I had this thought that perhaps everything we think we see around us isn’t quite the true reality, and that what we perceive is actually a sort of façade, put in place to keep us from seeing the whole truth about the nature of the world in which human beings exist. I thought of it kind of like a movie screen obstructing our view of the forces at work in our lives. I would later see this concept aptly illustrated in two movies: <strong><em>The Matrix</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Dark City</em></strong>.</p>
<p>The words “<strong>as above, so below</strong>” seem to illustrate this concept (below=the physical &amp; above=the metaphysical) with regards to the archetypes, including tarot, astrology, and the every day <img data-attachment-id="767" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/02/01/welcome-to-lord-of-the-flies-government-style/justiceblind-2/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/justiceblind.jpg" data-orig-size="106,160" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="justiceblind" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/justiceblind.jpg?w=106" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/justiceblind.jpg?w=106" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-767" alt="justiceblind" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/justiceblind.jpg?w=99&#038;h=150" width="99" height="150" srcset="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/justiceblind.jpg?w=99&amp;h=150 99w, https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/justiceblind.jpg 106w" sizes="(max-width: 99px) 100vw, 99px" />archetypes we are exposed to, such as the archetype of <a href="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/09/20/why-is-justice-blind/" target="_blank">justice</a>, which is a perfect example of what is happening in this world, allowing some very evil &amp; greedy people to get away with what basically amounts murder. With regards to astrology: The stars are above and we are below them. How many Leos out there are hogs for the spotlight? How many Aries out there get whatever they want? How many Libras out there think they have the right to judge others? Scorpios are known for being hurtful, and most of the ones I knew were. You often hear about Gemini’s being two-faced. If it isn’t evident on the surface how the person relates to the image of their sign, then it might relate on a deeper, perhaps metaphysical, level. It could simply be a case of what I’ve heard called, “<strong>Archetypal Transference</strong>”. What about Sagittarius? What about Ophiuchus, which has been taken out of the collective group of star signs, even though its feet lie on the ecliptic? Ophiuchus is the sign showing a person holding a serpent, and in some cases, that serpent has been broken. Why did they abolish this sign, I wonder? Could it have something to do with what is known as the <img data-attachment-id="1346" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2012/09/07/as-above-so-below-are-we-programmed-by-archetypes/bisconeserpent/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/bisconeserpent.jpg" data-orig-size="125,160" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="bisconeserpent" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/bisconeserpent.jpg?w=125" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/bisconeserpent.jpg?w=125" class="alignright size-full wp-image-1346" alt="bisconeserpent" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/bisconeserpent.jpg?w=540"   />“<strong>serpent class</strong>”, the <strong>elites</strong> who run the world? Perhaps this means that we should abolish the astrological symbols in general, in an effort to truly allow people to have<strong> freewill</strong>.</p>

<p>I do not say this lightly. Who invented astrology, and why? Well, it depends on which source you accept. It is said that the Chaldean Babylonians who first used the birth charts in relation to the zodiac based on the 12 signs, who brought it to Egypt (<a href="http://www.zodiacal.com/articles/hand/history.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.zodiacal.com/articles/hand/history.htm</a>). The first zodiac was supposedly invented by the Chinese in 2200BC. The first horoscopic zodiac that is close to what is in use today is believed to have been invented by the Greeks, also borrowing from the Chaldeans (<a href="http://www.stargazers.com/kepler1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.stargazers.com/kepler1.html</a>). Perhaps it was an accident that the archetypes, imbedded in our subconscious, have created a basic program for people, depending on their birthdate. An “if, then” statement as in computer programming, would seem to allow for freewill, but it is my contention that it allows for very limited freewill, after a very set and detailed amount of programming has already been put in place, via the archetypes in astrology, as well as in the tarot, which has gained so much in popularity over the past few years.</p>
<p>So the question that would naturally follow is: Do the Tarot and astrology put a certain type of irresistible programming into place, since these archetypes have been around such a long time, and are embedded into our collective subconscious?</p>
<p>What if everything in this world really is like a computer simulation, like in the movie, The Matrix? I ask this because, in addition to the archetypes from the systems mentioned above, I am noticing things in our language that so closely resemble a type of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMe5Y4Hs_7c" target="_blank"><strong>programming</strong></a>, that I have to ask the question, “Are we all merely programmed entities walking around on this planet, none of us truly having freewill?” Are some of us programmed to be negative on purpose, to allow others to be positive? Are some of us programmed to be caring and deeply feeling people while others are programmed to actually hurt people? Are some of us programmed to fail, while others are programmed to succeed? While I do see there are numerous variables regarding <strong>astrology</strong>,<strong> tarot</strong>, and <strong>numerology</strong>, it does seem that we have all been programmed to a certain degree.</p>
<p>Is this what the <strong>second commandment of the Decalogue</strong> really meant, before the Bible had <img data-attachment-id="238" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2012/09/11/symbolism-mind-control-and-metaphysical-sabotage-in-relation-to-archetypal-transference-and-the-second-commandment-of-the-decalogue/12thtrumphermetictarot/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumphermetictarot.gif" data-orig-size="304,500" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="12thTrumpHermeticTarot" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumphermetictarot.gif?w=182" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumphermetictarot.gif?w=304" class="wp-image-238 alignright" alt="12th Trump from The Hermetic Tarot" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumphermetictarot.gif?w=117&#038;h=192" width="117" height="192" />been translated an unknown number of times? Could it be that these images, embedded in the collective unconscious and in the individual’s subconscious, have become “<em>engraven</em>” in our minds? Could it be that the bible was trying to grant freewill to the people, which had previously been taken away via so-called <strong><em>graven images</em></strong>? The Bible tells us that God gave us freewill, but I contend that astrology, the tarot, and even some bible stories, took it away with the use of archetypes, whether people are conscious of the effects or not.</p>
<p>One example of an over-arching archetype affecting our world shows up in the “<strong>Madonna-Whore</strong>” complex, as described by Freud, except that it not only affects men in our world. In the Christian story about Jesus and the crucifixion, we have two Mary’s: Jesus’ mother, and Mary Magdalene. Does this create a subversive and subliminal complex in women based on the meme perpetuated by this story?</p>

For example, think about the Aries you know, especially those born in the 4th month, who are thus given the Emperor card, or the Leos born in the 8th month, who are given Strength. The 5th trump of most tarot decks is called the Hierophant, and I wish I knew someone born on 5/5 (Taurus), to see what their life pattern has been. Is it correct to give so many others a position of power (4th trump) or abundance (3rd trump), and then force the 12th trump to be the Hanged Man (called the Dying God in the Thoth deck)?</p>
<p>I feel that the occultists who seem to be running the world have put very powerful programs into place via the tarot, astrology, evil magic, technology, and even our language, to make people generally  unwell, and even argumentative. It is all very symbolic. One only needs to look at words and their roots to see how they can have symbolic and subliminal effects on people, to understand that images have a similar effect which is much more subtle. For example, someone could have the name Bill, which could be seen as “Be ill”, and it might subliminally affect either those reading the name, or the one who has that name. Consider the word television that phonetically sounds like “tell-a-vision”. An example I find most interesting is the word “music”, which is broken down to two words, <a href="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/mu1.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="155" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2012/09/07/as-above-so-below-are-we-programmed-by-archetypes/mu1/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/mu1.jpg" data-orig-size="275,183" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="MU1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/mu1.jpg?w=275" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/mu1.jpg?w=275" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-155 alignright" alt="MU1" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/mu1.jpg?w=150&#038;h=99" width="150" height="99" srcset="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/mu1.jpg?w=150&amp;h=99 150w, https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/mu1.jpg 275w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a><strong>Mu:</strong> the 12<sup>th</sup> letter of the Greek alphabet, and <strong>Sic:</strong> “as intentionally so written”.</p>
<p>Much programming could very easily be put into people’s minds based on their name alone, much less via tarot and astrological archetypes. For example, do people with the name “Michael” subconsciously believe that they are angels, or “of God”, and have a certain amount of power over others?  Someone who has initials that spell “dog” or “cat”, might subconsciously identify with that animal, which could create an extra sensitive nature in that person, but could also serve to <strong>dehumanize</strong> them. Identifying with an animal would be a double-edged sword, to say the least, considering that most people believe animals to be more sensitive than people. So would being named after an animal be some sort of curse, making someone have experiences that others will automatically deny, simply because they don’t experience them? <strong>It is akin to the situation of doctors in 1920 calling someone crazy because they didn’t have the right microscopes to see the disease from which their patient was suffering.</strong></p>
<p>While being outside of a room where a <a href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2014/02/26/brain-washing-social-control-programming-kill-your-television/" target="_blank">television</a> (tell-a-vision) set was on, I could hear a subliminal message being delivered, that said, “abuse her”. This was at a house where a 40 year old man and his <img data-attachment-id="927" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/07/04/mind-control-and-the-targeted-individual/tvmc/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/tvmc.jpg" data-orig-size="160,142" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="TVMC" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/tvmc.jpg?w=160" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/tvmc.jpg?w=160" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-927 alignleft" alt="TVMC" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/tvmc.jpg?w=150&#038;h=133" width="150" height="133" srcset="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/tvmc.jpg?w=150&amp;h=133 150w, https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/tvmc.jpg 160w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />86 year old mother were living. Interestingly enough, the mother often had complaints of him pinching her and pushing her (although she never told me that he hit her). I often saw cuts and bruises on this woman. Was he influenced, albeit subconsciously, to believe that because he was “of God”, simply because his name was Michael, that it was okay to push his elderly mother around? Was it somehow easier for my own mother to berate and degrade me because she and I subconsciously identified me with an animal?</p>
<p>All my life, I have felt like there was something not quite right about things in our world. It seems like I had been living under a curse of <strong>self-fulfilling prophecies</strong> and rampant <a href="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/09/29/memes-law-of-attraction-2/" target="_blank"><strong>memes</strong></a>, resulting from the amplification of the &#8220;upsidedown&#8221; hanged man archetype, through a growth in popularity of the tarot &amp; numerous printings of over 1000 different tarot decks. My parents were upper middle class, and so I was left with various nannies for the first 9 years of my life. After their divorce, my mother didn’t have to work, yet she left me alone most of the time. I’d had bad experiences with doctors, dentists, and oral surgeons. Teachers were often unfair and unkind to me. My art career, while I had received a scholarship at the school I attended, had somehow been sabotaged by other artists. For example, one artist stole my ideas, while another wrecked one of my paintings. While I always did my best at my jobs, and usually became the top performer, I was never able to climb the corporate ladder. After much considerations of astrology and the tarot, I have come to the conclusion that, in my case, these archetypes (especially that of the 12<sup>th</sup> trump of the tarot) caused a pattern in my life, over which I had no control. This issue refutes the idea of freewill as an absolute, which contradicts what most of us are told as we grow up.</p>
<p>I contend that these two supposed tools for divination do not allow for much freewill, for we all seem to be behaving within the parameters set up by these archetypes, which are in the collective consciousness. What tarot and horoscope readings denote to the reader and the querant obscure what these images do to the collective consciousness, as well as the individual mind that views them.</p>
<p>At any rate… how can anyone, who has been programmed by these archetypes, be blamed for their behavior that is a direct result of (often a reaction to) such programming? It would be interesting to do a study on people over 40, born on specific double digit birthdates, as in relation to their star sign as well as the corresponding major arcana card from the tarot, just to see how their lives had turned out.</p>
<p>I have documented my own situation with mind control programming, in relation to my birthdate (a double digit), and how it was used with the tarot to create a general curse in my life, and I have met other people with double digit birthdates who have suffered under similar circumstances.
