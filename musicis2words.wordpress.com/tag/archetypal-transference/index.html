<p align="center"><strong>Born Into Slavery</strong></p>
</div>
<p>In 2009, I was told by a complete stranger on the street that I was “<em>sold into slavery</em>”. Given the events of my life, and the fact that I was adopted through a Catholic agency, it is not out of the realm of possibility. It did not take me much research to learn of the history <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/forced-adoptions-for-unwed-mothers-around-the-globe.html" target="_blank">Catholic organizations have with child trafficking</a>, dating back in the 1960s, at least. I have been told that I was sold into slavery with the specific purpose of being a <em>ritual sacrifice</em>. There is no justification for what was done to me.  There may be more to be added to this document in the future, but I wanted to get it out before I die, or am imprisoned for some crime I haven’t committed. I fear this might be done in order to silence me. I have found myself to be a TI (<strong>Targeted Individual</strong>), but given the events in my life, I feel I have always been a target.</p>
<p>Before reading this, I would like you to have an answer to a common question I get from people who doubt what I am saying is true. I have had people ask me, &#8220;<strong>Why you</strong>?&#8221;, &#8220;Why would they pick you?&#8221;, and my favorite, &#8220;<strong>What makes you so special</strong>?&#8221;</p>
<p>Here is my answer: Why <em>not</em> me? I mean, if I am part of some experiment, does that question have any relevance at all? You might as well ask <a href="http://psychology.about.com/od/historyofpsychology/p/harlow_love.htm" target="_blank">why Harry Harlow picked a particular monkey to be used in an experiment</a>, or <a href="http://http://www.wireheading.com/delgado/brainchips.pdf" target="_blank">what made Dr. Jose Delgado use that particular cat for his experiment with brain stimulation</a>? I was adopted &amp; the records were sealed, so I</p>
<p><img class="alignleft" alt="This is from an  experiment done in the early 1950s, where a cat was made to lift its hind leg in response to brain stimulation." src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/delgado-cat.jpg?w=150&#038;h=91" width="150" height="91" /></p>
<p>don&#8217;t know if my birth mother was from some bloodline or not. I don&#8217;t know the circumstances surrounding my adoption. Just being adopted through a catholic agency puts one at risk for being stolen, which then puts one at risk for becoming an unwitting participant in a <em>human experimentation</em> program. Of course, I am not implying that all adoptees are victims of <strong>nonconsensual human experimentation</strong>, only that they are at a greater risk for it, since their records are often sealed. After seeing a show on TV where a baby was being taken from its mother, I wondered if I cried like that was I was taken from my birth mother.</p>
<p>I do not know how long the implants have been there. I believe it may have been done to me when I was a newborn, during the adoption process. I suspect this to be the case, since I was in a hospital for a period of time after my birth, &amp; since I never had pain at the cites of the implants. They go all the way through the cartilage in each ear. I need to have a doctor look at them, perhaps with a CT, MRI, or PET scan, although I prefer to have at least one of them removed. Since I have lost my job and have no insurance, this is hard to do. It doesn’t seem like anyone is willing to truly help me with this. Here are the photos of them:</p>

<p><a href="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/rfid_rice_fingers.png"><img alt="RFIDRiceFingersComparison" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/rfid_rice_fingers.png?w=150&#038;h=150" width="150" height="150" /></a> This is an image I found at &#8220;lovingenergies.com&#8221;, showing the size of RFID chips. The implants in my ears are exactly that size.</p>
<p>It should be noted here that the word <a href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=psyche" target="_blank">&#8220;<strong>psyche</strong>&#8221; <strong>refers to the spirit</strong></a>, in both Greek &amp; Latin. Thus psychology most likely refers to the study of the spirit, but they don&#8217;t tell you that in school.</p>
<p>In 2008, I began to audibly hear what is being transmitted through these implants. I also found myself in near constant pain in my privates. The psychologist I saw, since I was made to appear delusional, tells me that I just have to live with the pain, but this is not really living. When I told her about the implants, which are very provable, she replied that they could be keloids, which are scars. This not possible, considering what keloids look like versus what I have on my ears. These are keloids:<img class="alignright" title="Keyloid" alt="Keloid Example" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/keyloidc.jpg?w=254&#038;h=198" width="254" height="198" /></p>
<p>Keloids (photo shown right) are ON the skin, while what I have is clearly UNDER the skin. I hear voices through the implants, and I also feel what can only be described as “impact sensations” through them. I had one person tell me that they were cutaneous horns, but those are also on the surface of the skin, not under it. Given the fact that I was adopted through a <em>catholic agency</em>, it is very possible that these implants have been with me my whole life, since the Catholic church certainly has more than one black mark on it&#8217;s record concerning it&#8217;s treatment of children.</p>
<p>When I discovered my implants in 2008, began to uncover my memories, and notice how orchestrated my life has been, I became a target for the worst kind of <strong>character assassination</strong>. I lost my job, my family, my world. I was abandoned in a foreclosed house, in which I lived with no power or water for almost 3 years. No one would help me, and the only way I could get a ride, or a warm place to stay during the coldest winter nights was if I allowed certain men to kiss and/or touch me.</p>
<p>I believe the implants in my head have been a major part of my problem throughout my life, &amp; that, had I not been implanted, my life would have turned out very differently. A little research into the work of Dr.s <a href="http://cabinetmagazine.org/issues/2/psychcivilization.php" target="_blank">Jose Delgado</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.wanttoknow.info/mkcourtcase.shtml" target="_blank">Ewen Cameron</a> (to name a couple), whose work in mind control goes as far back as the 1940s in some cases, will show that this is indeed possible. It is not only possible, but very likely, that these implants have been delivering subliminal messages throughout my life, or at least throughout their existence in my head. The proof is in the photos above. No one can say I am delusional regarding their existence or their placement in my head. I hear voices throughout them telling me I am a demon, or Satan himself, and that I am being killed &amp; sent to hell. How’s that for a mind #@*!? I also hear high-pitched tones (on one side or the other-not ringing), and feel impact sensations, coming through these implants that I cannot seem to get a doctor to look at. Sometimes, the voices will tell me I am going to be framed for something, but I am a completely law-abiding citizen. Voices that were once subliminal are now broadcast 247 into my head to keep me in terror by calling me a criminal even though I am breaking no laws, telling me I am marked for death, going to jail, that I am just food, etc. At one point, I was at an amusement park with my daughter watching a show, when I felt a directed energy weapon attack: it felt like a hot poker going into my back and straight through my left lung, which I am sure is done to make it look like I died of lung cancer.</p>
<p>I must be a victim of either MK Ultra or the Monarch program, not only because I have these implants, not only because I had the classic near-drowning at 3y/o, or have had programming terms spill out into my conscious mind, but because it simply looks like my entire life has been orchestrated for the specific purpose of making me negative and to turn me away from God. At any rate, I can show that I have not been allowed much “freewill”, and its ending result was one of catastrophe. I am not even sure “freewill” even exists, hence the quotations. <strong>I urge any target reading this to read it completely, and then examine your own life</strong> <strong>to see how you may have been manipulated in relation to your name and/or birthdate, especially in regards to music and movies, as well as the tarot, used as a programming device, as opposed to a fortune-telling device. </strong>I am the victim of what can only be called <em>Mind Control</em>, regardless of what program was used. Taken separately, the events of my life may not look like Mind Control to most people, but when considered together, it cannot be denied that what happened to me was a classic PSYOPS experience or experiment, resembling The Truman Show, except in my case, I was debased, debilitated, and dehumanized on a fundamental level, whereas in the movie, they show the main character was raised by loving and attentive parents. After what I have learned about myself, and what I have witnessed in this country and the world, I am now forced to consider that the kinds of things that were done to me are occurring, in some level (even if a more subtle level), on a global scale, in order to make the whole of society unbalanced and unwell, and thereby easily manipulated by the hidden ones in power and the power structure. I am not writing this to disrespect my parents, which will be seen as my story continues below, as I know they too were controlled by this machine.</p>
<p>I have learned that certain occult brotherhoods, interested in making blood sacrifices, will force a woman to give birth on a certain day. I believe that my birthmother was more than likely induced to have me on 12/12, because of the predominance of that number in our culture, and its association in most tarot decks. I was adopted at 6 weeks, but I remember a photo of my father holding me and I looked like a newborn, which makes me think I was premature. They would do this to make sure that I would be weak and more easily manipulated.</p>
<p>The classic near-drowning at 3 years old, which I will document below, is known to be used in mind control &amp; ritual abuse. <a href="http://healthland.time.com/2013/01/16/childhood-trauma-leaves-legacy-of-brain-changes/" target="_blank"><strong>Trauma</strong> such as this causes actual changes within the brain</a>. I believe that the ritual drowning at 3y/o is done on purpose to contribute to destroying people&#8217;s true potential &amp; making them easier to control. Adoption itself is a trauma, in that it is not natural for a baby to be separated from their natural parents at birth.</p>
<p>Another thing that shows I was manipulated to be negative is the fact that I was forced to write with the right hand, against my natural inclination to be left-handed. This was done by telling me, when I was learning to write, that left-handedness was evil. If the right hemisphere of the brain generally controls the left side of the body, as evidenced in studies of stroke victims, what does this imply for someone who is naturally left-handed, but forced to be right-handed? Is it possible that doing this to me could have “<strong>switched my poles</strong>”, causing a bright and intelligent child to slowly lose her natural God given gifts? Is it also possible that switching someone’s natural handedness could make them negative, less intelligent, unbalanced, and emotionally unstable? I believe it should be looked into. I believe that changing my natural, God given, left-handed nature caused me to lose ambition, creating a state of apathy &amp; confusion, over time, and is at least partly responsible for my negativity. This is evidenced by the fact that when I was in grade school, I had a high IQ, and was in the top 2% of my class, but over time, my grades fell dramatically. I was lucky to graduate high school with a C average. While my mother’s negative influence in my life is, of course, partly responsible for this, I would have most likely been more self-motivated, had I been allowed to keep my natural left-handedness. This could also have something to do with what I document next.</p>
<p>There are many who believe that the tarot can be used to tell someone&#8217;s future, and others who would say it is meant to help people work through their psychological issues, but given my story, and how much it relates to a certain tarot deck (A. Crowley&#8217;s Thoth deck), I find myself thinking that these images had an unnatural and cruel programming type of an effect on my life, as did many other things in art, music, movies, and TV. After a certain amount of detective work, I have learned why.</p>
<p><strong>“Life imitates art far more than art imitates life” –Oscar Wilde</strong></p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, I was born on 12/12/1967. I think it is very possible that the assignment of the number 12 in the trumps of almost every tarot deck, in addition to the prevalence of the number 12 in the bible and in culture, has also had a subliminal effect on me throughout my life, having a specific impact on my ego. In the tarot, the 12th card of the major arcana is usually The Hanged Man, an upsidedown person. Due to the patterns of my life closely relating to the Thoth deck, I feel that I may have been programmed with it. I have met one other person with a 12/12 birthdate, and he also feels like his whole life has been cursed. I certainly cannot deny the possibility, given the fact that my adoptive mother, born on 4/4, had a life that mimics exactly the 4<sup>th</sup> trump in that deck. In the Thoth deck, the Hanged Man’s right foot is tied to an upsidedown Ankh, which is the Egyptian symbol for life and fertility. I find it sad that my ideas about life and fertility were always skewed in this way, although I had not known about this card for the majority of my life. As far as I know, I had never seen it, however, I must now question if I was shown this card in my youth, as some part of a mind control program. I only say this because of its serious and deleterious effect on my life. While I knew of my birthdate, I never really associated myself to that number on a conscious level, rather I have always identified with the number 3, possibly because I was baptized Catholic and received first communion.  I have to wonder if being born on this birthdate has affected others in similar ways, but I suspect that it depends on how the person is raised (including trauma in early childhood) in addition to their birthdate, name, numerology, tarot correspondences, and astrological sign, in addition to whether they were part of this mind control program that I seem to have been put through.</p>
<p>When one takes into account the occult nature of those who would be involved in such practices as <strong>MK Ultra</strong> and the <strong>Monarch Program</strong>, it is very possible that the tarot was used in conjunction with dark magic and mindcontrol, to create a peculiar pattern in my life that closely resembled the energy of the Hanged Man card throughout most of my life, causing me to blame God for everything in my life, turn away from the church given its history of killings and hypocrisy, and eventually sign a contract with a character named Enki (a Sumerian god), whom I was mindcontrolled into believing was the true God. I was only searching for the One True God of the Universe, and everything the churches were seen to be doing turned me away from them. By forcing my life into such a negative pattern (inverted-like the Hanged Man card), as you will see if you read this whole document, it was easy to turn me away from the God of the bible, making me believe that the bible lied. Given how the images from the tarot have affected me &amp; other people I know, however, I now understand why the second commandment in the Bible states, &#8220;<strong>No Graven Images</strong>&#8220;. This is about something called &#8220;<a href="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2012/09/07/as-above-so-below-are-we-programmed-by-archetypes" target="_blank"><strong>archetypal transference</strong></a>&#8220;.</p>
<p>Here are pictures of the, The Emperor and The Hanged Man, from the Thoth tarot:</p>
<dl class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_98" style="width:195px;">
<dt><img title="4thTrumpThoth" alt="4th Trump of the Thoth Tarot deck" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/4thtrumpthoth1.jpg?w=185&#038;h=272" width="185" height="272" /></dt>
</dl>
<p>While it seems that we have all been mind controlled to some degree, I see my case as slightly different from most people, only because of my mother’s 4/4 birthdate and my 12/12 birthdate, and how they were used against me. My mother’s card, The Emperor has so many symbols relating to her life that it was impossible for me to ignore. There are two rams (Aries) behind her (they &#8220;had her back&#8221; so to speak): the one on the left, representing my father, who always took care of her even after the divorce; and the ghostly one on the right, my grandmother who is deceased. The figure has one 8-point star in a circle (eight balls?) on either side, which represent my cousin and my brother, both born in August, whom she regarded fondly. The lamb at the bottom, represents me, from whom she was always looking away. This lamb is holding a flag, &amp; one could say I was a flag waver for certain causes, such as Greenpeace (back in the 1980s). The Emperor is holding a ball with an equal-armed cross on it, so it is a coincidence that my mom was a trophy-winning bowler?</p>
<p><a href="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/12thtrumpthoth3.jpg"> </a></p>
<p>In my case, The Hanged Man is nailed down and unconscious, symbolizing how I have been unaware of what has been happening to me my entire life. Already mentioned is the fact that the figure is hanging upsidedown, from the Egyptian symbol for life and fertility, which shows how my entire life has been inverted. The fact that the figure has no clearly definable genitalia (just a lump of flesh in that position), is significant of castration, symbolic <img class="alignright" title="12thtrumpthoth" alt="12th Trump Thoth Tarot" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/12thtrumpthoth3.jpg?w=184&#038;h=270" width="184" height="270" />of the pain I am in today and have been suffering from since the middle of 2008. The serpent in the card represents the serpent class (or satan), connected via rays to the figure’s head, makes it seem that they are able to read my thoughts, to be displayed in some <em>altered</em> form, in movies, TV, but especially in music. One example of how my life has been played out in some form, in music, can be seen in the Beatles&#8217; song, &#8220;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&#8221;, where George Harrison sings: &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how you were inverted.&#8221; Another example would be the Kate Bush song, “Experiment IV” (4th trump=Emperor), in which she describes “a sound that could kill someone from a distance”, which relates to all the negative energies sent to me from my adoptive mother with that 4/4 birthdate. It is already well known that mind control is often addressed in music &amp; movies. One thing I want to note here is that the things they are doing to mind control victims are played out in music in movies, so that when anyone complains of the effects of targeting and mind control, they can be dismissed as delusional (&#8220;Ah, you&#8217;ve been watching too many movies, man&#8221;). However, all one has to do is see how, even some political candidates, such as Connie Marshall (KY), and celebrities, such as Randy Quaid (his case told on YouTube), are now complaining of targeting, to understand that this is anything but a delusion.</p>

Notice, for example, the following words: Bill, chill, mill, kill, till, all have the root words “ill” in them; and how the words bow, chow, cow, pow, sow, all have the root “ow” in them. It might mean nothing, yet it could still have a <em>subliminal effect</em>. I looked up the word “music” as two distinct words; <strong>mu</strong> and <strong>sic</strong>. Taken individually, they are defined as follows: <strong>Mu</strong>&#8211; 12th letter of the Greek alphabet, a lost continent in the Pacific Ocean, an opiate receptor, among many other things, and is a root in many words in the English language; and <strong>Sic</strong>&#8211; Intentionally so written, As written, A command to attack (as in “sic the dog”). That being said, one also has to take into consideration the sound of the word, “music”, as in “<strong>muse sick</strong>”. When I think of these definitions, and the way my life has been, I realize that my life seems orchestrated by some unknown entity, and I am praying that God would not do this to an individual. For example, my initials happen to spell “cat” (although my mother has confessed to not really liking cats), and when I was in school to be an artist, a woman entered that school, with the last name of “Skinner”, and somehow she was able to end up with many of my ideas without me telling her. I see this as related to the phrase, “skin the cat”. Later, she would introduce me to heroin at a vulnerable time in my life, which helped to ruin my career &amp; my life.</p>
<p>My initials, C.A.T., seem to have been given to me, with the specific intent of <em>dehumanization </em>(possibly as part of this sick experiment). I have read that many</p>
<p><img class="alignright" alt="Monarch Butterfly Cat" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/monarchbutterflycatp.jpg?w=150&#038;h=110" width="150" height="110" /></p>
<p>survivors of the Monarch program are given “cat alters”, although I am not a multiple personality. I do think I have repressed memories, since I have heard programming break through to my conscious mind. I am a Mind Control victim who was adopted (as some would say, &#8220;<em>sold into slavery</em>&#8220;) through Catholic Charities, but was held in the agency&#8217;s custody for the first six weeks of my life, creating an attachment disorder, causing me to be a very emotionally needy child. Unfortunately, my adoptive parents were either unable or unwilling to fill this need. I ask myself why my mother would me name me something with the initials spelling CAT, when she never really liked cats. My parents had a natural born, ten year old boy when I was adopted. My mother’s maiden name was Gaeta, so when she married, it became Nay Gaeta &#8220;negator&#8221;, which is a cruel symbolic irony regarding the effect she had on my life. She was in her thirties when I was adopted. She smoked three packs of cigarettes a day, which is possibly why she had two miscarriages before I was born. She used a method of child-rearing, common in the 1960s, which advocated leaving the child to cry and/or scream for hours in the crib without responding. This method of caring for a baby is cruel, and I cannot imagine why anyone who loved their children would do this. I am sure that it causes or contributes what is known as “attachment disorder”. My parents were upper middle class, so in the absence of love, they gave me material things. My father, working a job that kept him out of town frequently, wasn&#8217;t around much, and I felt his absence. Although she seldom had to work, my mother was also never around much, leaving the raising of me up to myself, and various nannies that would come and go during the first nine years of my life. My brother, who was ten years older than me, was usually away at boarding school. I had the classic near-drowning at 3 years old (common among Ritual Abuse victims), and I am told that my brother saved my life when I was found floating face-down in the pool, although considering the accounts of RA victims and participants (who are also victims) throughout the world, I now have no idea what the real truth is.  In any case, it is possible that this was a <strong>ritual drowning</strong>, done to bring me to a near death experience, which would then allow for spiritual and demonic influence in my life, and/or easier mind control.</p>
<p>My brother has told me that our mother was caught shaking him when he was a baby, and had to be watched, which is why we ended up with nannies during the first eight or nine years of my life. If this is true, I have to wonder where our nanny was when I fell out of the crib during one of those times when I was left to scream in the crib, by myself. That being said, I do know that my mother had an obvious mean streak in her (The Emperor-remember), and I did witness her beating on my brother when I was around five, and he was fifteen. I know she was beaten by her own father, and I suspect she was sexually abused as well, so I am not trying to show disrespect for her or my father, as I know they were both victims of their own programming, as were their parents before them.</p>
<p>My parents got divorced when I was around 9 years old, and I took it hard because I really needed my dad in my life. My dad moved out of state, and my mother and I moved out of the family home. We ended up in the place where <strong>I spent the second half of my childhood, in a literal house of mirrors</strong>. This is why <strong>I call it PSYOPS (PSYchological OPerationS), because living in a house of mirrors during my childhood had a direct psychological impact on me</strong>. We had mirrored bedroom suites, mirrored coffee table, mirrored wallpaper, a mirrored pedestal with a steel sculpture, mirrored sliding closet doors, mirrored shower doors, mirrored art on the wall, mirrored tissue dispensers, mirrored cotton ball holders, and even mirrored outlets and switch plates. I am not exaggerating here. There was only one room in the house that didn’t have this décor, and it still had one big mirror on the back wall, behind the bar. I know this had an effect on me as a child. After reading the book about mind control, by <a href="http://www.emhdf.com/Monarch-mind-control.pdf" target="_blank">Fritz Springmeier &amp; Cisco Wheeler</a>, I learned about the use of mirrors in mind control, it just seems to have been done differently in my case.</p>
<p>By the time I entered my teens, I became a rebel and got into the punk music scene, which only fueled the fire, so to speak. While I was never a racist, I did end up doing some very negative things, but I never committed murder. I was involved in some ugly behaviors with friends though, such as playing around in graveyards. The lack of a father figure left me easily influenced by boyfriends, throughout my life. Since my mother was never around when I was growing up, and when she was, she mostly gave negative feedback, I had very little encouragement, causing me to be lonely and angry. I felt bullied by her for the most part. She gave very little love, and just seemed to want to spend all her time with her friends. She was an avid bowler (see the image of the 4<sup>th</sup> trump of the Thoth deck above), and would drag me to smoke-filled bowling alleys. She smoked 3 packs of cigarettes a day throughout my infancy and childhood, keeping a smoke-filled home &amp; car, which not only gave me asthma, but also a nicotine addiction. Instead of trying to reason with me, my mother would yell at me for bad behavior, with the following recurring theme: “You are stupid, stupid, stupid, and you’re never going to amount to anything!”, among other similar negative feedback patterns, which is, of course, more PSYOPS (as if the mirrors weren&#8217;t enough).</p>
<p>I have forgiven my parents for what they did because I know they must be victims of their own programming, or were coerced into adopting me and leaving me alone throughout most of my childhood, possibly as part of the experiment. My parents may have been unwitting participants in the scheme that I have witnessed occurring in my life, being victims of their own upbringing, so I have forgiven them, but I cannot forget the fact that neither of my parents were around much when I was growing up, which caused me to be quite emotionally needy, a quality that helped to destroy my life before I ever had a chance. <strong>There are many children who have suffered through similar divorce effects in their lives, however, the implants, the mirrors, the near-drowning at 3y/o, the adoption, and the symbolism I have referenced are simply too much for me to chalk up to a &#8220;child of divorce syndrome&#8221;.</strong></p>
<p>Although I might’ve been guilty of taking a few dollars from my mother here and there, during my teen years, I never stole large amounts of cash from her. When I was 17 years old, however, I got accused of stealing her wallet, which had $800 cash and her credit cards. While I know I did not do this because I fell asleep and woke up on the phone with my boyfriend at the time, she allowed the police to take me in for questioning, who then coerced me into a false confession. I don’t know if the police just wanted a scapegoat, or if this was a part of PSYOPS done on me to make me fear police and other officials so I would be afraid to go to them for help. It also made me more of a rebel. This event helped to ruin my relationship with my mother.</p>
<p>When I began to have memories resurface about mistreatment in my life, I became a target for what is known as <strong>PSYOPS</strong>, <strong>COINTELPRO</strong>, and <strong>Electronic Harassment</strong>. I began to hear voices through the implants on my head, done in order to discredit me. At first, they sent me positive messages, making me feel loved and cared for, but this soon turned to horrible and cruel words, designed to make me very sad and negative. Any professional I see wants to make me out to be schizophrenic, but won’t even do me the courtesy of getting these things on my head examined by a medical doctor. This tells me they are either in denial or are criminally negligent.</p>
<p>My mother was involved in a class action lawsuit against the tobacco companies which was won back in 2008 (or so my brother told me). My mother has passed away, and during the height of my breakdown involving the voices coming through my implants, and while I was living in that foreclosed house without water or power, my brother got me to sign over executorship of my mother’s estate. This leads me to believe that something fishy is going on. If anyone cares, please say a prayer for me. While me standing to inherent a large sum of money that a particular tobacco company might not want to pay could be one reason for my targeting, the implants in my ears lead me to believe this has been going on since my early childhood.</p>
<p>As noted, there may be more to this document to come, but I wanted to get it out before I die, or am imprisoned for some crime I haven’t committed. I fear this might be done in order to silence me.</p>

<p><strong>(Metaphysical Forensics)</strong></p>
<p>If you ever wonder how big corporations &amp; wealthy, elitist families have been able to amass so much power &amp; get away with so many crimes (often swept under the rug, hidden from the masses), you might consider the <i>law of attraction</i> &amp; the <i>archetype</i> of &#8220;<i>Lady Justice</i>&#8220;. Although, after what I have seen, it would be more accurate to call this an &#8220;<i>arche-typo</i>&#8220;, because it certainly seems to be in error. Sadly, I know it was anything <i>but</i> an accident that justice has indeed been made blind.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>I have covered <strong>the &#8220;Justice is Blind&#8221; <em>meme</em></strong> in multiple documents online, as well as in some videos. I am writing about this in yet another article because it<strong> is the biggest example that shows proof for what I call &#8220;<em>archetypal transference</em>&#8220;,</strong> which has been used to manipulate reality, to the benefit of the powerful &amp; wealthy, &amp; to the detriment of the mind-controlled masses.</p>
<p><strong>ar·che·type</strong> (from dictionary.reference.com)</p>
<p>[ahr-ki-tahyp] noun</p>
<p>1. the original pattern or model <span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">from which</span><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"> all things of the same kind are copied or on which they are based; a model or first form; prototype. </span></p>
<p>2. (in Jungian psychology) a collectively inherited unconscious idea, pattern of thought, image<span style="font-family:Times New Roman;">, etc., universally present in individual psyches. </span></p>
<p><strong>transference </strong>(from freedictionary.com)</p>
<p>[ˈtrænsfərəns -frəns] <i>n</i></p>
<p>1. the act or an instance of transferring or the state of being transferred.</p>
<p>2. (Psychoanalysis) <i>Psychoanal</i> the redirection of attitudes and emotions towards a substitute, such as towards the analyst during therapy.</p>
<p>How many times have you heard the phrase &#8220;<strong>Justice is Blind</strong>&#8221; repeated in your life? You might assume it means that justice is fair &amp; impartial, but is that really what it means? Have <img data-attachment-id="1510" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/11/21/how-do-they-get-away-with-it/blindjusticesculpture/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/blindjusticesculpture.jpg" data-orig-size="160,230" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="blindjusticesculpture" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/blindjusticesculpture.jpg?w=160" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/blindjusticesculpture.jpg?w=160" class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-1510" alt="blindjusticesculpture" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/blindjusticesculpture.jpg?w=104&#038;h=150" width="104" height="150" srcset="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/blindjusticesculpture.jpg?w=104&amp;h=150 104w, https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/blindjusticesculpture.jpg 160w" sizes="(max-width: 104px) 100vw, 104px" />you ever noticed what the archetypal image of &#8220;Lady Justice&#8221; looks like? She is most commonly shown blindfolded, holding scales &amp; a sword. This means that the archetype of justice cares not about the way people are mind controlled into doing or becoming things that are looked down upon, as long as the scales are balanced.</p>
<p>So the corporation that poisons the majority of the population of one country is &#8220;A-Okay&#8221; in her book, as long as they provide housing or healthcare for the starving peoples of another country.</p>
<p>What?!</p>
<p>Oh, wait&#8230; that&#8217;s right&#8230; she&#8217;s blind! No wonder!</p>

No matter how you feel about smokers or ex-smokers trying to sue the big tobacco companies, some of you may remember a time when doctors were telling their patients that smoking was healthy &amp; led to a longer life.</p>
<p>From healio.com:</p>
<p>&#8220;Companies like Phillip Morris and RJ Reynolds participated in medical conventions by sponsoring doctors’ lounges and giving away free cigarettes. But the most inventive method to influence physicians was RJ Reynolds’s creation of its Medical Relations Division.&#8221;</p>
<p>Several years ago, there were major, class action lawsuits aganst certain tobacco companies. In some<img data-attachment-id="1341" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/11/21/how-do-they-get-away-with-it/camel2_250_324_37712/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/camel2_250_324_37712.jpg" data-orig-size="250,324" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="Camel2_250_324_37712" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/camel2_250_324_37712.jpg?w=231" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/camel2_250_324_37712.jpg?w=250" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1341" alt="Camel2_250_324_37712" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/camel2_250_324_37712.jpg?w=231&#038;h=300" width="231" height="300" srcset="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/camel2_250_324_37712.jpg?w=231&amp;h=300 231w, https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/camel2_250_324_37712.jpg?w=116&amp;h=150 116w, https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/camel2_250_324_37712.jpg 250w" sizes="(max-width: 231px) 100vw, 231px" /> cases, these lawsuits were won by the claimants because it was proven that the companies knowingly caused their product to be more addictive than natural tobacco is. So, now these families are awaiting the money, from the tobacco companies, awarded to them by the courts. It is taking them years to pay these claimants, &amp; in the meanwhile, the victims are slowly dying off. It is probably similar in most class-action lawsuits against powerful corporations.</p>
<p>How were companies able to get away with this stuff then? How do companies pushing genetically modified foods &amp; hormonally tampered with farm animals get away with it now?</p>
<p>Check that &#8220;Justice is Blind&#8221; archetype, &amp; consider how often the idea &amp; phrase are repeated by people in the general population. I contend it is one of the biggest reasons why big companies have been able to get away with so many injustices in this world.</p>
<p>Also, please consider the fact that this phrase has been around Since about the 15th century. This means that the phrase has been repeated by an ignorant public for what &#8211; 5 centuries now? If you are familiar with <strong>Law of Attraction</strong>, then you understand the ramifications of so many people repeating such a phrase for so many years. So, just what have we unwittingly attracted to ourselves?</p>

I talked about how these movies become a form of <em>programming</em>, causing a little girl to subconsciously identify with the princess role, and unconsciously project the roles of other characters onto prominent people in her life. I mention how these movies, and the reinforcement of their programming via countless princess products on the market, seem to have the effect of causing females to be “<em>high-maintenance</em>”, and drive a wedge between mothers and daughters on a subconscious level. I also mention how <em>sexual subliminals</em> serve to inhibit spiritual growth by focusing the subconscious mind on baser desires in general.</p>
<p>What I neglected to discuss in the original document (<a href="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/02/25/archetypaltransferencedisneyprincessmovies" rel="nofollow">https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/02/25/archetypaltransferencedisneyprincessmovies</a>) is a concept known as “<strong>learned </strong><strong>helplessness</strong>”. This form of learned helplessness differs from the more commonly known definition of the term, which describes an animal or person who experiences this effect when they are exposed to repetitive abuse and trauma, with no escape (see below). The form of learned helplessness I am referring to comes as a result of being programmed by movies that feature the male “<em>hero</em>”, and the female “<em>damsel in distress</em>”. By and large, the majority of princess films and action movies reinforce these archetypes, and encourage females to subconsciously play the role of victim who will ultimately be rescued, which sets them up to be victimized for real, as they become adults, only, in many cases, that rescue never comes.</p>
<p>A key point here is that a female, who has been programmed in this way, winds up with a <em>victim mentality</em> &amp; tends to identify herself in relation to her mate. This allows for very limited personal, emotional, intellectual, or spiritual development, which may result in an inability to become a whole person in her own right, depending on how extensive her programming is.</p>
<p>As I mentioned in my earlier document, the effects of this programming may vary, depending on the amount of <b>trauma</b> in a person’s life, due to the effects of trauma on the brain.</p>
<p>Not only are little girls programmed by these so-called feminine archetypes, but boys are usually programmed to be completely different, so men and women end up having personalities which seem to conflict. This programming seems to begin at birth, when boys are assigned blue and girls are assigned pink. On the color wheel, pink and blue are neither side-by-side, nor are they compliments. So on a symbolic level, males and females are immediately programmed to conflict with each other. I cover this in more detail in another article.</p>
<p>There does seem to be an agenda out there to disempower women on a subconscious level. While there are some movies out there that show strong female characters, the majority of fantasy and action movies especially, feature a strong male who must rescue a helpless, or at least less capable, female. Another type of programming in these movies can be seen in how the male role has growth and character development that is not found, or is negligible, in the female role.</p>
<p>Being exposed to these archetypes, over and over again, certainly becomes a form of subconscious programming.</p>
<p>Again I find myself wanting to understand why this is happening on such a large scale.</p>
<p>Well, I have heard one author say that we are dealing with “man’s ancestral hatred of women”. The subjugation of women would certainly be explained by this idea. We must ask ourselves: has it served society, humanity, and our planet for this particular theatrical theme to be repeated ad-nauseum? I think not. In fact, one thorough look at the state of our world shows how no one seems to be completely satisfied with our current reality. In fact, even the wealthy seem to be trapped in a state of subconscious and insatiable need. One need only to look at the various forms of addiction that exist in our world to see this is the case. The proliferation of war, poverty, and disease shows us that the current locus of societal control is not where it should be. The number of people who have so-called mental illnesses is staggering these days. Could this be a byproduct of the imbalance perpetuated by this programming? Perhaps if a more natural order was allowed to develop in human society, then we might see a better world, whereby everyone can be satisfied and live in harmony with one another. Instead, most of us are being programmed by these stereotypes and archetypes that seem to have become the hallmark of an unnatural system, bent on usurping the power of others, both male and female.</p>
<p>Programming allows for no individual development, forces people into predefined roles, and removes a measure of freewill. It also makes people more predictable and therefore easier to control. However, since it is done on such a <b>subconscious</b> level, most people do not recognize it and think that they are behaving in ways that are natural to them.</p>
<p>So is there any way out of this outdated rut of a program that we all seem to be adhering to, on some level or another? Well, one way would be if everyone stopped watching and exposing their children to these movies that reinforce these stereotypical roles onto people, but I don’t see that happening anytime soon. Therefore, the only way out would be to rise above this sort of programming. However, I have noticed that when I tried to rise above this programming, it seemed to kick in even stronger, and I felt a serious backlash from males.</p>
<p>There’s one more thing I want to throw out there, considering my recent research. I have been examining a certain acronym, about which there seems to be some debate regarding what the letters stand for. After hearing of how Hitler supposedly had a mickey mouse figurine on his desk, and after recognizing the existence of something called “<b>Project Paperclip</b>”, I have to wonder now if the MK in “<b>MK Ultra</b>” actually represents the words “Magic Kingdom”. I say this because there is a huge conglomerate monster involved in manufacturing Disney-based products, and perpetuating the programming therein, and there does seem to be a form of magic being used on people through these movies, and through programming in general, which not only divides women from men, but also has a tendency to make women into adversaries of each other, ala Cinderella’s stepsisters (for one example). The concept of “divide and conquer” keeps coming up when I look at the control of the human race through programming, in all its forms. By the way, does it strike anyone as odd that there is a Disney Land in California and a Disney World in Florida?</p>
<p>With regard to what I have read about the illuminati being formed in 1776: I feel that is complete disinfo. I say this because it seems like there has always been some elite group of people controlling the majority of the populations of this world. Even when there have been good men trying to bring people out of slavery and oppression, they seem to either get coopted or killed. I hope that this state of affairs doesn’t last. It is not a healthy system, and leaves most people disturbed on a subconscious level, leading them to have some emotional issue of one form or another, often causing some form of addiction, i.e. overeating, drugs, gambling, etc. as a way of coping with an unseen form of slavery which no one is allowed to notice, much less talk about.</p>
<p>It seems to me that we are indeed living in a world where an unseen form of slavery exists- just ask any TI who has experienced “intellectual property theft” or the “<b>Truman Show effect</b>”. Also, after considering the mass programming of female children, as mentioned above, it is not surprising to find the statistic out there stating that 75% of TIs are female who possess advanced educations and/or high IQs. This fact tells me that the power and abilities of this group are being usurped by a system that wants no challenges to its programming and authority, and would apparently like the majority of women living in the world to have low IQs and less education. Seeing the potentiality of this section of the population, in advance would behoove that system to preprogram these women into a victim mentality.</p>
<p>After reading my documents, and/or watching my videos, one might have the opinion that I am a feminist. I’m really not that. I don’t know what I am. What I do know is that the system in which most of us are living is unnatural and causes more problems than it solves. The fact that, in most cultures, women are subjugated and their opinions are often discounted by men and women alike, tells me that the way females &amp; males are programmed could be a big part of the problems that are manifesting in our world today. If women were allowed to retain their natural strengths and abilities (meaning: if women weren’t programmed to be somewhat helpless and at odds with other women including their own mothers), would the world be a better place? Perhaps there would be fewer incidents of women trapping men by getting pregnant. Maybe there would be less “cattiness” exhibited between women. The only way to find out would be to try. Generally speaking, men have been in charge of the ruling organizations of this world for too long and the results have been favorable to the ruling class, and detrimental to the majority of the population, but I suspect that, on a spiritual level, it hasn’t really served either group.</p>
<p><strong>About Learned Helplessness:</strong></p>
<p>From <a href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1380861/learned-helplessness" rel="nofollow">http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1380861/learned-helplessness</a></p>
<p>“learned helplessness, in psychology, a mental state in which an organism forced to bear aversive stimuli, or stimuli that are painful or otherwise unpleasant, becomes unable or unwilling to avoid subsequent encounters with those stimuli, even if they are “escapable,” presumably because it has learned that it cannot control the situation.</p>
<p>The theory of learned helplessness was conceptualized and developed by American psychologist Martin E.P. Seligman at the University of Pennsylvania in the late 1960s and ’70s. While conducting experimental research on classical conditioning, Seligman inadvertently discovered that dogs that had received unavoidable electric shocks failed to take action in subsequent situations—even those in which escape or avoidance was in fact possible—whereas dogs that had not received the unavoidable shocks immediately took action in subsequent situations. The experiment was replicated with human subjects (using loud noise as opposed to electric shocks), yielding similar results. Seligman coined the term learned helplessness to describe the expectation that outcomes are uncontrollable.</p>
<p>Learned helplessness has since become a basic principle of behavioral theory, demonstrating that prior learning can result in a drastic change in behaviour and seeking to explain why individuals may accept and remain passive in negative situations despite their clear ability to change them. In his book Helplessness (1975), Seligman argued that, as a result of these negative expectations, other consequences may accompany the inability or unwillingness to act, including low self-esteem, chronic failure, sadness, and physical illness. The theory of learned helplessness also has been applied to many conditions and behaviours, including clinical depression, aging, domestic violence, poverty, discrimination, parenting, academic achievement, drug abuse, and alcoholism.”</p>

<p>Psychiatrist Carl Gustave Jung described the <strong>archetypes</strong> as models of people, behaviors, or personalities that exist in the collective unconscious. <strong>Transference</strong> is the projection of unconscious contents.</p>
<p>It is often said that <strong>a child&#8217;s mind is like a sponge</strong>.</p>
<p>It is my argument that these movies program females into the embodying the negative female stereotypes, such as: being catty, high maintenance princess-types who generally dislike or distrust their mothers. This is all <strong>subconscious</strong>, of course, &amp; most females will not admit to this being an issue.</p>
<p>As you can see, these stories have been around much longer than the Disney films in some form or another. This is how I feel many of these roles became archetypes in the first place. However, Disney in particular, seemed to have some interest in making the adult female role the antihero. Here are some of the Disney Princess movies that contain the archetypes of “princess”, “hero/prince”, and “evil queen”, and where they came from (skip past these, if you are already familiar with the background info):</p>
<p><strong>Rapunzel</strong>, a tale with similarities to a Persian tale from the 10th century AD called “Rudaba”, was published by the Brothers Grimm in 1812, which then became the basis for the Disney movie “Tangled”.<br />
<strong>The Little Mermaid</strong>, published in 1837 by Hans Christian Anderson, became the Disney animated film of the same name in 1989.<br />
<strong>Sleeping Beauty</strong>, taken from an original story called, “The Beauty sleeping in the wood”, by Charles Perrault, published in 1697, was made into the Disney animated film, 1959.<br />
<strong>Snow White</strong>, taken from an original story by the Brothers Grimm, in 1812, but completed in 1857, was made into the animated Disney film in 1937.<br />
<strong>Cinderella</strong>, taken from an original story by Charles Perrault, published in 1697, was later published by the Brothers Grimm in 1812, and made into a Disney animated film in 1950. However, there are earlier versions of this theme, in fables complete with slipper motif, going as far back as the 1st century BCE.</p>
<p><strong>The Set Up:</strong></p>
<p><em>Cinderella</em> was originally a story about unjust oppression with a reward at the end, and is possibly derived from an original Greek tale called <em>Rhodopis</em>, which contains no evil queen or wicked stepmother. The first version I could find with a wicked stepmother in it is a Chinese tale from 860 AD, called <em>Ye Xian</em> (Yeh Shen). The Disney movie Cinderella has the female antihero in its version, as does <em>Snow White</em>, <em>Sleeping Beauty</em>, <em>The Little Mermaid</em>, and <em>Tangled</em> (taken from <em>Rapunzel</em>). It is my opinion that these particular Disney movies actually serve to disempower women in general, although some of them do show assertive princesses. The repetition of the theme of the oppressed princess (daughter role), trapped by some rendition of the evil queen (mother role), but who ultimately gets rescued by a dashing prince (hero/lover role) does a gross disservice to women in general. By creating a set of unnatural archetypes based on roles from these stories, these roles subconsciously become projected onto people by the little girl (or adult woman who grew up with these stories).</p>
<p>Today’s little girl is more prone to the programming behind these movies, since they are inundated with the movies, DVDs, books, video <a href="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/princesscanopybed.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="872" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/02/25/archetypaltransferencedisneyprincessmovies/princesscanopybed/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/princesscanopybed.jpg" data-orig-size="160,143" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="PrincessCanopyBed" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/princesscanopybed.jpg?w=160" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/princesscanopybed.jpg?w=160" class="alignright size-full wp-image-872" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/princesscanopybed.jpg?w=540" alt="PrincessCanopyBed" srcset="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/princesscanopybed.jpg 160w, https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/princesscanopybed.jpg?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 160px) 100vw, 160px"   /></a>games, baby dolls, Barbie dolls, coloring books, figurines, room décor, outfits, etc., which all serve to reinforce the “princess” role in the child’s mind, before she has any defenses against such programming. By being exposed to these movies, over and over again (because of the advent of DVDs), and at such a young age (sometimes from birth), this programming is even harder to resist. It is often said that a child’s mind is like a sponge. Since the programming comes through on a subconscious level, the child’s open mind has no filtering mechanism to avoid being programmed. I would be remiss if I didn’t note that the extent to which a child is programmed by these stories may be directly related to the amount of trauma she has received in early childhood.</p>

In the animal kingdom, baby animals instinctively trust their mother, because the mother usually has an instinct to protect her young. Humans have these instincts as well, but they are subverted by programming inherent in these movies, among other things. By subconsciously identifying with the oppressed princess, the human daughter is subconsciously projecting the role of evil queen onto her mother (or other prominent female caregiver) who then becomes the antihero to the princess. In this way, the mother has become the enemy in her daughter’s eyes, albeit on a subconscious level. It is simple psychology.</p>
<p><strong>Anecdotal Evidence: </strong></p>
<p>I have witnessed this effect in my life, my adoptive mother’s life, and in my daughter’s life. Looking back, I know I projected the evil queen <a href="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/sleepingbeautysavedbyprince.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="876" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/02/25/archetypaltransferencedisneyprincessmovies/sleepingbeautysavedbyprince/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/sleepingbeautysavedbyprince.jpg" data-orig-size="160,119" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="SleepingBeautySavedByPrince" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/sleepingbeautysavedbyprince.jpg?w=160" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/sleepingbeautysavedbyprince.jpg?w=160" class="alignright size-full wp-image-876" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/sleepingbeautysavedbyprince.jpg?w=540" alt="SleepingBeautySavedByPrince" srcset="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/sleepingbeautysavedbyprince.jpg 160w, https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/sleepingbeautysavedbyprince.jpg?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 160px) 100vw, 160px"   /></a>role onto my mother, but did she subconsciously accept that role to a degree? In my mother’s case, she was indeed “rescued” from her family by her so-called “prince”, but it eventually didn’t work out, and they got a divorce, probably because of unrealistic expectations programmed into my mother’s psyche (a Greek word for &#8220;spirit&#8221;). I have to wonder if the woman who unknowingly identifies with the princess role as a child, subconsciously accepts the evil queen role when she enters motherhood, simply because it is the most prominent adult female archetype in movies that programmed her as a child. Could that be part of what happened to my mother (in addition to other forms of archetypal transference), and why I was verbally abused and neglected when I was growing up? My mother was also a narcissist, as are the evil queens/wicked stepmothers in the Disney princess movies, and I spent half of my childhood in a literal “house of mirrors”. Could that have come from the programming from these films? In my daughter’s case, I can see how she has internalized these archetypes, because she certainly acts like a little princess and often treats me as if I were the evil queen. I, however, refuse to accept that role. I love my child and have the natural instinct to protect my child. I projected the Huntsman role from Snow White onto my father, and as such, I put him up on a pedestal, even though he was rarely present in my childhood.</p>
<p>I now have to wonder if the programming from these princess movies is the root cause of why little girls seem to fight their mothers about things that are good for them, such as the way my daughter fights me when I tell her to brush her teeth, eat better foods, do her homework, take a bath, etc. While of course children want to play rather than do homework, would they be more <a href="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/lisahomerpipie.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="866" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/02/25/archetypaltransferencedisneyprincessmovies/lisahomerpipie/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/lisahomerpipie.jpg" data-orig-size="160,115" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="LisaHomerPiPie" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/lisahomerpipie.jpg?w=160" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/lisahomerpipie.jpg?w=160" class="alignright size-full wp-image-866" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/lisahomerpipie.jpg?w=540" alt="LisaHomerPiPie" srcset="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/lisahomerpipie.jpg 160w, https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/lisahomerpipie.jpg?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 160px) 100vw, 160px"   /></a>apt to follow parents’ instructions if they weren’t watching movies and TV shows that make the parents look either like an enemy or unintelligent? In the case of little girls, these princess movies are the biggest suspect, but in the case of little boys, you can simply take a look at television shows such as The Simpsons, which paint the father in a negative light, and make the children out to be smarter than their parents. If you are programmed by these shows to think that you are smarter than your parents, are you going to trust their advice?</p>
<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<p>I have been asked why someone would want to do this. There are a few reasons that I can think of:</p>
<p><a href="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/tangledsexsubliminal.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="856" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/02/25/archetypaltransferencedisneyprincessmovies/tangledsexsubliminal/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/tangledsexsubliminal.jpg" data-orig-size="134,160" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="TangledSexSubliminal" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/tangledsexsubliminal.jpg?w=134" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/tangledsexsubliminal.jpg?w=134" class="size-full wp-image-856 alignleft" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/tangledsexsubliminal.jpg?w=540" alt="TangledSexSubliminal"   /></a>First, you have to <em>follow the money</em>. It is a multimillion (if not billion) dollar industry, aimed at little girls. Princesses are royalty. What do we know about royalty? They have a whole lot of money and stuff. If you can get those children to identify with the princess role, then you can trigger this programming in media, which can then open them up to new programming in your movies, music, television, and advertisements, thereby making them into good little consumers who will buy, or get their parents to buy, anything you make them want. This is done simultaneously with the sexual subliminal messages found in many Disney films, if not all of them, which then brings the child’s subconscious mind to focus on sex (and on baser desires in general), programming which will be played out later, as the child reaches puberty. While the adage “<em>sex sells</em>” is often used in advertising, that is only one reason for <em>sexual subliminals</em>. By focusing children’s subconscious mind on sex, after already setting up the atmosphere of mistrust between parents and children, they will further stray from their parents’ advice, and it will be harder for them to focus on learning, spirituality, or finding a career.</p>
<p>The little girl who subconsciously identified with the “<em>oppressed princess</em>” role will project the “hero/prince” role onto any boyfriends she has as she gets older. However, these males were not programmed by these movies, and thus don’t fit that role very well. In fact, any boyfriend or husband to the female, who subconsciously identified with the princess role, will most likely grow to resent this woman and complain that she is too “<em>high maintenance</em>”. Well, duh, <em>she’s been programmed to be that way</em>! This sets a girl up for a big disappointment that occurs in the unconscious mind when she subconsciously recognizes that her mate can never fulfill the role of “hero/prince”. This will cause a form of cognitive dissonance that the grown woman will not be able to identify, and thus, she will not be able to address or resolve the issue at heart, if she seeks psychological help. The end result of all of this unrealistic programming is depression, among other mental health issues.</p>
<p>If you can get children to mistrust their parents (especially on a subconscious level they cannot recognize), this makes it easier to program them using the media. By the way, this subconscious programming of little children to mistrust their parents is reinforced when they realize the parents have been lying to them about Santa, the Easter Bunny, and the Tooth fairy. Again, this happens on a subconscious level, which makes it all the more insidious and difficult to correct, once the damage has been done. It is easier to program a person who lacks foundational values. This is accomplished as a result of the child being somewhat cut-off from a parent’s protective instinct due to the subconscious lack of trust caused by these movies, as well as certain TV shows. How does one deprogram a child that has had the princess programming reinforced throughout their childhood via the umpteen million Disney princess products on the market (mentioned above)? If a parent tries to raise awareness about the issue to the child, the child is not going to admit that they identify with the Disney princess, or Bart or Lisa Simpson for that matter, because it is not in the conscious mind.<strong> The fact that it is done on a subconscious level is what makes it work so well. People quickly deny it is real precisely because they are unconscious of it.</strong></p>
<p>With these programs in the subconscious mind, triggers can be used to bring this<em> programming</em> to bear in multiple ways. Take the shopping addict for example. Could that be a subconscious reaction to princess programming? How about addiction in general? What about hoarding? Overeating or eating disorders? I already mentioned depression. These mental health issues support an industry already in place: Psychiatric medicine, i.e. pharmaceutical drugs. I feel that many disorders that people suffer are caused by programming, to keep a whole industry running, thereby making a small portion of the population very wealthy from other people’s suffering, without actually curing anything. The only real way to cure some of these issues, in my opinion, is with deprogramming. Most psychiatrists and psychologists out there barely even admit programming exists, much less want to cure it. One begins to see a vicious cycle going on with all of this.</p>
<p>Is it any wonder that Hitler is said to have had a Mickey Mouse figurine on his desk?<a href="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/priestwitherection.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="863" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/02/25/archetypaltransferencedisneyprincessmovies/priestwitherection/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/priestwitherection.jpg" data-orig-size="160,103" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="PriestWithErection" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/priestwitherection.jpg?w=160" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/priestwitherection.jpg?w=160" class="alignright size-full wp-image-863" style="width:184px;height:136px;" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/priestwitherection.jpg?w=540" alt="PriestWithErection" srcset="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/priestwitherection.jpg 160w, https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/priestwitherection.jpg?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 160px) 100vw, 160px"   /></a></p>
<p>So, if you are a mother with a young daughter, and if you decide to expose your little girl to these movies, I ask you to offer parental guidance with these princess movies. I feel that any movie showing a priest getting an erection during a wedding should not be rated G. I don’t buy the story that it is actually the priest’s knees because the erection scene is one lump, not two. Once that initial subconscious separation between mother and daughter is made, then the little girl is directed to follow her <strong>over-sexualized Disney role models</strong>, such as Brittny Spears &amp; Miley Cyrus.</p>
<p>Of course, the extent to which all mind control works on the psyche is dependent on variables in the individual subject&#8217;s life, like how much early childhood trauma they might have had, or whether their parents made any effort to instill values into them, for two examples.</p>

While there are many different forms of mind control programming, including, but not limited to, movies, music, tell-a-vision, the use of implants, and even the manipulation of language (which I have discussed in another document), this paper will focus on the astrological and tarot archetypes and their impact on the human <b>psyche</b>. Keep in mind that the word “psyche” comes from a Greek word for “spirit”, thus mind control does indeed affect the spirit.</p>
<p>In this document, I refer to a concept known as <b>archetypal transference </b>as a form of metaphysical programming because it seems to act on a metaphysical level, as opposed to programming through movies and such, which occur on a physical level, although both forms of programming ultimately affect the psyche. Psychiatrist Carl Gustave Jung described archetypes as “models of people, behaviors or personalities” that exist “in the collective unconscious” (1). Transference is the projection of unconscious contents. I am using the term, “archetypal transference”, to refer to the process by which tarot and astrological archetypes are inserted into the collective unconscious, and are then projected onto people based on their numerology and birthdates. Jung referred to cultural archetypes that I see as natural (hero, lover, caregiver , etc.), whereas I am referring to archetypes that I see as unnatural and imposed on people based on their birthdates, and on the collective unconscious through the so-called “disciplines” of tarot and astrology, and their overuse in popular culture.</p>
<p>For those of you who are not familiar with these concepts, there are some references and definitions with links (for further research), at the bottom of this paper. However, I ask you to please read through this document before following the links and getting lost on the internet. 🙂</p>
<p>There is a set of <b>archetypes</b>, in<b> tarot</b> and <b>astrology</b>, which seem to be a type of <b>metaphysical mind control</b>. It is done on a level that is less detectable than the more commonly known forms of mind control, since these particular archetypes have been around for centuries, in the case of tarot (1), and for millennia, in the case of astrology (2). While these archetypes may be hard for some to recognize, regarding how they relate to the “butterfly effect”, please bear with me. These archetypes refer to the “butterfly effect” in that they are initial conditions existing in the collective unconscious that have specific results. Since they have been around for so long, much longer than you or I have been alive, they have become <strong>memes</strong>. One begins to wonder if these archetypes were made to illustrate an existing pattern, if they were made to influence people’s natures  in an unnatural way, or if it’s a little of both. Even if they were created innocently (without a negative intent), I still do feel they have an impact on the collective psyche of humanity, with regards to <b>freewill</b>.</p>
<p><b>My Theory is based on Research, Observation, and Personal Experience:</b></p>
<p>The way “law of attraction” is supposed to work is that, focusing on or repeating a certain idea or desire will bring that idea or desire to fruition. The “butterfly effect” refers to the idea that something seemingly small can have a big impact on something else, for example, that a butterfly flapping its wings in Japan could cause a hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean. Both of these theories, which seem to have some validity, combine to make a big mess where the archetypes of <b>tarot</b> and <b>astrology</b> are concerned. These <b>archetypes</b> are assigned to people based on their birthdates, and also sometimes based on numerology, and thus become the “initial conditions” referred to in the “butterfly effect” (see definition below). There are over 1,200 decks of tarot cards in circulation today (3), and they have been printed and reprinted an untold number of times, which, according to the law of attraction, amplifies the vibration of those archetypes. In the meantime, more and more people have been studying these two disciplines in the past 50 years especially, and/or have been getting readings done for them by other people. As more people are exposed to these archetypes, the <b>collective unconscious</b> is increasingly affected by them, in the form of <b>memes</b>. It is the repetition of a pattern that amplifies its vibration, and produces results specific to that pattern. With all these decks out there, and all their subsequent printings, these energies are amplified.</p>
<p>The only way to bring any true freewill back into this world is to abolish the archetypes. I do not say this lightly. By tying someone’s birthdate to the astrology signs and tarot correspondences, freewill is severely restricted, causing people to <i>generally</i> behave in predetermined ways, based on these archetypes. So with astrology, we end up with scorpios being passionate, but also kind of mean, virgos being intelligent and analytical, but sometimes over-critical, aries being assertive, but sometimes pushy, and leos being glamorous, hogs for attention.</p>
<p>The fact that most people in our society seem to fit most of the main character traits for their star signs, whether they believe in astrology or not, shows that these archetypes have been inserted into the collective unconscious, in the form of memes, via archetypal transference, and unbeknownst to the individual. This removes a measure of freewill, causing people to be stuck in cookie cutter personality traits and life patterns.  Astrology has been around for millennia, and has had its impact accordingly. The tarot has only been around for centuries, but has become so popular in recent decades, that it seems to have caused the collective unconscious to become infected with these memes, which are a whole different set of predetermined archetypes. This then further restricts freewill, again based on one’s birthdate.</p>

For example, my mother was born on 4/4, her corresponding trump card was the Emperor, and she displayed the characteristics of the 4<sup>th</sup> trump, most notably from the so-called, Crowley-Thoth deck. The symbols in that card represented the main characters in her life, one example being the two rams behind the seated figure, representing two aries who supported my mother during her life, my father on the left, and maternal grandmother (deceased) on the right. Aliester Crowley was a known Satanist, who is said to have also been an MI6 agent. Frieda Harris painted the deck under his instruction. Did he have an ulterior motive for this deck? Was he putting this energy out there on purpose to affect reality? When I saw this card, in relation to my mother’s 4/4 birthdate, and recognized the significance of that card’s symbols in her life, I began to wonder if my own life was influenced in a similar way, given my double digit birthdate.</p>
<p>Once I began to examine my own life in relation to the tarot, based on my having a 12/12 birthdate, I could not deny that the 12th trump archetype of <a href="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpthoth.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-221" style="width:125px;height:179px;" alt="12th Trump from the Thoth Tarot Deck" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpthoth.jpg?w=540" srcset="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpthoth.jpg 184w, https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpthoth.jpg?w=102 102w" sizes="(max-width: 184px) 100vw, 184px"   /></a>The Hanged Man, which is an upside-down/reversed figure, had a very significant impact on my development, <i>long before I ever knew the tarot or astrology even existed</i>. Also, please notice how there is an upside-down <b>ankh </b>in this card, which is the Egyptian hieroglyph for “life”. What might that imply? Given the idea of the butterfly effect of these cards being printed over and over again, what might that upside-down ankh ultimately influence in these years surrounding 2012, since it is on the 12<sup>th</sup> trump card? How would it influence the life of a human being, who is unknowingly tied to that card? Could these things have anything to do with how absurd things seem in our world lately with the gross violations of human rights that continues to be perpetrated on <b>nonconsensual human experimentees</b>, and on those who call themselves “<b>targeted individuals</b>”? Could the upside-down and reversed nature of this card have had anything to do with certain unjust things happening in our world today, such as the couple getting arrested for rescuing a baby deer (4)?</p>

So, not wanting to be evil, I endeavored to learn how to write with the right hand. Given the whole left-brain, right-brain concept, which possibly evolved from studies of stroke victims, showing that stroke in the right hemisphere of the brain affects something on the left side of the body, and vice a versa (but I digress), I contend that changing a human being’s natural handedness changes the natural balance in the child’s brain, further subverting freewill. I know of one person, who was born on 10/20 (which carries the 12 vibration &#8211; 1020), who was also made to write right-handed even though he was originally left-inclined. Is that a coincidence?</p>
<p>Both he and I are very creative people, (I was an artist and he a musician), yet we both lack the perseverance to be able to complete creative projects. If we had been allowed to be left-handed, would we have been more successful in our creative endeavors? It is a subject I would like to see investigated. Perhaps someone should do some studies on these people who were naturally left-handed, but made to be right-handed. Maybe one of those illustrious scientists could try that instead of experimenting with brain stimulation using implants which has messed up so many people’s lives, including my own.</p>
<p>This “reverse-curse”, brings us back to the concepts of the “butterfly effect” and “law of attraction”. Causing a “butterfly effect”, the repetition of these archetypes through multiple printings of over 1200 decks, creates a metaphysical effect on the <b>psyche</b>, which in turn, causes a person to emulate these archetypes in some capacity, thereby attracting attributes of their corresponding archetypes. In my case, astrologically, my archetype is Sagittarius, but also Ophiuchus, whose feet do lie on the ecliptic. Now take a look at the 12<sup>th</sup> trump of the Crowley-Harris Thoth deck and compare it to Ophiuchus. Notice any similarities?</p>

<p>In both cases, there is a <b>serpent</b>. It either represents the so-called “<b>serpent class</b>” or the devil himself. In the 12<sup>th</sup> trump, the serpent looks as if it is sucking from the brain of the subject, in the constellation of Ophiuchus, it seems that the subject is <a href="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/deadsnake.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="758" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/01/28/mcusingarchetypaltransference/deadsnake/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/deadsnake.jpg" data-orig-size="259,194" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="deadsnake" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/deadsnake.jpg?w=259" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/deadsnake.jpg?w=259" class="size-full wp-image-758 alignright" alt="deadsnake" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/deadsnake.jpg?w=540" srcset="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/deadsnake.jpg 259w, https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/deadsnake.jpg?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 259px) 100vw, 259px"   /></a>carrying the serpent.  Either way, I see the serpent in these archetypes as a <b>parasite</b>. Hence the background image currently on my YouTube page (shown to the right). I apologize if it looks gross, and I am not an animal killer. I actually really love animals in general. In fact, I feel bad for the snake in that picture. I was just looking for an image that represented how I feel about what has been going on for far too long, in my opinion. While we’re on the subject, why is one of the symbols for America the serpent (as in “Don’t tread on me”)? Could this have been done just to conflict with the Bible, and to cause unconscious confusion and/or <strong>cognitive dissonance </strong>among Americans who happen to be Christian? Hmmm….</p>
<p>Who created these archetypes, anyway? I suspect it was someone <b>playing God</b>. Even the word “archetype” contains “arch” in it, which would be above the head. I see these particular archetypes, which are associated with birthdates, as “<b>graven images</b>” (one could say they have been engraven into the collective unconscious). They have infected the collective unconscious, and have robbed a large measure of freewill from the individual, but have also, therefore robbed that individual of the person they were originally intended to be. Without the existence of these pre-fabricated, pre-appointed, archetypal molds that were put into place centuries and even millennia, before the individual was born, the child who was originally left-handed might have remained left-handed, and the effect on her or his life would have been what the Creator originally intended by making them left-handed in the first place. If you don’t believe in a Creator, then consider that nature also intended for those left-handed children to be left-handed for a reason.</p>
<p>When I take a look at my entire life, I can’t help but wonder if my archetype is an arche-“typo”. I wonder if it is a mistake or if it was done on purpose. It’s a cruel joke, to say the least. Please also consider watching my video about “<b>Symbolism in Words and Numbers</b>” to see more detail about mind control programming, done on such a foundational level. After learning about symbolism, it becomes more obvious that there is a malevolent modus operandi found within the nature of the English language.</p>

<p>Here is an example of an archetype not specific to tarot or astrology, although it is the 11<sup>th</sup> trump in certain, more traditional tarot decks: It is the archetype of justice. Frequently, justice is referred to as being blind. Why is that? Some people say it means that justice is impartial. Well, why not just say “justice is impartial”? Since I have heard and read that phrase, “justice is blind”, often throughout my life, I wonder who came up with that idea. Even most statues depicting this archetype are of a blindfolded woman holding the scales of justice. Justice should never be blind, in my opinion. Rather, it should be able to see all aspects of a situation before rendering judgment on an individual affected by these things. If you are a victim of monarch programming, or a nonconsensual human experimentee, like myself, then you may have noticed that it has been hard to get justice for your situation. If you’re not, you may instead have noticed how the laws in the United States (with the Patriot Act, for example) are changing in ways that seem to remove the original intent of the <b>Constitution</b>, and go directly against the Pledge of Allegiance, wh<a href="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/justiceblind.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="755" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/01/28/mcusingarchetypaltransference/justiceblind/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/justiceblind.jpg" data-orig-size="106,160" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="justiceblind" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/justiceblind.jpg?w=106" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/justiceblind.jpg?w=106" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-755" alt="justiceblind" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/justiceblind.jpg?w=540"   /></a>ich claims the United States of America is “one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all”.</p>
<p>Could this be a “butterfly effect” of the frequently repeated phrase, “<b>Justice is blind</b>”? I think it’s possible. Does the archetype of “blind justice” actually serve the human population? I don’t think it does. Rather, I think “blind justice” serves the criminals who have purposefully enslaved the human population through mind control programming, not only in movies, music, and tell-a-vision, but also through the manipulation of language and archetypes.</p>
<p>Programming via TV, movies, music, and language is done to people on a physical level, meaning that it creates effects on the human mind. However, the creation of these particular archetypes, I feel, was specifically to control people on a more metaphysical level, meaning it has effects on the human spirit, making it less detectable, and therefore more insidious, than those other forms of mind control. Basically, it is what I would call, “<b>archetypal determinism</b>”, done through the projection of specific archetypes assigned by birthdate and numerology, using “the butterfly effect” of over a thousand decks, and untold printings of each, which severely restricts freewill, on an unconscious and psychological level. The “puppet” then, cannot be held responsible for the actions of some unseen “puppet master” who creates and perpetuates these archetypes. That would be akin to “blaming the victim”, a mentality that seems to be occurring on a grand scale these days. The amplification of the vibrations of these archetypes through numerous printings of so many decks becomes nothing but another form of unseen slavery, making human beings into nothing more than metaphysical guinea pigs.</p>
<p>Ah, but we are told that slavery is illegal and doesn’t exist, right? You who are nonconsensual human experimentees might realize that idea as untrue. However, when you try to mention it, you are told you’re crazy. This is known as the <b>double-bind</b> and causes conflict in the psyche, including the manifestation of schizophrenic symptoms.</p>
<p>I would like to give special thanks to Michael Gaio for his article entitled, “Archetypal Semiotic Transference”, because it helped me to see how this stuff works, how it affected me before I ever knew the tarot and astrology existed, and how it affected my mother as well. His article can be found here: <a href="http://blog.michaelgaio.com/2011/09/25/archetypal-semiotic-transference/">http://blog.michaelgaio.com/2011/09/25/archetypal-semiotic-transference/</a></p>

<p><b>Chaos theory</b> is the study of nonlinear dynamics, in which <i>seemingly random</i> events are actually predictable from simple deterministic equations.</p>
<p>-From <a href="http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/chaos-theory">http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/chaos-theory</a></p>
<p>Chaos theory studies the behavior of dynamical systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditions, an effect which is popularly referred to as the butterfly effect. Small differences in initial conditions (such as those due to rounding errors in numerical computation) yield widely diverging outcomes for such dynamical systems, rendering long-term prediction impossible in general.[1] This happens even though these systems are deterministic, meaning that their future behavior is fully determined by their initial conditions, with no random elements involved.[2] In other words, the deterministic nature of these systems does not make them predictable.</p>

<p><b>The Butterfly Effect</b> is first described by Lorenz at the December 1972 meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Washington, D.C., vividly illustrates the essential idea of chaos theory. In a 1963 paper for the New York Academy of Sciences, Lorenz had quoted an unnamed meteorologist&#8217;s assertion that, if chaos theory were true, a single flap of a single seagull&#8217;s wings would be enough to change the course of all future weather systems on the earth.</p>

<p><b>The Law of Attraction</b> refers to the idea that you attract that which you focus on. The movies, “The Secret”, and “What the Bleep Do We Know”, both refer to the Law of Attraction, although “What the Bleep Do We Know” digs more deeply into ideas of Quantum Physics as they relate to the “law of attraction”. See <a href="http://www.abraham-hicks.com/">http://www.abraham-hicks.com/</a> for more information on this concept.</p>

<p><b>Memes</b> The word meme is a shortening (modeled on gene) of mimeme (from Ancient Greek μίμημα Greek pronunciation: [míːmɛːma] mīmēma, &#8220;imitated thing&#8221;, from μιμεῖσθαι mimeisthai, &#8220;to imitate&#8221;, from μῖμος mimos &#8220;mime&#8221;) and it was coined by the British evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins in The Selfish Gene (1976) as a concept for discussion of evolutionary principles in explaining the spread of ideas and cultural phenomena. Examples of memes given in the book included melodies, catch-phrases, fashion and the technology of building arches.</p>

<p><b>Archetype: </b> 1. An original model or type after which other similar things are patterned; a prototype: &#8220;&#8216;Frankenstein&#8217; . . . &#8216;Dracula&#8217; . . . &#8216;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&#8217; . . . the archetypes that have influenced all subsequent horror stories&#8221; (New York Times).</p>
<p>2. An ideal example of a type; quintessence: an archetype of the successful entrepreneur.</p>
<p>3. In Jungian psychology, an inherited pattern of thought or symbolic imagery derived from the past collective experience and present in the individual unconscious.</p>

<p><b>Transference</b> is the projection of unconscious contents. Jung&#8217;s Studies in Word Association (1906) provided evidence for and referred to Freud&#8217;s concept of transference, published the previous year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     -From <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/transference-counter-transference-analytical-psychology">http://www.answers.com/topic/transference-counter-transference-analytical-psychology</a></p>
<p><b>Collective Consciousness</b> was a term coined by the French sociologist Émile Durkheim (1858–1917) to refer to the shared beliefs and moral attitudes which operate as a unifying force within society.[1]</p>
<p>-From <a href="http://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/collective+unconscious">http://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/collective+unconscious</a></p>
<p><b>Collective Unconscious</b> is a term of analytical psychology, coined by Carl Jung. It is proposed to be a part of the unconscious mind, expressed in humanity and all life forms with nervous systems, and describes how the structure of the psyche autonomously organizes experience. Jung distinguished the collective unconscious from the personal unconscious, in that the personal unconscious is a personal reservoir of experience unique to each individual, while the collective unconscious collects and organizes those personal experiences in a similar way with each member of a particular species.</p>
<p>For Jung, “My thesis then, is as follows: in addition to our immediate consciousness, which is of a thoroughly personal nature and which we believe to be the only empirical psyche (even if we tack on the personal unconscious as an appendix), there exists a second psychic system of a collective, universal, and impersonal nature which is identical in all individuals. This collective unconscious does not develop individually but is inherited. It consists of pre-existent forms, the archetypes, which can only become conscious secondarily and which give definite form to certain psychic contents.&#8221;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              -From <a href="http://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/Collective+consciousness">http://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/Collective+consciousness</a></p>
<p><b>Cognitive Dissonance</b> is a psychological phenomenon which refers to the discomfort felt at a discrepancy between what you already know or believe, and new information or interpretation. It therefore occurs when there is a need to accommodate new ideas, and it may be necessary for it to develop so that we become &#8220;open&#8221; to them. Neighbour (1992) makes the generation of appropriate dissonance into a major feature of tutorial (and other) teaching: he shows how to drive this kind of intellectual wedge between learners&#8217; current beliefs and &#8220;reality&#8221;.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      -From <a href="http://www.learningandteaching.info/learning/dissonance.htm">http://www.learningandteaching.info/learning/dissonance.htm</a></p>
<p>Two cognitions are said to be dissonant if one cognition follows from the opposite of another. What happens to people when they discover dissonant cognitions? The answer to this question forms the basic postulate of Festinger¹s theory. A person who has dissonant or discrepant cognitions is said to be in a state of psychological dissonance, which is experienced as unpleasant psychological tension. This tension state has drivelike properties that are much like those of hunger and thirst. When a person has been deprived of food for several hours, he/she experiences unpleasant tension and is driven to reduce the unpleasant tension state that results. Reducing the psychological sate of dissonance is not as simple as eating or drinking however.</p>
<p>To understand the alternatives open to an individual in a state of dissonance, we must first understand the factors that affect the magnitude of dissonance arousal. First, in its simplest form, dissonance increases as the degree of discrepancy among cognitions increases. Second, dissonance increases as the number of discrepant cognitions increases. Third, dissonance is inversely proportional to the number of consonant cognitions held by an individual. Fourth, the relative weights given to the consonant and dissonant cognitions may be adjusted by their importance in the mind of the individual.</p>
<p>-From <a href="http://www.ithaca.edu/faculty/stephens/cdback.html">http://www.ithaca.edu/faculty/stephens/cdback.html</a></p>
<p>Cognitive dissonance refers to a situation involving conflicting attitudes, beliefs or behaviors. This produces a feeling of discomfort leading to an alteration in one of the attitudes, beliefs or behaviors to reduce the discomfort and restore balance etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     -From <a href="http://www.simplypsychology.org/cognitive-dissonance.html">http://www.simplypsychology.org/cognitive-dissonance.html</a></p>
<p>I contend that cognitive dissonance can occur on both conscious and unconscious levels.</p>
<p><b>Double-bind:</b> Bateson et al. suggest that a person caught in a &#8220;double bind&#8221; &#8212; a situation in which no matter what a person does, he &#8220;can&#8217;t win&#8221; &#8212; may develop schizophrenic symptoms. In the double bind there are two conflicting levels of communication and an injunction against commenting on the conflict. –From <a href="http://laingsociety.org/cetera/pguillaume.htm">http://laingsociety.org/cetera/pguillaume.htm</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are familiar with concepts such as: “<b>the butterfly effect</b>”, “<b>chaos theory</b>”, &amp; “<b>the law of attraction</b>”, and/or you understand the ideas behind movies such as “<b>What the Bleep Do We Know</b>?” (which talks a bit about <b>Quantum Mechanics</b>), &amp; “<b>The Secret</b>”, then I feel you may have a better understanding of how I came to the following theory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>My Theory:</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The way “law of attraction” is supposed to work is that, focusing on or repeating a certain idea or desire will bring that idea or desire to fruition. The “butterfly effect” is the theory that something seemingly small can have a big impact on something else. Both of these theories combine to make a big mess where <b>tarot</b> and <b>astrology</b> archetypes are concerned. These <b>archetypes</b> have been printed and reprinted an uncountable number of times, which, according to the butterfly effect and law of attraction, amplifies the vibration of those archetypes. In the meantime, more and more people end up studying these two disciplines, or at least getting readings done for them by other people. Every day, more and more people are exposed to these archetypes, and, as they are, the collective consciousness is increasingly affected by them. It is the repetition of a pattern that amplifies its vibration, and produces results specific to that pattern.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only way to bring true goodness back into this world is to abolish the archetypes. I do not say this lightly. By tying someone’s birthdate to the astrology signs and tarot correspondences, freewill is severely restricted, causing people to generally behave in predetermined ways, based on these archetypes. So with astrology, we end up with scorpios being kind of mean, virgos being “know-it-all’s” (as I heard one virgo tell me), aries being rather hard-headed, and leos being hogs for attention. With the tarot, we end up with people born on double digits, displaying characteristics from various cards, but especially the trumps: for example, my mother was born on 4/4 and her corresponding trump card was the Emperor, and she displayed the characteristics of that card, and the symbolisms in that card were the main characters in her life. In my mother’s case the specific deck was the Crowley-Harris Thoth deck. Crowley was a known Satanist, who is said to have also been an MI6 agent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fact that most people in our society seem to fit most of the character traits of their star signs, whether they believe in astrology or not, means that these archetypes have been inserted into the collective consciousness, via <b>archetypal transference</b>, unbeknownst to the individual. This removes a measure of freewill, causing people to be stuck in cookie cutter personality traits and life patterns.  The fact that the tarot has become so popular in recent decades, has also caused the <b>collective consciousness</b> to be infected with a whole different set of predetermined archetypes, which then  removes an additional portion of freewill, again based on one’s birthdate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before I could come to this conclusion about the impact of tarot and astrology archetypes on the collective and individual consciousnesses, I had to examine my life in relation to my numerology and its connection to the trumps of the tarot. Once I did that, based on my having a double digit birthdate, I could not deny that the archetype of the tarot trump corresponding to that date, had a very significant impact on my development, long before I even knew the tarot or astrology even existed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Who created these archetypes, anyway? I suspect it was someone <b>playing God</b>. Remove the archetypes and freewill may be restored. I see the archetypes, which are associated with birthdates, as “<b>graven images</b>” that became <b>memes</b> that have infected the collective consciousness, and have robbed freewill from the individual, but also, therefore, the person they were originally intended to be without these predestined, pre-fabricated, pre-appointed archetypal molds that were put into place centuries before the individual was born.</p>
