		<h3 class="result"><a href="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/02/05/judged-in-absentia/" rel="bookmark">Judged In Absentia</a></h3>					<p>After being reminded of a website by fellow WordPress author, lissakr11humanelife, I decided to take another look at it, since it talks about the technical possibilities of this nightmare called “<b>stalking by proxy</b>” or “the program”.</p>
<p>The author of this website (<a href="http://www.dataasylum.com">www.dataasylum.com</a>) talks about how the so-called “targeted individual” has been judged by some unseen entity (or entities), which is why the target is in this sick “<b>program</b>”. What he doesn’t mention is the fact that through other forms of <b>mind control</b>, such as movies, music, television, and the manipulation of language, the targeted individual has been set up in the first place, since birth, in most cases. If you are a <b>targeted individual</b>, you might consider the possibility that you might have always been a <b>nonconsensual human experimentee</b>.</p>
<p>Being railroaded into making a false confession when I was 17 years old, by police officers who were not interested in finding out the truth but were only interested in closing the case quickly, should have clued me in on what kind of a system I am living in, a long time ago. I guess I just didn’t want to believe that, after what I was taught about this country regarding the whole “liberty and justice for all” concept. Sadly, the ideal of true<b> justice</b> has indeed become a <b>simulacrum</b> that I have only been able to find in a clothing line.</p>
<p>I must reiterate the fact that many people, including myself, after looking back over their lives, see how they seem to have been set up in the first place, and that their lives seem to have been <b>orchestrated</b>. In retrospect, I now see how my actions have been merely reactions to a negative set of circumstances, involving <b>trauma</b>, neglect, verbal abuse, physical abuse, within my family as well as from outsiders, such as teachers, doctors, and police officers. In my case, I was living with very little freewill, as I suspect are many people who have grown up under similar circumstances.</p>
<p>On the website referred to above, the author states that the targeted individual is “<b>judged in absentia</b>”, meaning that the target has no way of defending against this nasty procedure, since every negative action in their life is most likely <strong>taken out of context</strong>, by unseen accusers. Given the fact that mind control has been around much longer than anyone seems to realize (for millennia since Pharonic Egyptians were doing it for cryin’ out loud!), it becomes difficult to avoid the possibility that people who are judged as guilty by this weird program, were most likely pushed via mind control into being the person they find themselves currently judged for being.</p>
<p>Most of you who read my work, know that I am a victim of<b> implantation without consent</b>.  You may also know about the various forms of mind control programming without the use of implants, as mentioned above. So I find myself asking this question over and over again: How can anyone blame a puppet for what some unseen puppet master is responsible for?</p>
<p>Okay, so let me state, for the record, that I am not committing any crimes, although I <i>used to be</i> a drug addict. Well, it’s no wonder when you consider the circumstances I grew up in! I was separated from my natural mother at birth and kept in a hospital with no real bonding between me and my adoptive parents for the first 6 weeks of life, had a near drowning at the age of 3, was verbally abused throughout my childhood (unless I was left alone with the TV as my main babysitter), allowed to see movies such as The Omen and The Exorcist at age 7, allowed to play in the woods alone at 6 &amp; 7 years old, had another near drowning at the age of 12, spent half my childhood in a house of mirrors (even the wallpaper, coffee table, switch plates &amp; outlet covers were all mirrored!), made to sell hotdogs at construction sites in a bikini when I was 14, raped at 16 by a 21 year old man, forced into a false confession at 17, and there’s more, but I don’t want to go into it right now. Suffice it to say I had no <b>foundational values</b> instilled in me by my family, and I pretty much espoused my boyfriends’ beliefs, since I had no <b>father figure</b>. It is a miracle that I ended up a nonviolent person. Heck, it is a miracle that I didn’t wind up being a serial killer! Beyond that, it is a miracle that I am no longer a drug addict, considering the fact that I have been in horrible pain for the past 4.5 years.</p>
<p>Yet, I find myself being judged by some unknown force, who is either not considering the above mentioned facts (and much more) of my life, or who already knows it might have been orchestrated in the first place. Either way, I feel like a<b> scapegoat</b> (ironic, considering the placement of my implants).</p>
<p>I know that my whole life has been like a reaction to my circumstances of abuse, neglect, mind control, etc. That means I never truly had freewill. So what does that bode for all of us? Well, one thing is for sure &#8211; it means those of us who have been under mind control, to believe some sort of false reality, cannot be held liable for our reactions to that false reality, in my opinion, anyway.</p>
<p>Peace All.</p>

<p><b>Mind Control Using Symbolism in Words and Numbers:</b></p>
<p>There are many methods of <em>mind control</em> that have been uncovered. As most of you know, there is <em>symbolism</em> and <em>subliminals</em> used in movies, music, and television; there are also high tech forms of mind control, using <em>implants</em> (nano or otherwise) and other technologies; there is mind control involving the use of <em>trauma</em> to mess with the human being’s psychology; and then there is the manipulation of language. While the technology I have researched seems to be completely plausible, I am taking a look at language now, because it has been around much longer than the technology currently in use has been, and has a wider scope of impact.</p>
<p><em>Language</em>, including words, names, phrases, and slang, seems to contain a disproportionate amount of <em>negative symbolism</em> (considering many root words), and it can even sometimes be confusing, albeit on a level that is hard to discern. This creates a subconscious and subtle base layer of confusion which then sets the stage for general mind control using other technologies, like movies, music, and television, for example.</p>
<p>Because symbolism bypasses the conscious mind and goes straight into the <em>subconscious</em>, it is a type of programming, especially when used in language, which is learned during the most impressionable years of a child’s life.</p>
<p><b>Here are some words &amp; numbers that should be looked at symbolically, given the way symbolism affects the human psyche: </b></p>
<p>As I&#8217;ve noted in other documents, the word &#8220;<em>psyche</em>&#8221; is a Greek word denoting the <em>spirit</em>, which speaks volumes in itself. So <em>psychology</em>, then, is really the study of the spirit.</p>
<p>Century and Millennia: “cent” means 100, thus a century = 100 years. “Mill” refers to 1000,000, but a millennia = 1000 years (not a million years). Like the way certain months are not in line with their numbering, I contend that things like this can throw the mind out of balance, in a subconscious way, thus making it easier for a person to be programmed by the above mentioned technologies.</p>
<p>Therapist = “the rapist”, which I had picked up many years ago, from a movie called, “Girl Interrupted” (Angelina Jolie’s character says it).</p>
<p>Ever noticed how many names have the word “war” in them? Warburg, Warner, Warren (as in the Warren Commission), are a few. By the way, “war” is not exactly fair, is it, yet there is a term out there known as “warfare”… does this word, because of the way it sounds symbolically, make it so that more people accept war happening in our world?</p>
<p>Which brings us to the expression, “all’s fair in love and war”, but it isn’t true. However, does the prevalence of that expression in our world, subconsciously make people accept things that occur in love and war?</p>
<p>Consider how many words and names have root words like “ill”, “ow”, “mar”, “mal” or “ick” in them. Examples are Bill, Bow, Mark, Malcolm, and Trick, respectively.</p>
<p>Left vs. Right:</p>
<p>Okay, so the word “right” usually refers to the following in the English language: a direction, right handed, correct, the conservative party… phonetically, there is also rite, as in a ritual, or also right as in &#8220;human rights&#8221;, while….</p>
<p>The word “left” traditionally refers to: a direction, left as in the “liberal party”, and left as in “gone”. By the way, left-handedness is often called “south paw”… is there any symbolism there? If right means “correct”, does left symbolically mean “wrong”? Question: What happens if a person is naturally left-handed, but made to be right-handed? I ask this with the knowledge that a stroke in the left hemisphere of the brain has effects on the right side of the body &amp; vice versa. Is this how the whole left-handers are right brained, and right-handers are left brained concept was developed? If someone who is left-handed is made to be right-handed, would it take them out of their right mind, symbolically, metaphorically, metaphysically, spiritually? Some illustrious scientist ought to do a study on the effects of forcing a left-hander to be right-handed, instead of experimenting with brain implants on children from compromised groups (like adoptees). Back in the day, left handedness was considered a sign of being a witch, and meant that a person was “evil”…</p>
<p>This brings me to the word “evil”… Is Eve ill?</p>
<p>While we’re on the biblical: what about “Cain &amp; Abel”? Abel=able (as in “able-bodied”) Cain=cane (as in a tool to help a person walk)… could Cain have been disabled??? Dis Abel (dis-as in disrespect). Is this some kind of a joke? Did Cain really kill Abel? Judging by their names, it seems to me that Cain was disabled. I hope you don’t think I am blaspheming here, because I am simply searching for the truth.</p>
<p>Graven = as past participle of &#8220;grave&#8221;, meaning &#8220;fraught with danger or harm&#8221;.</p>
<p>So are graven images merely images that are fraught with danger or harm? When I look at certain trump cards of the tarot, like the Tower, the Hanged Man, and Death, for example, this seems to be the case. It also seems to be the case in the use and near worship of the crucifix that so many people are fond of. Please see my document: <a href="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2012/09/11/symbolism-mind-control-and-metaphysical-sabotage-in-relation-to-archetypal-transference-and-the-second-commandment-of-the-decalogue" rel="nofollow">https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2012/09/11/symbolism-mind-control-and-metaphysical-sabotage-in-relation-to-archetypal-transference-and-the-second-commandment-of-the-decalogue</a></p>
<p>Justice = &#8220;just us&#8221; (from Jordan Maxwell), but how about “just-ice”?</p>
<p>Why is justice blind anyway? Some people say that this phrase relates the idea that justice is impartial. Well, why not just say “justice is impartial”? I need her to be sighted and to see the whole truth, because I feel like I am being judged for actions or behaviors taken out of context. Why can I not get justice for the horrible things that have been done to me ever since I was taken from my mother at birth, if the United States is supposed to be about “liberty and justice for all”? Alas, the ideal of “justice” has simply become yet another simulacrum in our modern world, only to be found in a clothing line these days.</p>
<p>Government = govern= to control and ment=mind =&#8221;control of the mind&#8221; (from Michael Tsarion)</p>
<p>Horus = “Whore us”</p>
<p>Hermes = “her-me’s”</p>
<p>Masons = “Ma-sons”</p>
<p>Masturbate = “master”, as in ruler, and “bait” as in what you use to go fishing.</p>
<p>Peace = piece=a gun or (piece of?) = peas</p>
<p>Nazi = “Not see” or “Not C”</p>
<p>Frequency = Freak when c or Free Quincy?</p>
<p>Alphabet = alpha (male) bet (wager)</p>
<p>DISC= “dis” “c” (as in disrespect)</p>
<p>Curfew = &#8220;cure few&#8221;</p>
<p>Culture= &#8220;cult&#8221;ure = as in a cult, or as in a petri dish</p>
<p>Television= &#8220;tell-a-vision&#8221;</p>
<p>Metaphor = &#8220;meta&#8221; (above, beyond, before, or about); phor= &#8220;four&#8221; (4th trump of tarot is the Emperor card), so metaphor seems to favor the rulers of this world.</p>
<p>History = “his story” and Hebrews = “He brews” are easy examples of the misogynistic nature of our world.</p>
<p>Women are said to age less gracefully than men. Could the word &#8220;heritage&#8221; have something to do with that?</p>
<p>9= Nine = &#8220;nein&#8221; = &#8220;no&#8221;(from Michael Tsarion)</p>
<p>11= Eleven = El (a name of God, as in “elohim”) even (equal) eleven = 11th trump of various tarot decks (research them: in most, it means &#8220;justice&#8221;, or “strength”, while in one deck, it means &#8220;lust&#8221;). 11th sphere of cabala is supposed to represent &#8220;knowledge&#8221;, but it is often missing from the cabbalistic tree. So does 9/11 equate to &#8220;no justice&#8221;, “no strength, or &#8220;no knowledge&#8221;???? Did all those people die as blood sacrifices to empower some desire for no justice, strength, or knowledge??</p>
<p>12= tw elve as in elves.</p>
<p>Most people recognize that Santa is an anagram of satan</p>
<p>Regarding numbers, would it not throw a young psyche off balance to learn the word “oct” (as in “octagon”) means “eight”, yet October is the 10<sup>th</sup> month? How about “sept” meaning seven, even though September is the 9<sup>th</sup> month? And don’t forget November and December. “Nov” means 9, and “Dec” refers to 10 (see: “Decade”). I have heard one person say that they had added on a few months in the names of Augustus and Julius Ceasar, but that is no reason to name the last four months out of sync with the way they are numbered. Also, a natural calendar would have 13 months of 28 days each, since the word “month” refers to “moon”.</p>
<p>Music= <em>mu</em> (12th letter of greek alphabet) &amp; sic (&#8220;as intentionally so written&#8221;), and also “muse sick”. So this word, <em>sic</em>, could be symbolically felt as “12, as in intentionally so written”. As someone with a 12/12 birthdate, I cannot help but feel I have been programmed.</p>
<p>I have heard some people say &#8220;Obama nation&#8221;&#8230;  it sounds like they’re saying &#8220;abomination” or “Oh bomb a nation”.</p>
<p>So when I hear people speak about <em>freewill</em>, I beg to differ if a portion of us are affected by these negative and/or confusing things in our language. It seems to me that more often than not, people are reacting to situations or circumstances set up long before we were ever born. This kind of destroys the concept of <em>freewill</em> for me. Especially when I consider how my adoptive mother named me with the initials, “C.A.T.”, and didn&#8217;t even like cats. Could that have had something to do with the way I was mistreated and neglected when I was growing up? Then, as an up and coming art student, I met a fellow student with the last name of &#8220;Skinner&#8221;, who was able to somehow steal many of ideas and ended up ruining my career and my life. The phrase, &#8220;How many ways can you skin the cat&#8221; comes to mind. Again, I ask, is this some kind of a joke?</p>
<p>Also, I have heard it said, many times, that animals are more sensitive than people. Could this have something to do with why I had such a hard time dealing with being bullied and neglected by my adoptive parents? They would often tell me I was too sensitive. Could my being “extra sensitive” have something to do with the <em>self-fulfilling prophecy</em> of my mother calling me stupid, and saying that I would never amount to anything?</p>
<p>For those of you who think I am being blasphemous, I ask you to remember that the Bible states that God loves the truth, which is all I am trying to find and talk about. I am sadly reminded of the song, “Blasphemous Rumors”, by Depeche Mode, where they sing, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to start any blasphemous rumors, but I think that God has a sick sense of humor, and when I die, I expect to find him laughing&#8221;. Doesn’t the bible also say that the Truth shall set you free”? I sure hope so. I sure hope that God can see how all my life seems to have been lived as a reaction to a negative programming (including much more than just the language), over which I had no control.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s more to come&#8230;&#8230;.</p>

<p>We are living in a real-world rendition of the movie “Lord of the Flies”, where people are raised to believe they actually live in a democratic society that cares about justice. Well, I can assure you it is anything but. It is so close to the situation in the George Orwell movie called “1984” that it is frightening to those of you who actually care about the idea of a civilized democracy, in which people are “free”.</p>
<p>If you grew up believing that the United States of America was a “free country”, then you’ve been duped. When you try to exercise that freedom, to speak out about an injustice, or to grow a garden in your backyard, you are killed via “no-touch torture”. It seems like some victims of this &#8220;targeting&#8221; were even born into it, never having the chance to rise above this heap of mediocrity encouraged by the system through it&#8217;s narcotic of TV, music, and movies.</p>
<p>The reason we Americans were told that it was a free country was so that those of us who were made to believe it would eventually speak up about some of the atrocities we were witnessing. Then they could justify killing those of us who actually believe in human rights. It reminds me of the book, &#8220;Lord of the Flies&#8221;, where it is &#8220;kill or be killed&#8221;, and those of us who were brought up to believe it was anything other than some perverted form of &#8220;survival of the fittest&#8221; were lied to by those in power. Perpetraitors (mispelled on purpose to make a point), are willing to kill off those who stand up for ideals that we thought the U.S. embodied. Sad thing is, that it isn&#8217;t even truly a case of &#8220;survival of the fittest&#8221;, because if you are mind controlled at birth, you may actually be more fit than those in charge, they just don&#8217;t ever give you the chance to find out, which is why there is ritual abuse that causes serious trauma to a young mind, and mind control via movies, music, and tell-a-vision.</p>
<p>If people don’t stand up now against the gross violation of human rights that exists in the “soft-kill/slow-kill” arena, then we are all doomed as a nation. The only hope I retain then, is that those in power who have orchestrated this monstrosity, will eventually feed off each other, once they kill off the rest of us.</p>
<p>Even the ideal of justice doesn’t exist anymore, and frankly, I’m afraid it never did, at least not in the form a person who cares about true justice would think. Justice now exists only as a simulacrum, which no longer seems to hold any of the original meaning of the word. It started with the phrase “justice is blind”, and eventually that became so. Justice was no longer able to see the whole of a situation before rendering a decision. Now, we the people can only see justice appearing as a clothing line, which identifies it now as a simulacrum.</p>
<p>Welcome to the desert of the real.</p>
<p>For an example of why I feel that justice no longer truly exists, see the following link:</p>

		<h3 class="result"><a href="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2012/12/15/regarding-simulacra/" rel="bookmark">Regarding Simulacra</a></h3>					<p>I have recently read some excerpts from Jean Baudrillard’s “<strong>Simulacra and Simulations</strong>”. While I still have much more to read, I think I get the jist of it.</p>
<p>“Welcome to the desert of the real” is what Morpheus says to Neo in the first Matrix movie. It came from the book called &#8220;Simulacra and Simulations&#8221;, a book seen in that first part of the trilogy, and that is for sure!</p>
<p>I am struck by the amount of simulacra I see in this world.</p>
<p>For starters, there is the fact that, do to circumstances beyond my control, I am sincerely desiring justice for crimes that were done against me since I was a child. Ironically, I have recently seen many children wearing these clothes from a new fashion line called, you guessed it, “Justice”.</p>
<p>There is some debate over freewill. If you go on youtube or even just enter the term in a search page, you might find that there is a growing number of people that doubt the existence of freewill. I am one such person who feels that they never truly had freewill, due to the orchestrated nature of my life. I am disturbed by the movie known as “Free Willy”, because I now see it as a simulacra for that which was supposed to have been granted to human beings, but is seen less and less, given the laws that have been put in place over the past decade.</p>
<p>The assassinations of John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King were disturbing to say the least. It seemed that most Americans admired these two men for what they stood for. It is sad to note that what was given to the American people in exchange for these two prominent leaders was the renaming of streets in their “honor”. A street in exchange for a person, much less a leader, is anything but honorable.</p>
<p>I hear people say, &#8220;through grace alone I am saved&#8221;, and then I see this woman on tell-a-vision, who has the last name &#8220;Grace&#8221;. I meet a friend with a dog with the same name&#8230; is God playing a big hideous joke on me???</p>
<p>Do these things act, in some perverse way, as an exchange for qualities that people so desperately want to see in the world, but are severely lacking, because when people embody these ideals, they become targeted for assassination, or what is now being called “soft kill” and “slow kill”?</p>
<p>So what’s next, I wonder? Will I soon see a new makeup come out called “Truth”, a laundry detergent called “Love”? Will we be seeing streets named &#8220;Freedom&#8221; soon? How about a new hamburger called &#8220;Liberty and Justice for All&#8221;. Perhaps they already exist.</p>
<p>To those orchestrating this whole “world” of simulacra: You aughtta be hung for what you are doing to the meaning of things, and what it bodes for the whole world, while you sit in high places, laughing at the general populace, whom you herd like sheep and have controlled with music, movies and tell-a-vision. No wonder people are so messed up these days, with your “shock and awe” campaign against the peoples of this world with your wars and your false flag events, traumatizing the subconscious, and even the collective consciousness as a whole! What ever gave you the right to do these things to humanity?</p>
<p>More to come…</p>

<p>Back in the 1970s, I had this thought that perhaps everything we think we see around us isn’t quite the true reality, and that what we perceive is actually a sort of façade, put in place to keep us from seeing the whole truth about the nature of the world in which human beings exist. I thought of it kind of like a movie screen obstructing our view of the forces at work in our lives. I would later see this concept aptly illustrated in two movies: <strong><em>The Matrix</em></strong>, and <strong><em>Dark City</em></strong>.</p>
<p>The words “<strong>as above, so below</strong>” seem to illustrate this concept (below=the physical &amp; above=the metaphysical) with regards to the archetypes, including tarot, astrology, and the every day <img data-attachment-id="767" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/02/01/welcome-to-lord-of-the-flies-government-style/justiceblind-2/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/justiceblind.jpg" data-orig-size="106,160" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="justiceblind" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/justiceblind.jpg?w=106" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/justiceblind.jpg?w=106" class="alignleft size-thumbnail wp-image-767" alt="justiceblind" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/justiceblind.jpg?w=99&#038;h=150" width="99" height="150" srcset="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/justiceblind.jpg?w=99&amp;h=150 99w, https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/justiceblind.jpg 106w" sizes="(max-width: 99px) 100vw, 99px" />archetypes we are exposed to, such as the archetype of <a href="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/09/20/why-is-justice-blind/" target="_blank">justice</a>, which is a perfect example of what is happening in this world, allowing some very evil &amp; greedy people to get away with what basically amounts murder. With regards to astrology: The stars are above and we are below them. How many Leos out there are hogs for the spotlight? How many Aries out there get whatever they want? How many Libras out there think they have the right to judge others? Scorpios are known for being hurtful, and most of the ones I knew were. You often hear about Gemini’s being two-faced. If it isn’t evident on the surface how the person relates to the image of their sign, then it might relate on a deeper, perhaps metaphysical, level. It could simply be a case of what I’ve heard called, “<strong>Archetypal Transference</strong>”. What about Sagittarius? What about Ophiuchus, which has been taken out of the collective group of star signs, even though its feet lie on the ecliptic? Ophiuchus is the sign showing a person holding a serpent, and in some cases, that serpent has been broken. Why did they abolish this sign, I wonder? Could it have something to do with what is known as the <img data-attachment-id="1346" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2012/09/07/as-above-so-below-are-we-programmed-by-archetypes/bisconeserpent/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/bisconeserpent.jpg" data-orig-size="125,160" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="bisconeserpent" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/bisconeserpent.jpg?w=125" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/bisconeserpent.jpg?w=125" class="alignright size-full wp-image-1346" alt="bisconeserpent" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/bisconeserpent.jpg?w=540"   />“<strong>serpent class</strong>”, the <strong>elites</strong> who run the world? Perhaps this means that we should abolish the astrological symbols in general, in an effort to truly allow people to have<strong> freewill</strong>.</p>

<p>I do not say this lightly. Who invented astrology, and why? Well, it depends on which source you accept. It is said that the Chaldean Babylonians who first used the birth charts in relation to the zodiac based on the 12 signs, who brought it to Egypt (<a href="http://www.zodiacal.com/articles/hand/history.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.zodiacal.com/articles/hand/history.htm</a>). The first zodiac was supposedly invented by the Chinese in 2200BC. The first horoscopic zodiac that is close to what is in use today is believed to have been invented by the Greeks, also borrowing from the Chaldeans (<a href="http://www.stargazers.com/kepler1.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.stargazers.com/kepler1.html</a>). Perhaps it was an accident that the archetypes, imbedded in our subconscious, have created a basic program for people, depending on their birthdate. An “if, then” statement as in computer programming, would seem to allow for freewill, but it is my contention that it allows for very limited freewill, after a very set and detailed amount of programming has already been put in place, via the archetypes in astrology, as well as in the tarot, which has gained so much in popularity over the past few years.</p>
<p>So the question that would naturally follow is: Do the Tarot and astrology put a certain type of irresistible programming into place, since these archetypes have been around such a long time, and are embedded into our collective subconscious?</p>
<p>What if everything in this world really is like a computer simulation, like in the movie, The Matrix? I ask this because, in addition to the archetypes from the systems mentioned above, I am noticing things in our language that so closely resemble a type of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMe5Y4Hs_7c" target="_blank"><strong>programming</strong></a>, that I have to ask the question, “Are we all merely programmed entities walking around on this planet, none of us truly having freewill?” Are some of us programmed to be negative on purpose, to allow others to be positive? Are some of us programmed to be caring and deeply feeling people while others are programmed to actually hurt people? Are some of us programmed to fail, while others are programmed to succeed? While I do see there are numerous variables regarding <strong>astrology</strong>,<strong> tarot</strong>, and <strong>numerology</strong>, it does seem that we have all been programmed to a certain degree.</p>
<p>Is this what the <strong>second commandment of the Decalogue</strong> really meant, before the Bible had <img data-attachment-id="238" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2012/09/11/symbolism-mind-control-and-metaphysical-sabotage-in-relation-to-archetypal-transference-and-the-second-commandment-of-the-decalogue/12thtrumphermetictarot/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumphermetictarot.gif" data-orig-size="304,500" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="12thTrumpHermeticTarot" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumphermetictarot.gif?w=182" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumphermetictarot.gif?w=304" class="wp-image-238 alignright" alt="12th Trump from The Hermetic Tarot" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumphermetictarot.gif?w=117&#038;h=192" width="117" height="192" />been translated an unknown number of times? Could it be that these images, embedded in the collective unconscious and in the individual’s subconscious, have become “<em>engraven</em>” in our minds? Could it be that the bible was trying to grant freewill to the people, which had previously been taken away via so-called <strong><em>graven images</em></strong>? The Bible tells us that God gave us freewill, but I contend that astrology, the tarot, and even some bible stories, took it away with the use of archetypes, whether people are conscious of the effects or not.</p>
<p>One example of an over-arching archetype affecting our world shows up in the “<strong>Madonna-Whore</strong>” complex, as described by Freud, except that it not only affects men in our world. In the Christian story about Jesus and the crucifixion, we have two Mary’s: Jesus’ mother, and Mary Magdalene. Does this create a subversive and subliminal complex in women based on the meme perpetuated by this story?</p>

For example, think about the Aries you know, especially those born in the 4th month, who are thus given the Emperor card, or the Leos born in the 8th month, who are given Strength. The 5th trump of most tarot decks is called the Hierophant, and I wish I knew someone born on 5/5 (Taurus), to see what their life pattern has been. Is it correct to give so many others a position of power (4th trump) or abundance (3rd trump), and then force the 12th trump to be the Hanged Man (called the Dying God in the Thoth deck)?</p>
<p>I feel that the occultists who seem to be running the world have put very powerful programs into place via the tarot, astrology, evil magic, technology, and even our language, to make people generally  unwell, and even argumentative. It is all very symbolic. One only needs to look at words and their roots to see how they can have symbolic and subliminal effects on people, to understand that images have a similar effect which is much more subtle. For example, someone could have the name Bill, which could be seen as “Be ill”, and it might subliminally affect either those reading the name, or the one who has that name. Consider the word television that phonetically sounds like “tell-a-vision”. An example I find most interesting is the word “music”, which is broken down to two words, <a href="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/mu1.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="155" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2012/09/07/as-above-so-below-are-we-programmed-by-archetypes/mu1/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/mu1.jpg" data-orig-size="275,183" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="MU1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/mu1.jpg?w=275" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/mu1.jpg?w=275" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-155 alignright" alt="MU1" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/mu1.jpg?w=150&#038;h=99" width="150" height="99" srcset="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/mu1.jpg?w=150&amp;h=99 150w, https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/mu1.jpg 275w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" /></a><strong>Mu:</strong> the 12<sup>th</sup> letter of the Greek alphabet, and <strong>Sic:</strong> “as intentionally so written”.</p>
<p>Much programming could very easily be put into people’s minds based on their name alone, much less via tarot and astrological archetypes. For example, do people with the name “Michael” subconsciously believe that they are angels, or “of God”, and have a certain amount of power over others?  Someone who has initials that spell “dog” or “cat”, might subconsciously identify with that animal, which could create an extra sensitive nature in that person, but could also serve to <strong>dehumanize</strong> them. Identifying with an animal would be a double-edged sword, to say the least, considering that most people believe animals to be more sensitive than people. So would being named after an animal be some sort of curse, making someone have experiences that others will automatically deny, simply because they don’t experience them? <strong>It is akin to the situation of doctors in 1920 calling someone crazy because they didn’t have the right microscopes to see the disease from which their patient was suffering.</strong></p>
<p>While being outside of a room where a <a href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2014/02/26/brain-washing-social-control-programming-kill-your-television/" target="_blank">television</a> (tell-a-vision) set was on, I could hear a subliminal message being delivered, that said, “abuse her”. This was at a house where a 40 year old man and his <img data-attachment-id="927" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/07/04/mind-control-and-the-targeted-individual/tvmc/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/tvmc.jpg" data-orig-size="160,142" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="TVMC" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/tvmc.jpg?w=160" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/tvmc.jpg?w=160" class="size-thumbnail wp-image-927 alignleft" alt="TVMC" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/tvmc.jpg?w=150&#038;h=133" width="150" height="133" srcset="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/tvmc.jpg?w=150&amp;h=133 150w, https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/tvmc.jpg 160w" sizes="(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px" />86 year old mother were living. Interestingly enough, the mother often had complaints of him pinching her and pushing her (although she never told me that he hit her). I often saw cuts and bruises on this woman. Was he influenced, albeit subconsciously, to believe that because he was “of God”, simply because his name was Michael, that it was okay to push his elderly mother around? Was it somehow easier for my own mother to berate and degrade me because she and I subconsciously identified me with an animal?</p>
<p>All my life, I have felt like there was something not quite right about things in our world. It seems like I had been living under a curse of <strong>self-fulfilling prophecies</strong> and rampant <a href="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/09/29/memes-law-of-attraction-2/" target="_blank"><strong>memes</strong></a>, resulting from the amplification of the &#8220;upsidedown&#8221; hanged man archetype, through a growth in popularity of the tarot &amp; numerous printings of over 1000 different tarot decks. My parents were upper middle class, and so I was left with various nannies for the first 9 years of my life. After their divorce, my mother didn’t have to work, yet she left me alone most of the time. I’d had bad experiences with doctors, dentists, and oral surgeons. Teachers were often unfair and unkind to me. My art career, while I had received a scholarship at the school I attended, had somehow been sabotaged by other artists. For example, one artist stole my ideas, while another wrecked one of my paintings. While I always did my best at my jobs, and usually became the top performer, I was never able to climb the corporate ladder. After much considerations of astrology and the tarot, I have come to the conclusion that, in my case, these archetypes (especially that of the 12<sup>th</sup> trump of the tarot) caused a pattern in my life, over which I had no control. This issue refutes the idea of freewill as an absolute, which contradicts what most of us are told as we grow up.</p>
<p>I contend that these two supposed tools for divination do not allow for much freewill, for we all seem to be behaving within the parameters set up by these archetypes, which are in the collective consciousness. What tarot and horoscope readings denote to the reader and the querant obscure what these images do to the collective consciousness, as well as the individual mind that views them.</p>
<p>At any rate… how can anyone, who has been programmed by these archetypes, be blamed for their behavior that is a direct result of (often a reaction to) such programming? It would be interesting to do a study on people over 40, born on specific double digit birthdates, as in relation to their star sign as well as the corresponding major arcana card from the tarot, just to see how their lives had turned out.</p>
<p>I have documented my own situation with mind control programming, in relation to my birthdate (a double digit), and how it was used with the tarot to create a general curse in my life, and I have met other people with double digit birthdates who have suffered under similar circumstances.
