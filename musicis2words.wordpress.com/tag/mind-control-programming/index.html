<p>If you are familiar with concepts such as: “<b>the butterfly effect</b>”, from “<b>chaos theory</b>”, and “<b>the law of attraction</b>”, and/or you understand the ideas behind <a href="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/chaostheory.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="753" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/01/28/mcusingarchetypaltransference/chaostheory/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/chaostheory.jpg" data-orig-size="160,89" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="chaostheory" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/chaostheory.jpg?w=160" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/chaostheory.jpg?w=160" class="size-full wp-image-753 alignright" alt="chaostheory" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/chaostheory.jpg?w=540" srcset="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/chaostheory.jpg 160w, https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/chaostheory.jpg?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 160px) 100vw, 160px"   /></a>movies such as “<b>The Secret</b>”, and “<b>What the Bleep Do We Know</b>?” (which talks a bit about <b>Quantum Mechanics</b>), then I feel you may have a better understanding of how I came to the following theory, which is based on my observations, research, and personal experience. While there are many different forms of mind control programming, including, but not limited to, movies, music, tell-a-vision, the use of implants, and even the manipulation of language (which I have discussed in another document), this paper will focus on the astrological and tarot archetypes and their impact on the human <b>psyche</b>. Keep in mind that the word “psyche” comes from a Greek word for “spirit”, thus mind control does indeed affect the spirit.</p>
<p>In this document, I refer to a concept known as <b>archetypal transference </b>as a form of metaphysical programming because it seems to act on a metaphysical level, as opposed to programming through movies and such, which occur on a physical level, although both forms of programming ultimately affect the psyche. Psychiatrist Carl Gustave Jung described archetypes as “models of people, behaviors or personalities” that exist “in the collective unconscious” (1). Transference is the projection of unconscious contents. I am using the term, “archetypal transference”, to refer to the process by which tarot and astrological archetypes are inserted into the collective unconscious, and are then projected onto people based on their numerology and birthdates. Jung referred to cultural archetypes that I see as natural (hero, lover, caregiver , etc.), whereas I am referring to archetypes that I see as unnatural and imposed on people based on their birthdates, and on the collective unconscious through the so-called “disciplines” of tarot and astrology, and their overuse in popular culture.</p>
<p>For those of you who are not familiar with these concepts, there are some references and definitions with links (for further research), at the bottom of this paper. However, I ask you to please read through this document before following the links and getting lost on the internet. 🙂</p>
<p>There is a set of <b>archetypes</b>, in<b> tarot</b> and <b>astrology</b>, which seem to be a type of <b>metaphysical mind control</b>. It is done on a level that is less detectable than the more commonly known forms of mind control, since these particular archetypes have been around for centuries, in the case of tarot (1), and for millennia, in the case of astrology (2). While these archetypes may be hard for some to recognize, regarding how they relate to the “butterfly effect”, please bear with me. These archetypes refer to the “butterfly effect” in that they are initial conditions existing in the collective unconscious that have specific results. Since they have been around for so long, much longer than you or I have been alive, they have become <strong>memes</strong>. One begins to wonder if these archetypes were made to illustrate an existing pattern, if they were made to influence people’s natures  in an unnatural way, or if it’s a little of both. Even if they were created innocently (without a negative intent), I still do feel they have an impact on the collective psyche of humanity, with regards to <b>freewill</b>.</p>
<p><b>My Theory is based on Research, Observation, and Personal Experience:</b></p>
<p>The way “law of attraction” is supposed to work is that, focusing on or repeating a certain idea or desire will bring that idea or desire to fruition. The “butterfly effect” refers to the idea that something seemingly small can have a big impact on something else, for example, that a butterfly flapping its wings in Japan could cause a hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean. Both of these theories, which seem to have some validity, combine to make a big mess where the archetypes of <b>tarot</b> and <b>astrology</b> are concerned. These <b>archetypes</b> are assigned to people based on their birthdates, and also sometimes based on numerology, and thus become the “initial conditions” referred to in the “butterfly effect” (see definition below). There are over 1,200 decks of tarot cards in circulation today (3), and they have been printed and reprinted an untold number of times, which, according to the law of attraction, amplifies the vibration of those archetypes. In the meantime, more and more people have been studying these two disciplines in the past 50 years especially, and/or have been getting readings done for them by other people. As more people are exposed to these archetypes, the <b>collective unconscious</b> is increasingly affected by them, in the form of <b>memes</b>. It is the repetition of a pattern that amplifies its vibration, and produces results specific to that pattern. With all these decks out there, and all their subsequent printings, these energies are amplified.</p>
<p>The only way to bring any true freewill back into this world is to abolish the archetypes. I do not say this lightly. By tying someone’s birthdate to the astrology signs and tarot correspondences, freewill is severely restricted, causing people to <i>generally</i> behave in predetermined ways, based on these archetypes. So with astrology, we end up with scorpios being passionate, but also kind of mean, virgos being intelligent and analytical, but sometimes over-critical, aries being assertive, but sometimes pushy, and leos being glamorous, hogs for attention.</p>
<p>The fact that most people in our society seem to fit most of the main character traits for their star signs, whether they believe in astrology or not, shows that these archetypes have been inserted into the collective unconscious, in the form of memes, via archetypal transference, and unbeknownst to the individual. This removes a measure of freewill, causing people to be stuck in cookie cutter personality traits and life patterns.  Astrology has been around for millennia, and has had its impact accordingly. The tarot has only been around for centuries, but has become so popular in recent decades, that it seems to have caused the collective unconscious to become infected with these memes, which are a whole different set of predetermined archetypes. This then further restricts freewill, again based on one’s birthdate.</p>

For example, my mother was born on 4/4, her corresponding trump card was the Emperor, and she displayed the characteristics of the 4<sup>th</sup> trump, most notably from the so-called, Crowley-Thoth deck. The symbols in that card represented the main characters in her life, one example being the two rams behind the seated figure, representing two aries who supported my mother during her life, my father on the left, and maternal grandmother (deceased) on the right. Aliester Crowley was a known Satanist, who is said to have also been an MI6 agent. Frieda Harris painted the deck under his instruction. Did he have an ulterior motive for this deck? Was he putting this energy out there on purpose to affect reality? When I saw this card, in relation to my mother’s 4/4 birthdate, and recognized the significance of that card’s symbols in her life, I began to wonder if my own life was influenced in a similar way, given my double digit birthdate.</p>
<p>Once I began to examine my own life in relation to the tarot, based on my having a 12/12 birthdate, I could not deny that the 12th trump archetype of <a href="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpthoth.jpg"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-221" style="width:125px;height:179px;" alt="12th Trump from the Thoth Tarot Deck" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpthoth.jpg?w=540" srcset="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpthoth.jpg 184w, https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpthoth.jpg?w=102 102w" sizes="(max-width: 184px) 100vw, 184px"   /></a>The Hanged Man, which is an upside-down/reversed figure, had a very significant impact on my development, <i>long before I ever knew the tarot or astrology even existed</i>. Also, please notice how there is an upside-down <b>ankh </b>in this card, which is the Egyptian hieroglyph for “life”. What might that imply? Given the idea of the butterfly effect of these cards being printed over and over again, what might that upside-down ankh ultimately influence in these years surrounding 2012, since it is on the 12<sup>th</sup> trump card? How would it influence the life of a human being, who is unknowingly tied to that card? Could these things have anything to do with how absurd things seem in our world lately with the gross violations of human rights that continues to be perpetrated on <b>nonconsensual human experimentees</b>, and on those who call themselves “<b>targeted individuals</b>”? Could the upside-down and reversed nature of this card have had anything to do with certain unjust things happening in our world today, such as the couple getting arrested for rescuing a baby deer (4)?</p>

So, not wanting to be evil, I endeavored to learn how to write with the right hand. Given the whole left-brain, right-brain concept, which possibly evolved from studies of stroke victims, showing that stroke in the right hemisphere of the brain affects something on the left side of the body, and vice a versa (but I digress), I contend that changing a human being’s natural handedness changes the natural balance in the child’s brain, further subverting freewill. I know of one person, who was born on 10/20 (which carries the 12 vibration &#8211; 1020), who was also made to write right-handed even though he was originally left-inclined. Is that a coincidence?</p>
<p>Both he and I are very creative people, (I was an artist and he a musician), yet we both lack the perseverance to be able to complete creative projects. If we had been allowed to be left-handed, would we have been more successful in our creative endeavors? It is a subject I would like to see investigated. Perhaps someone should do some studies on these people who were naturally left-handed, but made to be right-handed. Maybe one of those illustrious scientists could try that instead of experimenting with brain stimulation using implants which has messed up so many people’s lives, including my own.</p>
<p>This “reverse-curse”, brings us back to the concepts of the “butterfly effect” and “law of attraction”. Causing a “butterfly effect”, the repetition of these archetypes through multiple printings of over 1200 decks, creates a metaphysical effect on the <b>psyche</b>, which in turn, causes a person to emulate these archetypes in some capacity, thereby attracting attributes of their corresponding archetypes. In my case, astrologically, my archetype is Sagittarius, but also Ophiuchus, whose feet do lie on the ecliptic. Now take a look at the 12<sup>th</sup> trump of the Crowley-Harris Thoth deck and compare it to Ophiuchus. Notice any similarities?</p>

<p>In both cases, there is a <b>serpent</b>. It either represents the so-called “<b>serpent class</b>” or the devil himself. In the 12<sup>th</sup> trump, the serpent looks as if it is sucking from the brain of the subject, in the constellation of Ophiuchus, it seems that the subject is <a href="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/deadsnake.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="758" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/01/28/mcusingarchetypaltransference/deadsnake/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/deadsnake.jpg" data-orig-size="259,194" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="deadsnake" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/deadsnake.jpg?w=259" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/deadsnake.jpg?w=259" class="size-full wp-image-758 alignright" alt="deadsnake" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/deadsnake.jpg?w=540" srcset="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/deadsnake.jpg 259w, https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/deadsnake.jpg?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 259px) 100vw, 259px"   /></a>carrying the serpent.  Either way, I see the serpent in these archetypes as a <b>parasite</b>. Hence the background image currently on my YouTube page (shown to the right). I apologize if it looks gross, and I am not an animal killer. I actually really love animals in general. In fact, I feel bad for the snake in that picture. I was just looking for an image that represented how I feel about what has been going on for far too long, in my opinion. While we’re on the subject, why is one of the symbols for America the serpent (as in “Don’t tread on me”)? Could this have been done just to conflict with the Bible, and to cause unconscious confusion and/or <strong>cognitive dissonance </strong>among Americans who happen to be Christian? Hmmm….</p>
<p>Who created these archetypes, anyway? I suspect it was someone <b>playing God</b>. Even the word “archetype” contains “arch” in it, which would be above the head. I see these particular archetypes, which are associated with birthdates, as “<b>graven images</b>” (one could say they have been engraven into the collective unconscious). They have infected the collective unconscious, and have robbed a large measure of freewill from the individual, but have also, therefore robbed that individual of the person they were originally intended to be. Without the existence of these pre-fabricated, pre-appointed, archetypal molds that were put into place centuries and even millennia, before the individual was born, the child who was originally left-handed might have remained left-handed, and the effect on her or his life would have been what the Creator originally intended by making them left-handed in the first place. If you don’t believe in a Creator, then consider that nature also intended for those left-handed children to be left-handed for a reason.</p>
<p>When I take a look at my entire life, I can’t help but wonder if my archetype is an arche-“typo”. I wonder if it is a mistake or if it was done on purpose. It’s a cruel joke, to say the least. Please also consider watching my video about “<b>Symbolism in Words and Numbers</b>” to see more detail about mind control programming, done on such a foundational level. After learning about symbolism, it becomes more obvious that there is a malevolent modus operandi found within the nature of the English language.</p>

<p>Here is an example of an archetype not specific to tarot or astrology, although it is the 11<sup>th</sup> trump in certain, more traditional tarot decks: It is the archetype of justice. Frequently, justice is referred to as being blind. Why is that? Some people say it means that justice is impartial. Well, why not just say “justice is impartial”? Since I have heard and read that phrase, “justice is blind”, often throughout my life, I wonder who came up with that idea. Even most statues depicting this archetype are of a blindfolded woman holding the scales of justice. Justice should never be blind, in my opinion. Rather, it should be able to see all aspects of a situation before rendering judgment on an individual affected by these things. If you are a victim of monarch programming, or a nonconsensual human experimentee, like myself, then you may have noticed that it has been hard to get justice for your situation. If you’re not, you may instead have noticed how the laws in the United States (with the Patriot Act, for example) are changing in ways that seem to remove the original intent of the <b>Constitution</b>, and go directly against the Pledge of Allegiance, wh<a href="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/justiceblind.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="755" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/01/28/mcusingarchetypaltransference/justiceblind/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/justiceblind.jpg" data-orig-size="106,160" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="justiceblind" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/justiceblind.jpg?w=106" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/justiceblind.jpg?w=106" class="alignleft size-full wp-image-755" alt="justiceblind" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/justiceblind.jpg?w=540"   /></a>ich claims the United States of America is “one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all”.</p>
<p>Could this be a “butterfly effect” of the frequently repeated phrase, “<b>Justice is blind</b>”? I think it’s possible. Does the archetype of “blind justice” actually serve the human population? I don’t think it does. Rather, I think “blind justice” serves the criminals who have purposefully enslaved the human population through mind control programming, not only in movies, music, and tell-a-vision, but also through the manipulation of language and archetypes.</p>
<p>Programming via TV, movies, music, and language is done to people on a physical level, meaning that it creates effects on the human mind. However, the creation of these particular archetypes, I feel, was specifically to control people on a more metaphysical level, meaning it has effects on the human spirit, making it less detectable, and therefore more insidious, than those other forms of mind control. Basically, it is what I would call, “<b>archetypal determinism</b>”, done through the projection of specific archetypes assigned by birthdate and numerology, using “the butterfly effect” of over a thousand decks, and untold printings of each, which severely restricts freewill, on an unconscious and psychological level. The “puppet” then, cannot be held responsible for the actions of some unseen “puppet master” who creates and perpetuates these archetypes. That would be akin to “blaming the victim”, a mentality that seems to be occurring on a grand scale these days. The amplification of the vibrations of these archetypes through numerous printings of so many decks becomes nothing but another form of unseen slavery, making human beings into nothing more than metaphysical guinea pigs.</p>
<p>Ah, but we are told that slavery is illegal and doesn’t exist, right? You who are nonconsensual human experimentees might realize that idea as untrue. However, when you try to mention it, you are told you’re crazy. This is known as the <b>double-bind</b> and causes conflict in the psyche, including the manifestation of schizophrenic symptoms.</p>
<p>I would like to give special thanks to Michael Gaio for his article entitled, “Archetypal Semiotic Transference”, because it helped me to see how this stuff works, how it affected me before I ever knew the tarot and astrology existed, and how it affected my mother as well.

<p><b>Chaos theory</b> is the study of nonlinear dynamics, in which <i>seemingly random</i> events are actually predictable from simple deterministic equations.</p>
<p>-From <a href="http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/chaos-theory">http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/chaos-theory</a></p>
<p>Chaos theory studies the behavior of dynamical systems that are highly sensitive to initial conditions, an effect which is popularly referred to as the butterfly effect. Small differences in initial conditions (such as those due to rounding errors in numerical computation) yield widely diverging outcomes for such dynamical systems, rendering long-term prediction impossible in general.[1] This happens even though these systems are deterministic, meaning that their future behavior is fully determined by their initial conditions, with no random elements involved.[2] In other words, the deterministic nature of these systems does not make them predictable.</p>
<p>–From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory</a></p>
<p><b>The Butterfly Effect</b> is first described by Lorenz at the December 1972 meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Washington, D.C., vividly illustrates the essential idea of chaos theory. In a 1963 paper for the New York Academy of Sciences, Lorenz had quoted an unnamed meteorologist&#8217;s assertion that, if chaos theory were true, a single flap of a single seagull&#8217;s wings would be enough to change the course of all future weather systems on the earth.</p>

<p><b>The Law of Attraction</b> refers to the idea that you attract that which you focus on. The movies, “The Secret”, and “What the Bleep Do We Know”, both refer to the Law of Attraction, although “What the Bleep Do We Know” digs more deeply into ideas of Quantum Physics as they relate to the “law of attraction”. See <a href="http://www.abraham-hicks.com/">http://www.abraham-hicks.com/</a> for more information on this concept.</p>
<p><b>Quantum Mechanics</b> provides a mathematical description of much of the dual particle-like and wave-like behavior and interactions of energy and matter.</p>

<p><b>Memes</b> The word meme is a shortening (modeled on gene) of mimeme (from Ancient Greek μίμημα Greek pronunciation: [míːmɛːma] mīmēma, &#8220;imitated thing&#8221;, from μιμεῖσθαι mimeisthai, &#8220;to imitate&#8221;, from μῖμος mimos &#8220;mime&#8221;) and it was coined by the British evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins in The Selfish Gene (1976) as a concept for discussion of evolutionary principles in explaining the spread of ideas and cultural phenomena. Examples of memes given in the book included melodies, catch-phrases, fashion and the technology of building arches.</p>

<p><b>Archetype: </b> 1. An original model or type after which other similar things are patterned; a prototype: &#8220;&#8216;Frankenstein&#8217; . . . &#8216;Dracula&#8217; . . . &#8216;Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde&#8217; . . . the archetypes that have influenced all subsequent horror stories&#8221; (New York Times).</p>
<p>2. An ideal example of a type; quintessence: an archetype of the successful entrepreneur.</p>

<p><b>Transference</b> is the projection of unconscious contents. Jung&#8217;s Studies in Word Association (1906) provided evidence for and referred to Freud&#8217;s concept of transference, published the previous year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     -From <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/transference-counter-transference-analytical-psychology">http://www.answers.com/topic/transference-counter-transference-analytical-psychology</a></p>
<p><b>Collective Consciousness</b> was a term coined by the French sociologist Émile Durkheim (1858–1917) to refer to the shared beliefs and moral attitudes which operate as a unifying force within society.[1]</p>
<p>-From <a href="http://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/collective+unconscious">http://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/collective+unconscious</a></p>
<p><b>Collective Unconscious</b> is a term of analytical psychology, coined by Carl Jung. It is proposed to be a part of the unconscious mind, expressed in humanity and all life forms with nervous systems, and describes how the structure of the psyche autonomously organizes experience. Jung distinguished the collective unconscious from the personal unconscious, in that the personal unconscious is a personal reservoir of experience unique to each individual, while the collective unconscious collects and organizes those personal experiences in a similar way with each member of a particular species.</p>
<p>For Jung, “My thesis then, is as follows: in addition to our immediate consciousness, which is of a thoroughly personal nature and which we believe to be the only empirical psyche (even if we tack on the personal unconscious as an appendix), there exists a second psychic system of a collective, universal, and impersonal nature which is identical in all individuals. This collective unconscious does not develop individually but is inherited. It consists of pre-existent forms, the archetypes, which can only become conscious secondarily and which give definite form to certain psychic contents.&#8221;                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              -From <a href="http://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/Collective+consciousness">http://encyclopedia.thefreedictionary.com/Collective+consciousness</a></p>
<p><b>Cognitive Dissonance</b> is a psychological phenomenon which refers to the discomfort felt at a discrepancy between what you already know or believe, and new information or interpretation. It therefore occurs when there is a need to accommodate new ideas, and it may be necessary for it to develop so that we become &#8220;open&#8221; to them. Neighbour (1992) makes the generation of appropriate dissonance into a major feature of tutorial (and other) teaching: he shows how to drive this kind of intellectual wedge between learners&#8217; current beliefs and &#8220;reality&#8221;.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      -From <a href="http://www.learningandteaching.info/learning/dissonance.htm">http://www.learningandteaching.info/learning/dissonance.htm</a></p>
<p>Two cognitions are said to be dissonant if one cognition follows from the opposite of another. What happens to people when they discover dissonant cognitions? The answer to this question forms the basic postulate of Festinger¹s theory. A person who has dissonant or discrepant cognitions is said to be in a state of psychological dissonance, which is experienced as unpleasant psychological tension. This tension state has drivelike properties that are much like those of hunger and thirst. When a person has been deprived of food for several hours, he/she experiences unpleasant tension and is driven to reduce the unpleasant tension state that results. Reducing the psychological sate of dissonance is not as simple as eating or drinking however.</p>
<p>To understand the alternatives open to an individual in a state of dissonance, we must first understand the factors that affect the magnitude of dissonance arousal. First, in its simplest form, dissonance increases as the degree of discrepancy among cognitions increases. Second, dissonance increases as the number of discrepant cognitions increases. Third, dissonance is inversely proportional to the number of consonant cognitions held by an individual. Fourth, the relative weights given to the consonant and dissonant cognitions may be adjusted by their importance in the mind of the individual.</p>
<p>-From <a href="http://www.ithaca.edu/faculty/stephens/cdback.html">http://www.ithaca.edu/faculty/stephens/cdback.html</a></p>
<p>Cognitive dissonance refers to a situation involving conflicting attitudes, beliefs or behaviors. This produces a feeling of discomfort leading to an alteration in one of the attitudes, beliefs or behaviors to reduce the discomfort and restore balance etc.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     -From <a href="http://www.simplypsychology.org/cognitive-dissonance.html">http://www.simplypsychology.org/cognitive-dissonance.html</a></p>
<p>I contend that cognitive dissonance can occur on both conscious and unconscious levels.</p>
<p><b>Double-bind:</b> Bateson et al. suggest that a person caught in a &#8220;double bind&#8221; &#8212; a situation in which no matter what a person does, he &#8220;can&#8217;t win&#8221; &#8212; may develop schizophrenic symptoms. In the double bind there are two conflicting levels of communication and an injunction against commenting on the conflict. –From <a href="http://laingsociety.org/cetera/pguillaume.htm">http://laingsociety.org/cetera/pguillaume.htm</a></p>

<p>I am owed, by parties cited below (and possibly others not cited below), my life, health, freedom, wellbeing, freewill, and indeed, my very soul, back from all parties involved in the placement of my personal property (myself) into an experimental mind control program, <em>without my consent</em>, that involved the use of RFID-sized implants in my ears, which served to change me from the person I was born to be.</p>
<p>My<b> HUMAN RIGHTS WERE VIOLATED. </b>While there is no amount of money that can recoup my loss or replace what has been stolen from me, I deserve at least that from those involved. I did not consent to be taken from my birthmother, or placed into an experimental program involving the use of <em>implants</em> (see photos below), therefore I am owed all those things above, plus the amount of 5 million dollars for mental anguish, loss of livelihood/employability, for <strong>all</strong> bills acquired by me, which are a direct result of my being influenced by these implants.</p>
<p>Since I can feel both sides of each implant, they obviously go directly through the cartilage of my ears, and it cannot be doubted that they are unnatural foreign objects, and not, as some would say, keloid scars or cutaneous horns. Their size is the same as that of<b> RFID implants. </b>Given the sensations I experience and have experienced through them, I must conclude they are some form of microchip or RFID chip.</p>

<p><b>                                            </b></p>
<p><b>This bill is directed to, but not limited to, the following participating parties:</b></p>
<p>Catholic Charities for possibly stealing me from my natural parents, for holding me in their custody for the first 6 weeks of my life, causing an <strong>attachment disorder</strong>, and for placing me in a family, solely because they had money (upper middle class in the late 60s) but were not necessarily meant to raise more children. I was often left alone, neglected, verbally and sometimes physically abused, and was given television as a main baby sitter. I had a near drowning at 3y/o. I was allowed to play alone in the woods at 6 years old and beyond. I spent the latter half of my childhood in a literal house of mirrors. The use of <strong>mirrors in mind control</strong> is a heavily documented subject, and drownings at the age of 3 are often cited in <strong>ritual abuse</strong> cases.</p>
<p>Whatever company or entity manufactured the RFID chips that are in my ears.</p>
<p>Whatever doctor or entity implanted those chips into my ears.</p>
<p>Whatever agency, group, company, entity, or human being that authorized the placement of those chips into my ears.</p>
<p>Whatever agency, group, company, entity, or human being that utilized the implanted RFID chips for whatever experiment I was involved in, past, present, or future.</p>
<p>Whatever group, company, entity, or human being who profited from the placement of said implants.</p>
<p>Whatever group, company, entity, or human being who profited from the suffering endured by me as a result of the placement of me in any experimental program, including any program that involved the use of any implanted chips on my body.</p>
<p><strong>Here is a short explanation of what I have been through as a result of what was done to me:</strong></p>
<p>I was born in the late 60s, after <strong>Dr. Jose Delgado</strong> had begun working on <em>brain stimulation</em> with implants in the heads of rats, cats, dogs, and even a bull. He was able to “<strong>play animals like instruments</strong>”. This research was begun in the early 50s, at least 15 years before I was born. This technology has positive aspects in the ability to improve the quality of life for many people who are disabled, but it obviously fell into the wrong hands, because it had powerful, far-reaching, negative effects on my quality of life and on my emotional wellbeing.</p>
<p>Since I have never felt pain in the sites of these implants, I am forced to conclude that they have been with me since birth. Since I was held in custody of the adoption agency for the first 6 weeks of my life, it seems logical to think that it was most likely done during the period between 12/12/1967 and 1/22/1968. If they were implanted during that time, they may have been used to “play me” in the same way that Dr. Delgado’s animals were “played”. <em>This means that various parts of my brain were possibly stimulated to make me depressed, sad, lonely, apathetic, emotionally disturbed, causing me to make very bad decisions in life, and to eventually become a drug addict, so that I would be easily labeled and discredited</em>. I am no longer a drug addict, but have been left with emotional <strong>trauma</strong> that I cannot heal.</p>
<p>It must be noted that, when these “chips” were implanted in my head, it was <strong>WITHOUT MY CONSENT</strong>, AND it was most certainly <strong>NOT LEGAL</strong> to do so. Even if they were somehow implanted into my head during my last surgery in November of 2004 (and I am not saying they were), it was still NOT LEGAL to do so without my consent. That being said, I never felt pain in the sites of the implants after that surgery in 2004, or after any surgery I have ever had, which is why I believe it was done to me as an infant, which is reprehensible.</p>
<p>I am not necessarily blaming my adoptive parents because I do not know how much they knew about my having implants (although I do suspect some knowledge on the part of my father), they could have just been following the pattern they grew up with. I am not blaming my adoptive brother, because I know how he was treated when he lived in the house with us, although he did do a number of things that were frightening, to say the least.</p>
<p>The combination of childhood neglect and abuse, having TV as a main babysitter (flicker-rate/refresh-rate hypnosis), and being implanted with <strong>RFID chips</strong> in each ear, which have been influencing me on a <strong>subliminal</strong> level throughout my life, thereby removing a large portion of my freewill, have prohibited me from reaching my true potential &amp; have stolen the person I was meant to be from me. This is nothing to say of the effects of <em>flicker-rate hypnosis</em> &amp; <em>post hypnotic suggestion</em>.</p>
<p>All that would be needed to determine the responsible parties would be to remove at least one implant and find a serial number from it. This would allow me to track down the manufacturer and who they sold it to. <strong>IF I DIE</strong> before I am able to do this, I ask for an <strong>AUTOPSY</strong> to be performed, to remove these implants, and track down the manufacturer. I am asking for this because my quality of life has severely declined over the past few years, since I became a target for what is now being called &#8220;<strong>soft kill</strong>&#8220;, &#8220;<strong>slow kill</strong>&#8220;, and &#8220;<strong>no-touch torture</strong>&#8220;, and I am concerned about how much time I have left. I suffer all the symptoms of other <strong>targeted indiviuals</strong>.</p>
<p>I have been <strong>VIOLATED</strong> on a level that is difficult to quantify, but I am trying my best to put it into words.</p>
<p>By the way, I was not born into this world, to be ripped off by the collective, and given next to nothing in return. Those who were &amp; are involved in doing this to me will be damned as they have damned me. Period. End of story.</p>

<p><b>Some people will say I am playing the victim, but I assure you that this is not by choice. </b></p>
<p><b>Some people will say I am lying, but you cannot make this stuff up, and I have photos that prove, at least, that I was implanted. If they were cartilage or keloids, they would not be delivering sounds and buzzing sensations through them.

<p>My daughter was born, in Oct of 2004, delivered via C-section. The very next month, I and my daughter both had surgeries. She had a surgery for pyloric stenosis, and I had one for cervical dysplasia. Both of us were put under general anesthetic. I have since had flashbacks of something very terrible being done to me in my privates, causing a constant physical pain that came out in Sept of 2008, in the form of <b>vulvodynia, a disease marked by constant vaginal pain and contractions</b>, <b>often caused by previous</b>  <b>trauma</b> in the area. When I describe my symptoms to people, some people believe it is <b>demons</b> doing it to me. That being said, in 2010, I had a memory resurface of the doctor (replete with surgical mask) doing something to my privates with a loud (“whirring sounding”) instrument, during which I could hear my own mother speaking to me, and I could hear my own screams. The fact that I could hear my own screams tells me this is a “<b>flashback</b>”, of a memory of an event that my mind had to repress to keep me sane. The fact that my mother was involved in this procedure, and in my flashback, I can clearly hear her telling me, “what a great hero you’re being for your country”, combined with the fact that my mother is now dead, tells me that they not only did something terrible to me, but that they might have killed her so that she would not be able to be questioned. The procedure was done by my OB/GYN, Romeo Acosta. I have been in constant pain in the area for around four years now. The pain itself is traumatic.</p>
<p>In May of 2008, I discovered implants, located just in front of each ear. I have no idea how long they’ve been there. I had an oral surgery in 1984 under a general anesthetic, and I had an oral surgery in 2001 or 2002 (I’m not sure of the date), under a general anesthetic. Although it could have happened when I was adopted and held by the Catholic agency (that has since been indicted on <b>child-trafficking </b>charges) for about 6 weeks before my family got me, even though they had my birthmother set up with my adoptive mother long before I was born.</p>

<div class="mceTemp"></div>
<p>Considering the fact that I never felt pain in the locations of these implants after any surgery, I am forced to assume that they were put in before I can remember. I now hear voices through them and I have buzzing and painful sensations coming through them. As you can see from this image, they are not visible until I gently pull back on my ear, but they are definitely there. It was maybe a few months before I discovered the implants that I began to hear voices. At first, I heard a voice telling me to “purge”, as if referring to memories that were coming back to me, at that time. I also was made to believe that some of the voices were angels and that one of them was God. These voices communicated all manner of things to me, making me appear schizophrenic, so that I would be easily discredited (but I was suspiciously denied for social security disability despite the fact that I was given schizophrenic meds by the free clinic). The fact that I have these two lumps in my head cast a reasonable doubt on the idea that I may be schizophrenic. Also casting doubt on the schizophrenia diagnosis is the fact that the lithium and other meds I was given actually made the voices get worse.</p>
<p>At the end of August, 2008, I was left in a foreclosed home with no power or water, when my boyfriend left with our daughter. This happened as a result of me hearing voices and following their commands, thus appearing crazy. At that time, the voices coming through the implants, I didn’t yet know about, were telling me that my real family was coming to find me, prompting me to go around looking for them. Well, they lied, but this made me look nuts. In early September of the same year, I found myself in the worst pain I had ever experienced in my life. While in this constant pain, I stayed in that house for about 2.5 years, in the worst heat and, at times, in freezing temperatures. I had no vehicle and had no way of getting around, in order to try to get a job. During that time these voices, coming through the implants, told me that certain people, in my life were causing my pain. This made me send very negative energies at these people. Also during that time, in the worst heat of summer, a police helicopter woke me up at 2:30am, flying in a circular pattern, around that house, shining the spotlight into the windows for over a half an hour, which was traumatizing to say the least. <b>During this helicopter trauma, no police vehicle came to the house, which makes the entire event suspect of someone trying to traumatize me on purpose.</b></p>
<p>While my boyfriend had a decent excuse for leaving, and for trying to have me locked up 3 times, thereby costing me the one job I ever truly loved in my life, his treatment of me during that time was downright cruel at times. For example, when he left, he promised to leave me with one of our two vehicles, but he ended up taking it instead. Also, there was one time, within the year after he had left, and I had no job at that point, and I was alone in pain, unable to walk much, and without a vehicle, trying to work with crystals to heal myself, I had no money and no way to get food. I ended up having to sell some of his tools. He busted in the door and yelled at me. He went to smash my crystals, and I tried to stop him by putting my arms between his hands and my crystals. He then grabbed me by the arms and threw me on the floor. This happened three times, and on the 3<sup>rd</sup> time, I hit the chair first. Then he grabbed my cell phone, ran out the front door, shutting it behind him &amp; held it closed while he called the cops to accuse me of domestic violence. HE LIED, &amp; I’M PRETTY SURE THAT COP KNOWS IT. This man is 6’3” tall and is almost twice my size, in weight and stature combined. There is no way I could ever physically harm or abuse him. I mean, come on now!</p>
<p>Most people are aware that the <b>Catholic Church has been indicted on child-trafficking charges, in connection to satanic ritual abuse</b>. I was adopted through Catholic Charities, which also has some record of being involved in child-trafficking. Many people are aware of the existence of <b>ritual abuse and mind control</b>, especially that which has been uncovered, during the 1977 MK Ultra Senate Hearings, to have occurred in the 50s and 60s, to witting and unwitting victims. In those hearings, it was discovered that many files of these horrendous experiments were destroyed. While it has been stated that these secret programs ended at least 12 years prior to the 1977 hearings, the fact that they were secret in the first place, leads me to believe that other programs continued after the one known as <b>MK Ultra</b> had ended. The experts involved in this and other secret programs were often Nazi scientists brought into our country, under what is known as “<b>Project Paperclip</b>”. Some such “experts” include Joseph Mengele, Ewen Cameron, and Jose Delgado. Many of the Nazi scientists were experts in the <b>occult</b>. Other mind control programs that are documented include: <b>Project Naomi, Project Artichoke, Project Monarch, and Project Delta. </b>A common practice involved in these mind control programs was to use adopted children and children from orphanages. Most experts on mind control know about the use of occult symbolism.</p>
<p>Beyond typical mind control and ritual abuse, involving a <b>drowning at 3y/o</b> (which is common to ritual abuse survivors), I have been unknowingly, unwittingly living under an occult curse my entire life. I only became aware of it within the past four years, when I discovered the Thoth tarot deck and its’ uncanny connection to my life, as noted in the e-books, “<b>Meta Crime</b>”, and “<b>Symbolism, Mind Control, and Metaphysical Sabotage in Relation to Archetypal Transference and the Second Commandment of the Decalogue</b>”. This curse is tied to my birthdate with the 12<sup>th</sup> trump of the tarot, which, in almost every single deck (of which there are over a thousand in print today), is an upside-down figure. In at least three different decks, there is a serpent close to the victim’s head, or attached to it with rays. I have read a document entitled, “Project Monarch – Nazi Mind Control”, on the internet, which states: “One of the earliest writings giving reference to occultism is the <b>Egyptian Book of the Dead</b>, a compilation of rituals explicitly describing methods of torture and intimidation (to create trauma), the use of potions (drugs) and the casting of spells (hypnotism), ultimately resulting in the total enslavement of the initiate. These have been the main ingredients for a part of occultism known as <b>Satanism</b>, throughout the ages.” In the Crowley Thoth deck (Thoth is the Egyptian God mostly associated with magic, writing, science, and judgment of the dead) the serpent either represents Satan himself, or it represents the so-called “<b>serpent class</b>”, who are adepts at the occult. Also in at least three different decks, is an upside-down <b>ankh</b>, which is the Egyptian symbol for life and fertility, a symbol that closely resembles the currently accepted sign of female. For some reason, I was always very attached to the symbol of the Ankh, while never knowing what symbolism meant. The 12<sup>th</sup> trump card is a <b>graven image</b> in the respect that it is an image of suffering and/or death. This curse has made it impossible for me to live a normal life, or have any true freewill, because I have been metaphorically upside-down or reversed throughout my entire life. The reversed nature of the card, and especially of the upside-down ankh in the 12<sup>th</sup> trump of at least three decks of the tarot, has caused that reversed vibration to manifest itself in my life, in the following ways:</p>
<p>1)      I was naturally left handed, but the person teaching me to write made me be right handed, by telling me that left-handedness is evil. I was a small child when this happened, but over time, it had the effect of helping to make me a very negative person.</p>
<p>2)      My mother named me with initials that spelled the word for a specific animal, <b>dehumanizing</b> me. Later, she would tell me, “I don’t know why I named you that, I don’t even like cats”.</p>
<p>3)      My mother constantly put me down, bullied me, called me names, and held other people’s children over her own, comparing me to my cousins, my friends, often telling me that I was no good and that I would “never amount to anything”.</p>
<p>4)      My mother (born on 4/4 which corresponds to the 4<sup>th</sup> trump, the Emperor card) had way too much power to be raising someone in such a prone position, as what is displayed on the 12th trump. This card, backed with some sort of occult intent to make a living sacrifice on a metaphysical level, created an energy of powerlessness. The voices coming through those implants tell me that I am to be a ritual blood sacrifice.</p>
<p>5)      The television (tell-a-vision) was my primary babysitter. I was left alone in my childhood, and was even allowed to play alone in the woods at 6 and 7 years old. Anything could’ve happened back then (including being implanted), since I have memories of going to the woods, memories of playing in the woods, but no memories of coming home. Doesn’t that seem strange to anyone besides me?</p>
<p>6)      My mother smoked 3 packs of cigarettes daily, exposing me, because they did not know the impact of second hand smoke on a baby back then, which addicted me to nicotine at a very early age, and caused me to have asthma.</p>
<p>7)      My brother often enjoyed terrorizing me. One such example I can cite is of him wrapping me up in a blanket and tossing me down the stairs. When I got to the bottom of those stairs, I pushed the blanket off of me, and saw my parents laughing at me.</p>
<p>Regarding other accusations about things I may or may not have done in my lifetime: Anything I am actually guilty of is <b>directly attributable</b> to the <b>occult curse</b> I have been living under throughout my life. However, I have done comparably little evil in this world, when compared to what has been done to me. Considering the fact that I have implants in my head, that are easily provable, there is no telling how long I have been subliminally affected by them, or what the voices coming through them have said to me in my sleep. Yet, I’ve never gone out and killed anyone, and I never will.</p>
<p><b>That being said, the following is a list of accusations and responses to them:</b></p>
<p>1)      I have been accused of not sharing, but if one considers how my whole life was orchestrated and my inspiration was stolen from me via the serpent class, as represented by the snake at the head of the victim in the 12<sup>th</sup> trump of the <b>Thoth</b>, <b>Ludovica</b>, and<b> Hermetic</b> tarot decks, then it would stand to reason that I would have a subconscious need to hold onto things, as a security issue, given that I was subconsciously seeing my own creative ideas being stolen. For example, artistic ideas were stolen from me (C.A.T.) by people like M.J. Skinner (“skin the cat”). That being said, let it be known that when I saw others who were truly in need, even when I was myself living in substandard conditions, I still shared what I had. Please see my document entitled, “<b>Metaphysical Sabotage</b>”.</p>
<p>2)      I have been accused of being a pedophile ….   This is simply ridiculous and doesn’t even deserve a response, but the answer is: NO, I AM NOT A PEDOPHILE, NOR HAVE I EVER KISSED OR DONE ANYTHING REMOTELY SEXUAL WITH ANYONE UNDER AGE,. HOWEVER, I MYSELF WAS DATE-RAPED, WHEN I WAS 16 Y/O, BY A 21 Y/O, AND IT WAS MY VERY FIRST EXPERIENCE OF INTERCOURSE. I NEVER PROSECUTED HIM.</p>
<p>3)      I have been accused of being a racist ….  Never in my life have I ever been racist, nor have I ever discriminated on the basis of anything. In fact, even as a child, I always showed the utmost respect for oppressed races and cultures.</p>
<p>4)      I have been accused of being a baby killer. While I deeply regret having two abortions, I had no parents around raising me, and as a result, I ended up following much of what those around me believed, especially the males, because I sorely lacked a father figure in my life. At one point, I ended up with a boyfriend who as prochoice and exposed me to the book called “Our Bodies Ourselves”, which approved of abortion. Unbeknownst to me, my subconscious was having a strong influence in my life, and had me always seeking out a daddy. In my late teens and early twenties (and even into my 30s), I was easily influenced by every boyfriend I had.</p>
<p>5)      I have been accused of being lazy. Up until I found myself in excruciating pain, I have always taken relatively good care of my home, until I found myself simultaneously working, taking care of a toddler, and trying to keep house from 2005 until 2008.</p>
<p>6)      I have been accused of being a whore, which I am most certainly not. There have been short moments in my life, when I was forced to live like one, like when I was living in the streets, but I am not one, and have not truly ever been one.</p>
<p>7)      I was a latchkey kid from 9y/o until I moved out, even though my mother didn’t have to work during that time, at all.</p>
<p>8)      As previously discussed, I have been living under an occult curse my entire life, as a result of my birthdate in relation to the 12<sup>th</sup> trump of the Thoth tarot, with the upside-down ankh (the Egyptian symbol for life &amp; fertility), with my mother being the 4<sup>th</sup> trump, allowing her way too much power over me.</p>
<p>9)      I have been accused of being a narcissist … I spent half my childhood in a house of mirrors, with a narcissist mother, in which there was a completely mirrored coffee table, the closet doors were mirrored, the bedroom sets were mirrored, and even the wallpaper was mirrored. Can you say PSYOPS? What does growing up in a house of mirrors do to a child anyway? So I probably WAS one, but I am not one now. For info on the role mirrors play in mind control, please see the following: <a href="http://www.theforbiddenknowledge.com/hardtruth/mind_control_art.htm">http://www.theforbiddenknowledge.com/hardtruth/mind_control_art.htm</a></p>
<p>For more info on general mind control programming, including the use of mirrors, see the Fritz Springmeier and Cisco Wheeler document about &#8220;Undetectable Mind Controlled Slaves&#8221;, here: <a href="http://www.emhdf.com/Monarch-mind-control.pdf">http://www.emhdf.com/Monarch-mind-control.pdf</a></p>
<p>10)   I have been accused of being “cruel” …  well, I couldn’t have possibly been as cruel to my child as the catholic church has been to me, by holding me in custody for the first 6 weeks of my life (with no parental bonding), or by allowing some agency to put implants in my head. There was a time, when I was in my late teens or early twenties when this guy named Bob punched me and threw me into a sliding glass door. I retaliated after being goaded by his own friends. I am not proud of what I did. I painted his member red. Even to this day, when I have repented of it to people I know, I was told it was “funny” not “horrible”, and that he deserved it for hitting a woman. However, I sincerely regret it.</p>
<p>11)   If the accusation is in relation to me name calling or being a bully when I was younger… well, my parents were bullies to me (mom called me stupid, while dad called me fat). Growing up, my friends made up names for others, and so did I. “When in Rome, etc.” I think this is where that came from, but I changed. For example, there was a teacher in my school named Emma Mosteller, and my friend, Lucianne, made up the name, “Enima Molester”. I subsequently called my friend “Lusty Anus”. I am not proud of it, but I was following a pattern. Considering the fact that I was metaphorically upside-down, it should come as no surprise.</p>
<p>12)   I have been told that “you snooze you lose”, regarding the fact that, after I lost my job, finding myself in horrible, nightmarish pain, with no vehicle, no place to go, and living in a foreclosed house with no power or water, it took me over three years to begin writing about my experiences in any coherent way. I had virtually no access to a computer, so I was unable to learn much of anything in relation to the curse, or anything else for that matter. When I was able to get to a library, I found many books unavailable. I contend that I was not snoozing, rather, I was cut off from every outlet to state my case for forgiveness, once I began to learn of the metaphysical curse I had been living under throughout my life. Also, I was in a state of constant traumatic pain and hearing voices through these implants, which I sometimes want to call “headphones”. Even friends and neighbors would rarely let me use their computers to get online, so I was unable to post my experiences. When I was able to get online, I was hit with either (at neighbor&#8217;s house) someone talking in my face during the whole time, which distracted me, or (at library) I would be inundated with various voices throwing me off track, or scaring me into leaving with threats. Wherever I went for help regarding my specific problem, I was not able to get adequate treatment, which I sincerely hope will change soon. Whoever is responsible for the ongoing Traumatic Stress Disorder should have to face some consequences for their actions, because its goal seems to be just to make me appear insane, or to actually drive me insane, but it seems like there is some agency that does not truly want me to get help, or recover.</p>
<p>13)   I have been accused of being a liar … Honestly, when I was younger, I did make things up to try to get attention from my parents, because they were simply absent during my childhood, but I did change. In fact, I made the conscious effort to change because I did not like getting attention that way, and I didn&#8217;t want to be a liar. At the risk of being labeled a liar by my accusers/gang-stalkers, I am being honest about my past. At one point, after discovering what was happening to me, I believed that one of my doctors (OB/GYN) might have been named Delgado, but I have since researched my personal files, and realized that neither one of them had that name. <i>This tells me that these verifiable implants have been used to enforce the idea that I had a doctor named Delgado, just so someone could then paint me as a liar</i>. While it is possible I had an oral surgeon by that name, I cannot verify the name of the last oral surgeon I had, who was in St. Petersburg, FL. The first oral surgeon I had was named Castellano, and was in Tampa. Regardless of what doctor put the implants in, and what doctor did the horrifying procedure to my privates, the flashback and the pain are absolutely real. <b>I have no doubt that trauma occurred in my privates to cause it, but of course, no one wants to believe it, or give me a true exam, or even give me pain medication for it. </b>The trauma to my privates has caused the condition noted above called vulvodynia, which is a constant pain in the area, usually caused by a<b> previous trauma to the area</b>.</p>
<p>14)   I have been called a “user” … I honestly do not want to be disabled, not in the least. I have always worked very hard for my money, and in most job I’ve held, I was always the top performer. However, I am suffering from severe PTSD due to the horrible and evil events that happened to me. The obvious implants, that are located in front of each ear, may have subliminally influenced me the whole time they have been in place. For all I know, they may have been sending me subliminal messages during my sleep to make me psychologically unwell.</p>
<p>What was done to me, throughout my life, violated every law imaginable at the time of my adoption. From what I understand, back in the 60s, it was illegal to put implants in a child&#8217;s ears, and mind control was illegal. These days, it seems to be the norm, as I can see and hear it in the music, movies, and television. Since the patriot virtually repealed every human right we had in our constitution, those who wish to subvert human rights seem to have been given carte blanche to do so.</p>
<p>If there is an honorable attorney out there, who recognizes that at the very least, that I should be grandfathered in to being able to sue those responsible for my implants, due to the date of implantation, I would love to hear from one. I have read that one can find the manufacturer of an implant by examining it under a microscope.</p>
<p>I believe I was sold into slavery, to be a part of some horrible macabre experiment, designed to influence me in a subliminal and insidious way, to do things against my true nature and freewill. I hope those who are inflicting this &#8220;soft-kill/no-touch torture&#8221;, as well as that those who put the implants in my ears are someday held liable for their actions, for what they are doing and have done to me is the most heinous crime I could&#8217;ve ever thought possible.</p>
<p>I pray every day that someone can help me. I am living in what I can only describe as a mental concentration camp.</p>
