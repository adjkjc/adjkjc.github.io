Some say aliens are responsible. Some people say it is demonic in nature &amp; accepting Jesus Christ as your personal savior is the only way to find relief. Some say this phenomena is &#8220;<strong>cause stalking</strong>&#8221; by a group of people who have <strong>judged</strong> the victim<strong> in absentia</strong>. Even still, there are those people, like some bloggers, who say it is something like &#8220;a godlike entity manipulating humanity&#8221;. I even read where one blogger overheard his handlers referring to him as &#8220;<strong>the sacrifice</strong>&#8220;.</p>
<p>As a victim of this, it becomes very difficult to know what the actual truth is. I am harassed with voices, directed conversation, pain, some sort of radiation hits in the chest, crotch, head, to the point where I honestly don&#8217;t understand what is happening. I am not alone in this, as I have read &amp; seen many other victims of this horrendous crime speak out about the exact same things. One begins to wonder if God is really a cruel entity allowing these things to go on, or worse, causing them, which is something I really <em>don&#8217;t want</em> to believe. If I am wrong about this, then I beg forgiveness, but I am confused about this issue.</p>

In my case, however, the very visible &amp; obvious <strong>implants</strong> in my ears make it all to clear that someone has been controlling me throughout my life. Since it is well-known that <strong>Dr. Jose Delgado</strong> was doing his research into <strong>brain stimulation</strong> with implants back in the 1950s &amp; for at least 20 years, it is not hard to imagine that I might&#8217;ve been sold into this &#8220;<strong>program</strong>&#8221; as a baby, through adoption. I have noticed that there is a predominance of adoptees &amp; foster kids who are victims, who blog &amp; vlog about this horrible situation. This is telling.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m so sorry for those who are suffering through this. <em>No one deserves it</em>, especially when you consider the overarching problem at the root of all of this. The problem that I see is that mind control has been happening on some level, for centuries at least. Mind control, by definition, <em>removes</em> freewill, &amp; there are many ways in which mind control is used to subtly influence people. The <strong>flicker rate</strong> of tv &amp; movies alone is enough to hypnotize people, especially children. Any <strong>subliminal messages</strong> in movies or television, such as hidden <strong>symbolism</strong>, access the <strong>subconscious mind</strong> directly, especially while people are in a <strong>trance</strong>. It is the manipulation of the human mind, which again, removes freewill.</p>
<p>It does seem that <strong>trauma</strong> plays a role in how much of an impact mind control has on an individual. It is now professionally recognized that adoption is a trauma for the baby, so it stands to reason that being placed in foster care, or any separation of a child from it&#8217;s natural parents would then also be traumatic. What about other traumas that occur in infancy &amp; early childhood? Like the near drowning at 3 years old, cited by so many ritual abuse victims? How about circumcision at birth? What about the onslaught of tests, immunizations, goo in the eyes, separation from mother, endured by most newborns born in hospitals? Could it be that these early traumas have a purpose beyond what is stated regarding the reasons for what is cited above?</p>

We were totally <strong>brainwashed</strong>. I can only imagine how many veterans (who were programed to be heroes, via TV &amp; movies) are now being mentally harassed, blamed for everything they might&#8217;ve done during wartime. I say this because I know that I am constantly blamed for things in my past, even though it is clear that <em>I never truly had freewill</em> in my life, do to the many ways in which I was affected by mind control.</p>
<p><strong>I have observed multiple ways a &#8220;system&#8221; can exert mind control over it&#8217;s population:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1) Religion</strong>&#8211; Religion has a long history of being used to control the masses. Children are brought up in a religion &amp; know nothing else. Most of these religions are pagan in origin, but vehemently deny that fact, &amp; then carry on with obvious pagan traditions. This would naturally cause a conflict in a child&#8217;s mind. The bible warns that &#8220;Christians would be persecuted in the so-called &#8220;end times&#8221;. Is it a coincidence that I know a fellow TI who&#8217;s name is &#8220;Christian&#8221;? I doubt it.</p>
<p><strong>2) Education</strong>&#8211; The educational system in the US especially, has a specific slanted point of view. If a child does not internalize this point of view, they end up with poor grades &amp; labeled as losers.</p>
<p><strong>3) Parenting</strong>&#8211; Parents have a specific point of view &amp; want their children at least to understand it, but some parents enforce their point of view on their children. But worse than this is the fact that some parents simply leave their kids alone most of the time, only giving negative attention to them. This is a form of <em>negative programming</em>.</p>
<p><strong>4) Media (TV, movies, music, talk radio, etc.)-</strong> Growing up with the mass media, I can attest to the fact that it shaped my beliefs, especially since I had negative programming from my own parents, &amp; was mostly left alone by them. Television was my primary baby sitter. There are subliminals in movies &amp; television to be sure, but also in music. Some messages are in the form of cleverly hidden artwork or backwards masking, but others can be found in the themes, which get repeated over &amp; over in multiple movies &amp; stories viewed by adults &amp; children alike. As I&#8217;ve seen others point out, there is a reason why they call it &#8220;television programming&#8221;. There are those who will vehemently deny that subliminal programming exists, even when it is right in your face (see <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmMnnOr-lYQ"><br /> Subliminal Sex Messages and Pornography in Advertising and Cartoons </a>). However, the flicker rate of television &amp; movies alone is enough to put people in a trance, especially when in front of the big-screen. Ever notice how large tv screens are these days? And why all that push for people to get HDTV even to the point of giving away free converters to people? Ever since that happened, it sure seems like things changed really quickly. It is like Orwell&#8217;s <strong>1984</strong>, just a little bit different.</p>
<p><strong>5) Language</strong>&#8211; If you take a good, hard look at the English language, you will find negative root words in many other words &amp; proper names. I have a video on this, called <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMe5Y4Hs_7c">&#8220;Mind Control Using Symbolism in Language and Numbers&#8221;</a>. A couple of examples though: how many words can you find with the root words mar, war, ill, or ow in them? This attests to how society, which learns language very young, is controlled by a very negative base program. There is this symbolism inherent in our language, some of it is visual (reading), while some of it is phonetic (hearing). You might consider your own name &amp; how you might&#8217;ve been treated by others throughout your life based on it.</p>
<p><strong>6) Controlled Opposition Groups</strong>&#8211; These are groups formed with the specific intent of controlling any opposition to the &#8220;system&#8221; (i.e. cult-ure or society). They are often, but not exclusively, from other countries, coming over to the US to alert people to the existence of mind control. Then, when people begin to wake up, they are targeted by the system that wants to defend its existence. They use mind control techniques such as NLP (neuro-linguistic programming) to give them a powerful influence on people.</p>
<p><strong>7)</strong> <strong>Occult Practices</strong>&#8211; Mind Control has been going on at least since the Pharos in Egypt, but more likely, it goes back to the Druids. They&#8217;ve been using drugs &amp; hypnotism for centuries, possibly much longer, and believe it or not, black magic &amp; voodoo are also involved. They are pushing forth an intent to influence individuals &amp; society as a whole, using <strong>meta-physical technologies</strong>, the knowledge of which has been passed down through their generations, the result of which has effects on the spirit of a person. Psyche comes from a Greek word referring to the spirit. Knowing the psychology of human beings allows for a greater influence over them.</p>
<p><strong>8)</strong> <strong>Implants &amp; Other Physical Technologies</strong>&#8211; When I consider the work of Nazi scientists &amp; the fact that the US brought them to this country under &#8220;<strong>Project Paperclip</strong>&#8221; to continue their experiments, it becomes extremely difficult for me to ignore the possibility that people are actually sold into programs of mind control experimentation, sometimes by their own parents. Technologies such as brain implants (see Dr. Jose Delgado&#8217;s work in the 1950s &amp; 60s), are used to completely wreck a person&#8217;s life or to enhance it.</p>
<p>The positive implications for mind control make it absolutely disgusting that they are using it to influence so many people in such negative ways. I mean, they could use it to help people quit smoking, for example, or to make people more successful &amp; therefore allow them to make better contributions to the world. So, why wouldn&#8217;t they?</p>
<p>It is my theory that those who are responsible for the most intense aspects of mind control, such as implants, do actually use<img data-attachment-id="924" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/07/04/mind-control-and-the-targeted-individual/goldendawn/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/goldendawn.jpg" data-orig-size="200,282" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="goldendawn" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/goldendawn.jpg?w=200" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/goldendawn.jpg?w=200" class="alignright  wp-image-924" alt="goldendawn" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/goldendawn.jpg?w=128&#038;h=181" width="128" height="181" srcset="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/goldendawn.jpg?w=128&amp;h=181 128w, https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/goldendawn.jpg?w=106&amp;h=150 106w, https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/goldendawn.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 128px) 100vw, 128px" /> it for positive purposes, but only on pre-designated people (i.e. the ones they can control the most), while for others (the ones they deem as the &#8220;losers&#8221;), it is used to keep that class of people down. It seems that they are keeping a balance by doing this: one group is brought to new heights, while the other is brought to extreme lows.</p>

The hexagram is prominently displayed in the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, &amp; it is also used in Theosophy. Both of these organizations, among others, are so-called &#8220;Secret Societies&#8221;, who, like the Freemasons, allow only those at the very top of the hierarchy to know the full truth of their methods &amp; practices, and what their role is in society at large. The hexagram is only one example of a <em>meta-physical technology</em>.</p>
<p>Those who are TIs are suffering as a result of being put at the pinnacle of an upside-down triangle, while their &#8220;chosen ones&#8221; are placed at the top.</p>
<p>It is also my theory that the ones who are held down, throughout their lives are then used for the creative inspiration that naturally comes from this sort of <strong>oppression</strong>. This inspiration gleaned from victims ultimately shows up in TV, movies, &amp; music, which means that there is a whole class of people benefitting from another class&#8217; suffering. It is an unspoken, unacknowledged form of <strong>slavery</strong> that can only result in emotional issues for the <strong>unwitting victims</strong>. These issues would then cause the victim to act out in a variety of ways, throughout their lives, since on some subconscious level, they probably know that they have been <strong>covertly enslaved</strong>.</p>
<p>This makes the <strong>TI</strong> the ultimate <strong>muse</strong> for an elitist system that sees people as mere &#8220;<strong>human resources</strong>&#8221; to be &#8220;utilized&#8221;. Trying to get any compensation or justice for what has been done to them, simply makes them look &#8220;crazy&#8221; or schizophrenic to those who don&#8217;t understand such a thing. However, part of me wonders if maybe everyone around the victim is well <img data-attachment-id="755" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/01/28/mcusingarchetypaltransference/justiceblind/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/justiceblind.jpg" data-orig-size="106,160" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="justiceblind" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/justiceblind.jpg?w=106" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/justiceblind.jpg?w=106" class="alignright size-full wp-image-755" alt="justiceblind" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/justiceblind.jpg?w=540"   />aware of the nightmare going on in front of their faces &amp; simply refuse to acknowledge it, lest the victim have a foothold into getting any justice for what has been done. There is a reason why &#8220;<strong>justice is blind</strong>&#8221; is a well-known phrase in this world, &amp; it has absolutely nothing to do with impartiality.</p>
<p>I am pretty sure that the idea of justice is now nothing more than a simulacrum of the original concept.</p>
<p>In my own situation, it seems that my whole life has been orchestrated, unbeknownst to me until more recently. I only just began to wake up to the situation in 2008, which is, coincidentally, the same year that I discovered I had implants in each ear. Symbolically &amp; psychologically, my life seems to have been completely manipulated to make me negative, sad, confused, depressed, &amp; apathetic. I have even seen how some of the more &#8220;metaphysical&#8221; technologies affected my adoptive mother&#8217;s life.</p>
<p>Some people would call what is happening to Targeted Individuals an affliction, but I would call it an <em>infliction</em> because it is inflicted on us by some other entity or entities.</p>
<p>When you present obvious evidence &amp; people don&#8217;t believe you, it can be extremely frustrating. Many of the same people who admit that the powers that be are using symbolism to manipulate human beings, will then deny the possibility that a person has been manipulated in this way. Many people who admit that there is all sorts of technology being used against people will then deny that implants exist, even though Dr. Delgado&#8217;s work in brain stimulation is well-known. This seems to be by design &amp; with the intent of driving the victim mad.</p>
<p>This will result in further discrediting the victim, who has most likely already had a smear campaign done against them. Those involved in these kinds of <strong>psyops</strong> (psychological operations), with the intent of destroying the victim&#8217;s life, credibility, sanity, and health, really deserve to be cursed to live the life they are consigning victims to.</p>

<p>(By the way, I misspell perpetrator as “perpetraitor” on purpose, because that is what they are: traitors who are perps)</p>
<p>If you remember a game show called &#8220;The 100,000 Dollar Pyramid&#8221;, the title of this document might give you a tiny laugh.</p>
<p>The target is sick. The target is a loser. The target is a bully (what a joke). The target was born out of wedlock, which makes them a bastard, and God doesn’t care about them anyway. The target is gay. The target is anti-gay. The target is a drug user. The target is a bum. The target is a racist. The target is a child-molester. The target is stupid. The target is a whore. The target is a slut. The target is ugly. The target is evil. The target is the devil, or a demon. The target is an MK Ultra victim, and they don’t want any witnesses. The target is “just a bitch”. The target is a pervert. The target is crazy. The target did bad things to people in the past. The target has a record. The target is a bad parent. The target eats cheesecake (that one’s just me trying to have a sense of humor about all of this). The target knows too much. The target is too old. The target is too young. The target is an embarrassment (to their cult, perhaps).</p>
<p>The accusations levied against the target may or may not be true. Many times, the target was born into this program, set up on purpose to make them look bad, after much trauma, sort of like torturing an animal and blaming the animal for reacting to being psychologically tortured and for fighting back. Often, the target is a victim of mind control, to a greater degree than the general population that is, and is being blamed for things they did as a result of a most wicked form of mind control, using trauma, among other things, and sometimes even implants.</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">WHY NONE OF THESE ARE GOOD ENOUGH EXCUSES FOR WHAT PERPETRAITORS ARE DOING TO TARGETED INDIVIDUALS:</span></b></p>
<p>The perpetraitors possibly do not know the whole truth about the individual they are destroying. They have probably been told half-truths and/or outright lies about the individual whom they are targeting. The target may have been handed off from one group of perps to the next, with each successive group being told only part of the story. Since, in many cases, the target has been a target since birth, through programs such as the Monarch Program or MK Ultra, they have been mind controlled throughout their lives, unbeknownst to them, and possibly unbeknownst to the perp as well.</p>
<p>If you are a nonconsensual human experimentee, like me, then you probably know what I am talking about. Many of you who have read my articles or watched my YouTube videos already know that I found implants in my ears in 2008. That means I have possibly been an experimentee since I was born and kept at a hospital, for the first 6 weeks of my life, in the custody of an adoption agency. This also means that anything I did while under the influence of these implants, which may indeed be cochlear implants, is directly attributable to those who are using these implants to influence my life, since I never consented to the procedure.</p>
<p>Mind Control does not equal consent.</p>
<p>However, according to these perpetraitors, I have already been judged.</p>
<p>Some of you who have been targeted are aware of something called the “Truman Show Effect”. We call it that because, as targets, we see bits and pieces of our life stories displayed in movies, music, and tell-a-vision. This leads me to the conclusion that we, the victims in this horrible and inhumane crime, are like slaves, whereby all of our intellectual property is stolen from us, and others get to profit from our suffering. It is the most disgusting crime that could ever be thought up, since the victim (so far) has no real proof, the perpetraitors have plausible deniability, and the nation denies that slavery even exists.</p>
<p>The scary part is that when I looked back over my life, I have noticed this effect going on to some degree throughout it. One example of this is the fact that when I was very young, maybe about 6 or 7, I had this thought: “What if the world around us, that we see, isn’t actually real? What if it is like some kind of movie, covering our field of vision?” I had no idea about virtual reality back then, and this was how I put the concept into words. Years later, I would see Disney come out with the 365 degree movies at Epcot. Eventually, I would see the concept in movies such as “The Matrix” and “Dark City”. It seems to me that someone<b> </b>or some group has VIP access to the collective consciousness and is able to steal from people who are held down for just such a purpose. Some of you may see how this is done on both physical and metaphysical levels.</p>
<p>Now, it seems, that is what I am seeing in this world. It is a world where we are made to believe that everyone has the same chance in life, but it is hardly the case. It has become a world where our  intellectual property is stolen, and then they sell it back to us in the form of music, movies, and tell-a-vision. What if there is a whole section of the population going through this on some level. One example would be how there are inventors who have become targeted individuals. Another would be how Renee Caisse, who invented ESSIAC Tea, had sold her idea to a pharmaceutical company that shelved it, after promising that they would research and develop her formula. Another would be how Ayn Rand died not too long after she, and the producer of the film “Atlas Shrugged”, had an argument about her wanting artistic rights to make a certain scene the way she wanted. During the argument, the producer said something like, “That’s all right, I’ll just wait until you die and make the movie how I want to”.</p>
<p>This happens all the time, although most people either don’t notice it or don’t want to admit to it. I bet that all these people writing in blogs are being stolen from, in some form or another. “We live in a wheel where everyone steals” is what I heard the band “Bush” say some time ago. I would hope that this form of slavery doesn’t last forever, because I fear it causes major problems in people’s lives, probably on a subliminal level, and they are possibly disturbed by the sense that they are being ripped off, but cannot put their finger on what is really going on. As a result of this subconscious feeling that you are being robbed, you may have emotional issues that end up affecting the way you interact with others. Eventually, this will get used against you, even though it cannot truly be blamed on you.</p>
<p>Would those who perpetrate this horrible crime on victims continue to do so if they were conscious of what we victims have been going through as a result of this legal type of slavery? Any negative karma generated by the slave happens as a direct result of living in reaction to an unknown cause of suffering, and that karma must be reaped by those who benefit from the slave’s misery of being a slave in a society that refuses to admit that slavery even exists. When someone who is not of a privileged class tries to do something that is not a typical vocation for a lower to middle class individual, they often end up becoming overtly targeted, whereas before that point, they probably didn’t notice the targeting was happening.</p>
<p>It seems to be a form of psychic vampirism, whereby the target is a victim, and the perpetraitors are the vampires. The victims are bled dry of their creative inspiration, their resources, and any of their forms of support. The targets are made to look crazy with the evil technologies being used against them, whether through the use of implants (mine are located in my ears), some form of heterodyning, occult magic, negative thought forms, directed energy weapons. I have researched enough to know they have a huge arsenal at their disposal.</p>
<p>I am led to wonder if all targets are set up since birth. Are we told a big lie about how this is the “land of the free and the home of the brave”, and how this country is about, “liberty and justice for all”, while everyone else knows the truth, but aren’t telling? Does everyone know that we are targets who were used since birth by the vampires around us? I have been told that I am a ritual sacrifice, which is why my life looks like someone upstairs was playing a big joke on me.</p>
<p>Numerology does seem to play some kind of a role in the lives of various targeted individuals I have met. Could that be how many of us are picked out at birth, possibly stolen through adoption and sold into these sick programs of covert slavery? I guarantee that if you are a REAL target, you have either the 12 or 11 in your numerology, if not both, and if not, then I bet you might have the letters AN in your name somewhere, especially if combined with a C or CH.</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Here’s what they Ought to say, to be Closer to the Truth of the Situation:</span></b></p>
<p>We traumatize you from birth, and then we blame you for not being perfect. We make you nuts, and then blame you for being that way. We steal from you on so many levels, and then blame you for feeling the need to hold onto things (which we call selfishness). We torture your mind, and then blame you for reacting to it. We steal your intellectual property, and then blame you for feeling disturbed. We ruin your life, and then blame you for not being able to make your way in the world. We turn your whole life upside-down, and then blame you for being negative. We cause you physical and mental problems, but then deny you disability. We program you from birth, and then blame you for not being what you were supposed to be, had we not messed with your head in the first place. (And in my case) We make you spend half your childhood in a house of mirrors, and then blame you for being a narcissist. (Also in my case) We place every importance on your body as a woman, and then blame you for being too focused on your body.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, this is the world of the double bind, designed to cause cognitive dissonance in those who are the designated sacrifices. Problem, Reaction Solution: They cause the problem in you, and then demonize you for your reaction, and the apparent solution is torturing you to death.</p>
<p>I even heard one of them tell me that we are just food to them. Let them reap that karma, all of it, including any karma caused as a result of what the target has most likely been put through since birth.</p>

		<h3 class="result"><a href="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/01/07/occulttechno/" rel="bookmark">Occult &amp; Technological Practices Used on&nbsp;TIs</a></h3>					<p>For those of you who see how there is a bigger, occult picture to the plight of <strong>targeted individuals (TI)</strong>, I ask you to read this with an open mind, and please bear with me, as I know I am repeating a few things I have stated in other posts. This post is about the occult and technological practices used on me and other targeted individuals. I will come out with another post soon, God willing, breaking down this stuff, in a list, in separate groups, under a new heading.</p>
<p>After doing some research, due to my own unfortunate situation of being an <strong>unwitting test subject</strong> with actual implants (that anyone can see &amp; feel), I have discovered that this nation has a history of doing <strong>unethical experiments</strong> on unwitting victims. If you were adopted, this may be the case for you.</p>
<p>From Wikipedia:</p>
<p>&#8220;Many of these tests were performed on children, the sick, and mentally disabled individuals, often under the guise of &#8220;medical treatment&#8221;. In many of the studies, a large portion of the subjects were poor, racial minorities, or prisoners.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_experimentation_in_the_United_States">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_experimentation_in_the_United_States</a></p>
<p>I am struck by the numbers of seemingly intelligent people who deny what has been happening to me, even after I show them the implants in my head. Given the placement of these implants (as shown below), I am saddened by my current situation of being a &#8220;<strong>scapegoat</strong>&#8220;.</p>

<p>After doing some research into adoption scandals, it becomes glaringly obvious that I have been used as an experiment for some very evil, disgusting people, &amp; that I was possibly <strong>stolen</strong> from my mother <strong>at birth</strong>, she being told that I was dead, especially when you consider the fact that I was held in custody of this agency for the first six weeks of my life before being placed into an adoptive family, even though my birthmother was supposedly matched up with my adoptive mother long before I was born.</p>
<p><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2011/10/spains-stolen-babies-an-ugly-past-on-a-staggering-scale-2/">http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2011/10/spains-stolen-babies-an-ugly-past-on-a-staggering-scale-2/</a></p>
<p>Although I have tried to contact the agency I was adopted through, I have not yet received a response. Is it that hard for someone to believe that I might have been stolen from my mother at birth, to be used for this hideous program of implantation with <strong>RFID</strong>s &amp; <strong>mind control</strong>?</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_international_adoption_scandals">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_international_adoption_scandals</a></p>
<p>Considering the fact that the system in place, which allows for these experiments to take place, is and always has been heavily involved in <strong>occult</strong> and evil practices, whereby they seem to like to &#8220;<strong>play God</strong>&#8220;, so to speak, how can I keep my mouth shut?</p>
<p>I am now the unfortunate recipient of voices through these implants, which tell me that I am a <strong>ritual sacrifice</strong>, that I was engineered to <a href="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpthoth.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="221" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2012/09/11/symbolism-mind-control-and-metaphysical-sabotage-in-relation-to-archetypal-transference-and-the-second-commandment-of-the-decalogue/12thtrumpthoth-7/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpthoth.jpg" data-orig-size="184,270" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="12thtrumpthoth" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpthoth.jpg?w=184" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpthoth.jpg?w=184" class="alignright size-full wp-image-221" alt="12th Trump from the Thoth Tarot Deck" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpthoth.jpg?w=540" srcset="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpthoth.jpg 184w, https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/12thtrumpthoth.jpg?w=102 102w" sizes="(max-width: 184px) 100vw, 184px"   /></a>born on <strong>12/12</strong> to be that sacrifice, and tell me exactly how my life was ruined through, not only  through the use of these blasted implants (I am trying not to cuss), not only through the use of mind control via tell-a-vision, movies, and mu-sic, but also through the rampant and uncontrolled use of <strong>symbolism</strong> in <strong>astrology</strong> &amp; <strong>tarot</strong>, which are<strong> archetypes</strong> that infect the <strong>collective consciousness</strong>, &amp; the individual&#8217;s <strong>subconscious</strong>, in the form of <strong>memes</strong>. In my case, as seen in the Crowley-Harris Thoth deck&#8217;s 12th trump, I was not only hanging upsidedown from an Egyptian heiroglyph meaning life, but a serpent is attached to my head. I have heard that <strong>Crowley</strong> was an MI6 agent, and a known satanist. Notice that the figure is also unconscious and has hardly any mouth. Could this have something to do with why so many people ignore me? By the way, many of you who know me, know that <strong>mu</strong>=&#8221;12th letter of the greek alphabet&#8221;, and <strong>sic</strong>=&#8221;as intentionally so written&#8221;. Wouldn&#8217;t a person in this metaphysical position have serious issues? It&#8217;s a miracle I didn&#8217;t end up worse than I am. The upsidedown triangle in the lower right of the card indicates that the victim is female. It seems I have been framed.</p>

<p>So, I cannot help but feel as if I am being punished for my actions in this life, which were directly affected by all of the things mentioned above, and therefore, I feel the need to defend myself.</p>
<p>I am now the target for all the things that TIs talk about regarding the torture I experience on a daily basis. I get the pinpricks, the itching, the burning, the constant pain, the gang-stalking, street-theater routine, and I have to watch as bits &amp; pieces of my own story get played out in the various forms of media (tell-a-vision, mu-sic, &amp; movies), as do many victims (I have heard one other TI call this the &#8220;Truman Show Effect&#8221;). This is apparently how victims are farmed for the creative inspiration that naturally results from living in a state of severe but unspeakable <strong>oppression</strong>. They&#8217;ve got this down to a science, folks.</p>
<p>Of course, when I try to put videos out about it, I get the <strong>online harassment</strong> from some very cruel and heartless people who cannot possibly think I am crazy when I only posted about my implants and the history of how RFIDs have been used as early as the 1950s, by people like <strong>Dr. Jose Delgado</strong>, which is a well known fact, &amp; quite easy to research. The fact that I posted a video about my RFIDs &amp; not 15 minutes later, was attacked by at least 20 commenters, lets me know that there are indeed, <strong>disinfo agents</strong> out there, just waiting for the chance to earn a few bucks by attacking a target who is speaking the truth. <strong>Discrediting the victim</strong> is a huge part of their wicked, perverted game.</p>
<p>Here is one other example of how a disinfo agent might work. My youtube user name is the same name I have on this site (<strong>musicis2words</strong>). On youtube, not long after I began to make videos, I saw a user with the moniker, &#8220;ignoramusky&#8221;, as in &#8220;ignore-a-mu-ski&#8221;. Is that a joke? Is he getting paid to do that? Must be quite a cushy job. Or how about the job of those who are tasked with the responsibility of surgically mutilating another individual? How are they able to live with themselves, anyway?</p>
<p>I am sadly reminded of the infamous <strong>Stanley Milgram</strong> experiment where people were willing to administer shocks to others, even to the point of causing heart pain, simply because they were told to.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment</a></p>
<p>In the end of it all, I am all too aware of how my <strong>freewill was stolen</strong> from me at birth, and on both physical (implants) and metaphysical (archetypes) levels. Since this is no longer deniable, as I am sure my stalkers are well aware, it becomes very difficult for me to live with the day-to-day degrading and humiliating messages coming from stalkers, both online, in person, and via synthetic telepathy through these implants.</p>
<p>The fact remains that, in my head, at each ear, is <strong>damning evidence</strong> against those who willingly put implants in my head to control my thoughts, emotions, and even my behavior; and in the tarot and astrology is damning evidence that there are indeed occultist elites, running the world, who set individuals like me up, to be made to do things against our will, which makes them directly responsible. I believe this is why I am being tortured. I think they want me dead before I can prove, on a larger scale, what was done to me.</p>
<p>All my life, I felt this absence of higher power, or God. When I was a little girl, I loved <strong>God</strong>, and wanted to serve Him. The bible says that God grantd human beings freewill, but I am saying that humans have taken away a large measure of freewill just through the &#8220;<strong>graven images</strong>&#8221; (images that have become <strong>engraven</strong> into the collective consciousness) of the tarot and astrology, among other things. The bible says that God loves the<strong> truth</strong>, but I have found it increasingly difficult to get anyone to see the truth about what was done to me. What in the world is going on here?</p>
<p>Could I be correct in my attributing the <strong>upsidedown</strong> nature of our world today to the fact that we are living in years surrounding 2012, and the <strong>12th trump</strong> of the tarot is an upsidedown figure in most decks (of which there are over 1,000)? Did those who invented the tarot make that card like that on purpose? Getting it in a reading is supposed to mean &#8220;<strong>redemption through sacrifice</strong>&#8220;, and although my life sure has seemed like one big sacrifice, I have yet to find redemption, in the biblical sense of the term. To me this card is a misuse of what is known as &#8220;<strong>the butterfly effect</strong>&#8220;, whereby a repetion of a vibration increases its amplification.</p>
<p>Okay, so I am ranting now, but everything that I have discovered over the past four and a half years have led me to this point. I so desperately want for the real God, the one who loves each and every one of His creations, to see the truth, and to stop letting me be blamed, and to stop letting me be used, abused, and killed in the process. It&#8217;s no wonder that someone in my position would feel this way. I am accused of all sorts of things that are patently false, as well as some things I am responsible for. However, if I was mind controlled my whole entire life, how can I be blamed? I mean, its not just the archetypal memes, the TV, music, or movies, but it is also <strong>mind control via implants</strong>, which is the most insidious form of mind control I can think of.</p>
<p>It was in 2008 that I discovered the implants, and ever since I have heard audible voices, but for how long was someone &#8220;whispering in my ears&#8221; before I became aware of these things? The idea that a person will not do something under hypnosis that they are not willing to do while conscious has been disproven, so it should be obvious that until I became aware of what was happening, I had been living under a state of <strong>post-hypnotic suggstion</strong>.</p>
<p>For many TIs, life seems like a world where you are the butt of a humungous joke that, until now, everyone has been aware of, but you&#8230; and the joke is, suprise, you&#8217;re being sacrificed! What if this was engineered the whole time that the TI has been living? Would the so-called &#8220;<strong>higher self</strong>&#8221; somehow know this, and have serious issues throughout life because of it?</p>
<p>If you are a TI, I ask you to see if you have the 12 in your <strong>numerology</strong>. It may explain much. Many TIs I have met either have the 12 in their numerology, or they are double digit birthdates.</p>
<p>Another commonality is that many female TIs have some form of the name &#8220;Anne&#8221;, either as a first or middle name. Imagine my suprise on a TI forum, when I saw the moderator&#8217;s email was &#8220;anna-advocate&#8221;, but her group name was &#8220;Jo-Jo-Jive&#8221;. I could just be reading into it, but after what I have been through, I am sensitized to this kind of thing. For example, having initials that spell &#8220;cat&#8221; is used to dehumanize me by my stalkers, but when I looked back on my life and remembered how a woman with the last name &#8220;skinner&#8221; was able to steal and use my ideas, being reminded of the phrase &#8220;skin the cat&#8221;, I am again made to feel like my life is a cruel joke.</p>
<p>It is really just <strong>covert slavery</strong>, which is worse than regular slavery, because the enslaver won&#8217;t even admit that it is happening.</p>
<p>May all TIs find relief from this <strong>heinous crime</strong>.</p>
