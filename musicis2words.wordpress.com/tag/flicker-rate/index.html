<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Trauma and Its Effects on the Psyche/Spirit</strong>  </span></p>
<p>(Links to resources at bottom of article)</p>
<p>Most people these days understand that <em>trauma</em> has <em>psychological effects</em>. If you&#8217;ve been reading my other articles, then you understand that the word <em>psyche</em> derives from both Greek and Latin words that refer to &#8220;<em>spirit</em>&#8220;.</p>
<p><strong><em>Psychology</em> is therefore, the study of the <em>psyche</em> or <em>spirit</em>. </strong></p>
<p><em>Trauma</em> in childhood is recognized in the psychological community as having a negative impact on behavior, causing things like PTSD, Depression, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Borderline Personality Disorder, Antisocial Personality Disorder, Paranoid Personality Disorder, and Schizoid Personality Disorder, to name a few. I suspect that the more trauma a person has in their life, whether in childhood or adulthood, the more problems will manifest in their <em>psyche</em> (<em>spirit</em>), and in their behavior, causing them to be prescribed multiple psych drugs over their lifetimes.</p>
<p>Is this some sort of a formula or what?</p>
<p>While I do have some strong misgivings about the discipline of psychology and their over-emphasis on drugs for behavioral disorders, when there are no real objective tests for most of these disorders, this does not make <em>psychology</em> an invalid science&#8230; just a flawed &amp; corrupted one, in need of more thorough oversight in the community, since it seems like the whole discipline has fallen into the hands of big pharma.</p>
<p>People with <em>PTSD</em> have been found to have elevated stress hormones (cortisol) which can lead to heart disease, and also to the shrinkage of the hippocampus (which affects the transfer of facts from short-term to long-term memory).</p>
<p><strong>Trauma &amp; Circumcision:</strong></p>
<p>After doing some research on the subject of <em>trauma &amp; PTSD</em>, I have noticed that the most common groups studied in relation to this are veterans &amp; children. I find it interesting that no one seems to be studying the effects of trauma in infancy. I realize that this may be more difficult to get anecdotal information from infants, however, one could measure the amounts of cortisol in the brain before &amp; after a <em>circumcision</em>, for example, or before and after a child is taken from its natural mother during the adoption process.</p>
<p>I mention circumcision because it is the mutilation of a male child&#8217;s penis, usually done immediately after birth, unless the child is an orthodox Jew, who will get this done at 13 years old, viewing it as a &#8220;rite of passage&#8221;. When I consider circumcision, I cannot help but consider the long term psychological impact of this practice on a newborn baby. Sadly, the families who allow it &amp; the doctors who perform it apparently do not question the ramifications of this wicked trauma done on a newborn. I think this is why so many males don&#8217;t question going off to war&#8230; they&#8217;ve already been prepped with violence.</p>
<p>Circumcision is a physical assault on the most sensitive part of a male child&#8217;s body, which then makes it a violation of the psyche as well. If considered in combination with the existence of the chakras, this mutilation of an organ in the <em>root chakra</em> has affects on emotions involving <em>security</em> needs. <em>Trauma</em> at such a young age, whether through circumcision or through the unceremonious routines of measuring &amp; weighing, blood testing, a vitamin K shot, vaccines, &amp; drops or ointment in the eyes, would seem to have some sort of emotional impact on the <em>psyche</em> of a newborn baby that is supposed to be experiencing its first few hours bonding with its mother.</p>
<p><strong>About the root chakra:</strong> &#8220;<em>The root chakra is responsible for your sense of belonging, safety, and security in the world</em>.  It’s main concern is <em>survival of the self</em>. (Emphasis Mine) The health of our blood, immune system, bones, joints and spine is dependent on the emotions associated with this chakra. It envelops the body’s basic needs for safety, money, sexuality, groundedness and boundaries.  People who have trouble with their first chakra may not have developed a strong identity and have not discovered their life purpose.  If they are too yin they may be ungrounded.  If they are too yang there might be too much attachment to material things, too much self-indulgence and a preoccupation with satisfaction of their own needs.&#8221;  &#8211; from naturalhealthtechniques.com (link below)</p>
<p>So any trauma in early infancy would naturally have effects on the root chakra, causing security issues in the psyche, which then ripens them up to be conditioned into good little consumers, who are very needy, and often greedy.</p>
<p>Circumcision would of course have the strongest impact of all the &#8220;routine&#8221; procedures done to a newborn after birth. Have you ever seen a circumcision on a newborn baby? The one I saw was awful, &amp; proved to me that babies do feel pain, regardless of what the doctor may tell you. The question is, what are the long term effects of such a traumatic procedure on an infant&#8217;s psyche?</p>
<p>It is my feeling that trauma in infancy &amp; early childhood has a tendency to soften up the mind &amp; make people more easily controlled by the <em>societal conditioning</em>, which is in turn, controlled by the so-called &#8220;<em>hidden hand</em>&#8221; (corporate elites), through the use of education, religion, television, movies, music, literature, &amp; yes, even through the use of <em>brain implants</em>, on par with the research of people like <em>Dr. Jose Delgado</em> &amp; <em>Dr. Ewen Cameron</em>. It sets in the newborn&#8217;s mind, a state of shock, coloring almost everything that happens shortly after birth, including the bonding experience with the parents. I suspect that the traumatized brain of an infant or young child is much more easily hypnotized by the flicker-rate of the television, which is known to induce a trance-like state in those who watch it.</p>
<p><strong>Trauma &amp; Adoption:</strong></p>
<p>There are other traumas that occur during infancy, such as <em>adoption</em>. Now recognized as a traumatic experience by many metal health professionals, with life-long consequences, adoption has a deep psychological impact on the child, leading to a disproportionate number of adoptees seeking help for mental health issues. Adoptees often end up with various forms of attachment disorder, addictions, depression, &amp; obsessive behaviors, to name a few.</p>
<p>While the damage from the aforementioned traumas may have already been done to the psyche, &amp; while some of these people do need medication for the deep psychological issues caused by these events in order to be functional, would it not make perfect sense to examine evidence (measuring cortisol) that is now available with relation to <em>trauma &amp; its effects on the brain</em>?</p>
<p><strong>Trauma Based Mind Control:</strong></p>
<p>Most people who have done any research into the subject of <em>trauma-based mind control</em> understand that it is a powerful way to alter the mind. The more sensational cases of people, like Cathy O&#8217;Brien or Brice Taylor, speak of the splitting of the mind into <em>multiple personalities</em> through the use of trauma. <strong>I contend that the creation of MPD in a person is not necessary for mind control to be achieved</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Learned Helplessness:</strong></p>
<p>Evidence of this concept can be found in the way the American public mostly sat back &amp; watched as their freedoms were eroded in the years following September 11th, 2001. Had they not been repeatedly exposed to the trauma of the event at the World Trade Center, would it have been as easy for those in power to erode American liberties? Does the fact that the United States has been at war for so many years now have a general impact on the <em>collective psyche</em> of its inhabitants, a population which was raised on television? Is it possible that trauma delivered on such a large scale has anchored trauma in infancy or childhood, &amp; induced a state of <em>learned helplessness</em>?</p>
<p>&#8220;The concept of learned helplessness was discovered accidentally by psychologists Martin Seligman and Steven F. Maier. They had initially observed helpless behavior in dogs that were classically conditioned to expect an electrical shock after hearing a tone. Later, the dogs were placed in a shuttlebox that contained two chambers separated by a low barrier. The floor was electrified on one side, and not on the other. The dogs previously subjected to the classical conditioning made no attempts to escape, even though avoiding the shock simply involved jumping over a low barrier.&#8221; &#8211; from psychology.about.com (link below)</p>
<p>The above study was done in 1967.</p>
<p>Please reread that above paragraph &amp; let the information sink in. It shows that <em>repeated trauma</em> can induce a state of <em>learned helplessness</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Trauma &amp; Television in Conditioning:</strong></p>
<p>Traumatize a baby &amp; then sit it in front of the television for a while. Most people go into a sort of trance when watching television anyway, due to the <em>flicker-rate</em> (aka &#8220;refresh-rate&#8221;) effect. Since the child&#8217;s mind is like a sponge, it will suck up all the programming you want. Granted, this is a highly contested statement about television <em>programming</em>, however, it should be considered that, at the very least, watching TV can put a person into a hypnotic, trance-like state, causing things being said to them afterwards to have the possibility of becoming a <em>post-hypnotic suggestion</em>. Hence, advertising.</p>
<p>Let me illustrate this idea: Let&#8217;s say you are a 13 year old kid, watching a couple of hours of TV before bed. Right after you turn that TV off, you hear your dad complaining that you didn&#8217;t take the trash out or get the mail. He gets angry &amp; says that you&#8217;re stupid a number of times. Does this statement that you are stupid have an increased possibility of becoming a <em>self-fulfilling prophecy</em> because you were just in a trance for the past 2 hours before hearing it? Would there be a difference in the effect depending on whether you experienced trauma in infancy or early childhood? Could this have something to do with the reason many victims of mind control programs cite the <em>ritual drowning</em> at 3 years old as being one of their experiences?</p>
<p>It seems to me that trauma has as one of its effects a type of <em>fracture</em> <em>of the psyche</em> or spirit. Setting newborn babies up in this way has caused most of us to end up with an unnatural state of need &amp; insecurity, which is then played on by all sorts of advertising making people desire things they do not need. It also has, as an unfortunate (but possibly intended) side effect: a tendency to cause symptoms such as obsessions, attention deficit disorders, depression, hoarding, paranoia, eating disorders, drug &amp; alcohol addiction, shopping addictions, social anxiety, &amp; other behaviors categorized as <em>mental dysfunction</em>. In reality, these behavioral problems are merely a reaction to adverse stimuli that has occurred since birth, &amp; in some cases, over the course of a lifetime.</p>
<p><strong>Natural Trauma: </strong></p>
<p>There are plenty of traumas that are natural aspects of life. These include birth, loss of a parent, injuries, etc. These natural traumas may cause some issues with the psyche, but they will be healed over time. The problem is that there are so many orchestrated &amp; manipulated traumas in a person&#8217;s life these days, including the examples I mentioned above, that the psyche never gets a real chance to heal.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion: </strong></p>
<p>Between trauma in infancy &amp; early childhood, and trauma witnessed in the news every day, it becomes clear to see an atmosphere of terror is causing these mental/emotional/spiritual issues to manifest in people. The event of what happened to the <em>World Trade Center</em> marked a turning point in traumatizing the masses to allow those with power to enslave the people in such a way, that they would not even recognize their slavery.</p>
<p>Is it any wonder that so many people these days are running to the psych doctor for medication to alleviate their symptoms?</p>
<p>Is it any wonder that people have allowed their civil liberties to be eroded, given the discovery of learned helplessness as related to trauma? This has been going on longer than anyone realizes, &amp; has far reaching implications.</p>

<p><strong>Trauma and Its Effects on the Psyche/Spirit</strong></p>
<p>(Links to resources at bottom of article)</p>
<p>Most people these days understand that <em>trauma</em> has <em>psychological effects</em>. If you&#8217;ve been reading my other articles, then you understand that the word <em>psyche</em> derives from both Greek and Latin words that refer to &#8220;<em>spirit</em>&#8220;.</p>
<p><strong><em>Psychology</em> is therefore, the study of the <em>psyche</em> or <em>spirit</em>. </strong></p>
<p><em>Trauma</em> in childhood is recognized in the psychological community as having a negative impact on behavior, causing things like PTSD, Depression, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Borderline Personality Disorder, Antisocial Personality Disorder, Paranoid Personality Disorder, and Schizoid Personality Disorder, to name a few. I suspect that the more trauma a person has in their life, whether in childhood or adulthood, the more problems will manifest in their <em>psyche</em> (<em>spirit</em>), and in their behavior, causing them to be prescribed multiple psych drugs over their lifetimes.</p>
<p>Is this some sort of a formula or what?</p>
<p>While I do have some strong misgivings about the discipline of psychology and their over-emphasis on drugs for behavioral disorders, when there are no real objective tests for most of these disorders, this does not make <em>psychology</em> an invalid science&#8230; just a flawed &amp; corrupted one, in need of more thorough oversight in the community, since it seems like the whole discipline has fallen into the hands of big pharma.</p>
<p>People with <em>PTSD</em> have been found to have elevated stress hormones (cortisol) which can lead to heart disease, and also to the shrinkage of the hippocampus (which affects the transfer of facts from short-term to long-term memory).</p>
<p><strong>Trauma &amp; Circumcision:</strong></p>
<p>After doing some research on the subject of <em>trauma &amp; PTSD</em>, I have noticed that the most common groups studied in relation to this are veterans &amp; children. I find it interesting that no one seems to be studying the effects of trauma in infancy. I realize that this may be more difficult to get anecdotal information from infants, however, one could measure the amounts of cortisol in the brain before &amp; after a <em>circumcision</em>, for example, or before and after a child is taken from its natural mother during the adoption process.</p>
<p>I mention circumcision because it is the mutilation of a male child&#8217;s penis, usually done immediately after birth, unless the child is an orthodox Jew, who will get this done at 13 years old, viewing it as a &#8220;rite of passage&#8221;. When I consider circumcision, I cannot help but consider the long term psychological impact of this practice on a newborn baby. Sadly, the families who allow it &amp; the doctors who perform it apparently do not question the ramifications of this wicked trauma done on a newborn. I think this is why so many males don&#8217;t question going off to war&#8230; they&#8217;ve already been prepped with violence.</p>
<p>Circumcision is a physical assault on the most sensitive part of a male child&#8217;s body, which then makes it a violation of the psyche as well. If considered in combination with the existence of the chakras, this mutilation of an organ in the <em>root chakra</em> has affects on emotions involving <em>security</em> needs. <em>Trauma</em> at such a young age, whether through circumcision or through the unceremonious routines of measuring &amp; weighing, blood testing, a vitamin K shot, vaccines, &amp; drops or ointment in the eyes, would seem to have some sort of emotional impact on the <em>psyche</em> of a newborn baby that is supposed to be experiencing its first few hours bonding with its mother.</p>
<p><strong>About the root chakra:</strong> &#8220;<em>The root chakra is responsible for your sense of belonging, safety, and security in the world</em>.  It’s main concern is <em>survival of the self</em>. (Emphasis Mine) The health of our blood, immune system, bones, joints and spine is dependent on the emotions associated with this chakra. It envelops the body’s basic needs for safety, money, sexuality, groundedness and boundaries.  People who have trouble with their first chakra may not have developed a strong identity and have not discovered their life purpose.  If they are too yin they may be ungrounded.  If they are too yang there might be too much attachment to material things, too much self-indulgence and a preoccupation with satisfaction of their own needs.&#8221;  &#8211; from naturalhealthtechniques.com (link below)</p>
<p>So any trauma in early infancy would naturally have effects on the root chakra, causing security issues in the psyche, which then ripens them up to be good little consumers, who are very needy, and often greedy.</p>
<p>Circumcision would of course have the strongest impact of all the &#8220;routine&#8221; procedures done to a newborn after birth. Have you ever seen a circumcision on a newborn baby? The one I saw was awful, &amp; proved to me that babies do feel pain, regardless of what the doctor may tell you. The question is, what are the long term effects of such a traumatic procedure on an infant&#8217;s psyche?</p>
<p>It is my feeling that trauma in infancy &amp; early childhood has a tendency to soften up the mind &amp; make people more easily controlled by the <em>societal conditioning</em>, which is in turn, controlled by the so-called &#8220;<em>hidden hand</em>&#8221; (corporate elites), through the use of education, religion, television, movies, music, literature, &amp; yes, even through the use of <em>brain implants</em>, on par with the research of people like <em>Dr. Jose Delgado</em> &amp; <em>Dr. Ewen Cameron</em>. It sets in the newborn&#8217;s mind, a state of shock, coloring almost everything that happens shortly after birth, including the bonding experience with the parents. I suspect that the traumatized brain of an infant or young child is much more easily hypnotized by the flicker-rate of the television, which is known to induce a trance-like state in those who watch it.</p>
<p><strong>Trauma &amp; Adoption:</strong></p>
<p>There are other traumas that occur during infancy, such as <em>adoption</em>. Now recognized as a traumatic experience by many metal health professionals, with life-long consequences, adoption has a deep psychological impact on the child, leading to a disproportionate number of adoptees seeking help for mental health issues. Adoptees often end up with various forms of attachment disorder, addictions, depression, &amp; obsessive behaviors, to name a few.</p>
<p>While the damage from the aforementioned traumas may have already been done to the psyche, &amp; while some of these people do need medication for the deep psychological issues caused by these events in order to be functional, would it not make perfect sense to examine evidence (measuring cortisol) that is now available with relation to <em>trauma &amp; its effects on the brain</em>?</p>
<p><strong>Trauma Based Mind Control:</strong></p>
<p>Most people who have done any research into the subject of <em>trauma-based mind control</em> understand that it is a powerful way to alter the mind. The more sensational cases of people, like Cathy O&#8217;Brien or Brice Taylor, speak of the splitting of the mind into <em>multiple personalities</em> through the use of trauma. <strong>I contend that the creation of MPD in a person is not necessary for mind control to be achieved</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Learned Helplessness:</strong></p>
<p>Evidence of this concept can be found in the way the American public mostly sat back &amp; watched as their freedoms were eroded in the years following September 11th, 2001. Had they not been repeatedly exposed to the trauma of the event at the World Trade Center, would it have been as easy for those in power to erode American liberties? Does the fact that the United States has been at war for so many years now have a general impact on the <em>collective psyche</em> of its inhabitants, a population which was raised on television? Is it possible that trauma delivered on such a large scale has anchored trauma in infancy or childhood, &amp; induced a state of <em>learned helplessness</em>?</p>

Some say aliens are responsible. Some people say it is demonic in nature &amp; accepting Jesus Christ as your personal savior is the only way to find relief. Some say this phenomena is &#8220;<strong>cause stalking</strong>&#8221; by a group of people who have <strong>judged</strong> the victim<strong> in absentia</strong>. Even still, there are those people, like some bloggers, who say it is something like &#8220;a godlike entity manipulating humanity&#8221;. I even read where one blogger overheard his handlers referring to him as &#8220;<strong>the sacrifice</strong>&#8220;.</p>
<p>As a victim of this, it becomes very difficult to know what the actual truth is. I am harassed with voices, directed conversation, pain, some sort of radiation hits in the chest, crotch, head, to the point where I honestly don&#8217;t understand what is happening. I am not alone in this, as I have read &amp; seen many other victims of this horrendous crime speak out about the exact same things. One begins to wonder if God is really a cruel entity allowing these things to go on, or worse, causing them, which is something I really <em>don&#8217;t want</em> to believe. If I am wrong about this, then I beg forgiveness, but I am confused about this issue.</p>

In my case, however, the very visible &amp; obvious <strong>implants</strong> in my ears make it all to clear that someone has been controlling me throughout my life. Since it is well-known that <strong>Dr. Jose Delgado</strong> was doing his research into <strong>brain stimulation</strong> with implants back in the 1950s &amp; for at least 20 years, it is not hard to imagine that I might&#8217;ve been sold into this &#8220;<strong>program</strong>&#8221; as a baby, through adoption. I have noticed that there is a predominance of adoptees &amp; foster kids who are victims, who blog &amp; vlog about this horrible situation. This is telling.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m so sorry for those who are suffering through this. <em>No one deserves it</em>, especially when you consider the overarching problem at the root of all of this. The problem that I see is that mind control has been happening on some level, for centuries at least. Mind control, by definition, <em>removes</em> freewill, &amp; there are many ways in which mind control is used to subtly influence people. The <strong>flicker rate</strong> of tv &amp; movies alone is enough to hypnotize people, especially children. Any <strong>subliminal messages</strong> in movies or television, such as hidden <strong>symbolism</strong>, access the <strong>subconscious mind</strong> directly, especially while people are in a <strong>trance</strong>. It is the manipulation of the human mind, which again, removes freewill.</p>
<p>It does seem that <strong>trauma</strong> plays a role in how much of an impact mind control has on an individual. It is now professionally recognized that adoption is a trauma for the baby, so it stands to reason that being placed in foster care, or any separation of a child from it&#8217;s natural parents would then also be traumatic. What about other traumas that occur in infancy &amp; early childhood? Like the near drowning at 3 years old, cited by so many ritual abuse victims? How about circumcision at birth? What about the onslaught of tests, immunizations, goo in the eyes, separation from mother, endured by most newborns born in hospitals? Could it be that these early traumas have a purpose beyond what is stated regarding the reasons for what is cited above?</p>

We were totally <strong>brainwashed</strong>. I can only imagine how many veterans (who were programed to be heroes, via TV &amp; movies) are now being mentally harassed, blamed for everything they might&#8217;ve done during wartime. I say this because I know that I am constantly blamed for things in my past, even though it is clear that <em>I never truly had freewill</em> in my life, do to the many ways in which I was affected by mind control.</p>
<p><strong>I have observed multiple ways a &#8220;system&#8221; can exert mind control over it&#8217;s population:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1) Religion</strong>&#8211; Religion has a long history of being used to control the masses. Children are brought up in a religion &amp; know nothing else. Most of these religions are pagan in origin, but vehemently deny that fact, &amp; then carry on with obvious pagan traditions. This would naturally cause a conflict in a child&#8217;s mind. The bible warns that &#8220;Christians would be persecuted in the so-called &#8220;end times&#8221;. Is it a coincidence that I know a fellow TI who&#8217;s name is &#8220;Christian&#8221;? I doubt it.</p>
<p><strong>2) Education</strong>&#8211; The educational system in the US especially, has a specific slanted point of view. If a child does not internalize this point of view, they end up with poor grades &amp; labeled as losers.</p>
<p><strong>3) Parenting</strong>&#8211; Parents have a specific point of view &amp; want their children at least to understand it, but some parents enforce their point of view on their children. But worse than this is the fact that some parents simply leave their kids alone most of the time, only giving negative attention to them. This is a form of <em>negative programming</em>.</p>
<p><strong>4) Media (TV, movies, music, talk radio, etc.)-</strong> Growing up with the mass media, I can attest to the fact that it shaped my beliefs, especially since I had negative programming from my own parents, &amp; was mostly left alone by them. Television was my primary baby sitter. There are subliminals in movies &amp; television to be sure, but also in music. Some messages are in the form of cleverly hidden artwork or backwards masking, but others can be found in the themes, which get repeated over &amp; over in multiple movies &amp; stories viewed by adults &amp; children alike. As I&#8217;ve seen others point out, there is a reason why they call it &#8220;television programming&#8221;. There are those who will vehemently deny that subliminal programming exists, even when it is right in your face (see <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmMnnOr-lYQ"><br /> Subliminal Sex Messages and Pornography in Advertising and Cartoons </a>). However, the flicker rate of television &amp; movies alone is enough to put people in a trance, especially when in front of the big-screen. Ever notice how large tv screens are these days? And why all that push for people to get HDTV even to the point of giving away free converters to people? Ever since that happened, it sure seems like things changed really quickly. It is like Orwell&#8217;s <strong>1984</strong>, just a little bit different.</p>
<p><strong>5) Language</strong>&#8211; If you take a good, hard look at the English language, you will find negative root words in many other words &amp; proper names. I have a video on this, called <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMe5Y4Hs_7c">&#8220;Mind Control Using Symbolism in Language and Numbers&#8221;</a>. A couple of examples though: how many words can you find with the root words mar, war, ill, or ow in them? This attests to how society, which learns language very young, is controlled by a very negative base program. There is this symbolism inherent in our language, some of it is visual (reading), while some of it is phonetic (hearing). You might consider your own name &amp; how you might&#8217;ve been treated by others throughout your life based on it.</p>
<p><strong>6) Controlled Opposition Groups</strong>&#8211; These are groups formed with the specific intent of controlling any opposition to the &#8220;system&#8221; (i.e. cult-ure or society). They are often, but not exclusively, from other countries, coming over to the US to alert people to the existence of mind control. Then, when people begin to wake up, they are targeted by the system that wants to defend its existence. They use mind control techniques such as NLP (neuro-linguistic programming) to give them a powerful influence on people.</p>
<p><strong>7)</strong> <strong>Occult Practices</strong>&#8211; Mind Control has been going on at least since the Pharos in Egypt, but more likely, it goes back to the Druids. They&#8217;ve been using drugs &amp; hypnotism for centuries, possibly much longer, and believe it or not, black magic &amp; voodoo are also involved. They are pushing forth an intent to influence individuals &amp; society as a whole, using <strong>meta-physical technologies</strong>, the knowledge of which has been passed down through their generations, the result of which has effects on the spirit of a person. Psyche comes from a Greek word referring to the spirit. Knowing the psychology of human beings allows for a greater influence over them.</p>
<p><strong>8)</strong> <strong>Implants &amp; Other Physical Technologies</strong>&#8211; When I consider the work of Nazi scientists &amp; the fact that the US brought them to this country under &#8220;<strong>Project Paperclip</strong>&#8221; to continue their experiments, it becomes extremely difficult for me to ignore the possibility that people are actually sold into programs of mind control experimentation, sometimes by their own parents. Technologies such as brain implants (see Dr. Jose Delgado&#8217;s work in the 1950s &amp; 60s), are used to completely wreck a person&#8217;s life or to enhance it.</p>
<p>The positive implications for mind control make it absolutely disgusting that they are using it to influence so many people in such negative ways. I mean, they could use it to help people quit smoking, for example, or to make people more successful &amp; therefore allow them to make better contributions to the world. So, why wouldn&#8217;t they?</p>
<p>It is my theory that those who are responsible for the most intense aspects of mind control, such as implants, do actually use<img data-attachment-id="924" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/07/04/mind-control-and-the-targeted-individual/goldendawn/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/goldendawn.jpg" data-orig-size="200,282" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="goldendawn" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/goldendawn.jpg?w=200" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/goldendawn.jpg?w=200" class="alignright  wp-image-924" alt="goldendawn" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/goldendawn.jpg?w=128&#038;h=181" width="128" height="181" srcset="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/goldendawn.jpg?w=128&amp;h=181 128w, https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/goldendawn.jpg?w=106&amp;h=150 106w, https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/goldendawn.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 128px) 100vw, 128px" /> it for positive purposes, but only on pre-designated people (i.e. the ones they can control the most), while for others (the ones they deem as the &#8220;losers&#8221;), it is used to keep that class of people down. It seems that they are keeping a balance by doing this: one group is brought to new heights, while the other is brought to extreme lows.</p>

The hexagram is prominently displayed in the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, &amp; it is also used in Theosophy. Both of these organizations, among others, are so-called &#8220;Secret Societies&#8221;, who, like the Freemasons, allow only those at the very top of the hierarchy to know the full truth of their methods &amp; practices, and what their role is in society at large. The hexagram is only one example of a <em>meta-physical technology</em>.</p>
<p>Those who are TIs are suffering as a result of being put at the pinnacle of an upside-down triangle, while their &#8220;chosen ones&#8221; are placed at the top.</p>
<p>It is also my theory that the ones who are held down, throughout their lives are then used for the creative inspiration that naturally comes from this sort of <strong>oppression</strong>. This inspiration gleaned from victims ultimately shows up in TV, movies, &amp; music, which means that there is a whole class of people benefitting from another class&#8217; suffering. It is an unspoken, unacknowledged form of <strong>slavery</strong> that can only result in emotional issues for the <strong>unwitting victims</strong>. These issues would then cause the victim to act out in a variety of ways, throughout their lives, since on some subconscious level, they probably know that they have been <strong>covertly enslaved</strong>.</p>
<p>This makes the <strong>TI</strong> the ultimate <strong>muse</strong> for an elitist system that sees people as mere &#8220;<strong>human resources</strong>&#8221; to be &#8220;utilized&#8221;. Trying to get any compensation or justice for what has been done to them, simply makes them look &#8220;crazy&#8221; or schizophrenic to those who don&#8217;t understand such a thing. However, part of me wonders if maybe everyone around the victim is well <img data-attachment-id="755" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/01/28/mcusingarchetypaltransference/justiceblind/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/justiceblind.jpg" data-orig-size="106,160" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="justiceblind" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/justiceblind.jpg?w=106" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/justiceblind.jpg?w=106" class="alignright size-full wp-image-755" alt="justiceblind" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/justiceblind.jpg?w=540"   />aware of the nightmare going on in front of their faces &amp; simply refuse to acknowledge it, lest the victim have a foothold into getting any justice for what has been done. There is a reason why &#8220;<strong>justice is blind</strong>&#8221; is a well-known phrase in this world, &amp; it has absolutely nothing to do with impartiality.</p>
<p>I am pretty sure that the idea of justice is now nothing more than a simulacrum of the original concept.</p>
<p>In my own situation, it seems that my whole life has been orchestrated, unbeknownst to me until more recently. I only just began to wake up to the situation in 2008, which is, coincidentally, the same year that I discovered I had implants in each ear. Symbolically &amp; psychologically, my life seems to have been completely manipulated to make me negative, sad, confused, depressed, &amp; apathetic. I have even seen how some of the more &#8220;metaphysical&#8221; technologies affected my adoptive mother&#8217;s life.</p>
<p>Some people would call what is happening to Targeted Individuals an affliction, but I would call it an <em>infliction</em> because it is inflicted on us by some other entity or entities.</p>
<p>When you present obvious evidence &amp; people don&#8217;t believe you, it can be extremely frustrating. Many of the same people who admit that the powers that be are using symbolism to manipulate human beings, will then deny the possibility that a person has been manipulated in this way. Many people who admit that there is all sorts of technology being used against people will then deny that implants exist, even though Dr. Delgado&#8217;s work in brain stimulation is well-known. This seems to be by design &amp; with the intent of driving the victim mad.</p>
<p>This will result in further discrediting the victim, who has most likely already had a smear campaign done against them. Those involved in these kinds of <strong>psyops</strong> (psychological operations), with the intent of destroying the victim&#8217;s life, credibility, sanity, and health, really deserve to be cursed to live the life they are consigning victims to.</p>
