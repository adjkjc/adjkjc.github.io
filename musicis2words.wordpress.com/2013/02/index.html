<p>Psychiatrist Carl Gustave Jung described the <strong>archetypes</strong> as models of people, behaviors, or personalities that exist in the collective unconscious. <strong>Transference</strong> is the projection of unconscious contents.</p>
<p>It is often said that <strong>a child&#8217;s mind is like a sponge</strong>.</p>
<p>It is my argument that these movies program females into the embodying the negative female stereotypes, such as: being catty, high maintenance princess-types who generally dislike or distrust their mothers. This is all <strong>subconscious</strong>, of course, &amp; most females will not admit to this being an issue.</p>
<p>As you can see, these stories have been around much longer than the Disney films in some form or another. This is how I feel many of these roles became archetypes in the first place. However, Disney in particular, seemed to have some interest in making the adult female role the antihero. Here are some of the Disney Princess movies that contain the archetypes of “princess”, “hero/prince”, and “evil queen”, and where they came from (skip past these, if you are already familiar with the background info):</p>
<p><strong>Rapunzel</strong>, a tale with similarities to a Persian tale from the 10th century AD called “Rudaba”, was published by the Brothers Grimm in 1812, which then became the basis for the Disney movie “Tangled”.<br />
<strong>The Little Mermaid</strong>, published in 1837 by Hans Christian Anderson, became the Disney animated film of the same name in 1989.<br />
<strong>Sleeping Beauty</strong>, taken from an original story called, “The Beauty sleeping in the wood”, by Charles Perrault, published in 1697, was made into the Disney animated film, 1959.<br />
<strong>Snow White</strong>, taken from an original story by the Brothers Grimm, in 1812, but completed in 1857, was made into the animated Disney film in 1937.<br />
<strong>Cinderella</strong>, taken from an original story by Charles Perrault, published in 1697, was later published by the Brothers Grimm in 1812, and made into a Disney animated film in 1950. However, there are earlier versions of this theme, in fables complete with slipper motif, going as far back as the 1st century BCE.</p>
<p><strong>The Set Up:</strong></p>
<p><em>Cinderella</em> was originally a story about unjust oppression with a reward at the end, and is possibly derived from an original Greek tale called <em>Rhodopis</em>, which contains no evil queen or wicked stepmother. The first version I could find with a wicked stepmother in it is a Chinese tale from 860 AD, called <em>Ye Xian</em> (Yeh Shen). The Disney movie Cinderella has the female antihero in its version, as does <em>Snow White</em>, <em>Sleeping Beauty</em>, <em>The Little Mermaid</em>, and <em>Tangled</em> (taken from <em>Rapunzel</em>). It is my opinion that these particular Disney movies actually serve to disempower women in general, although some of them do show assertive princesses. The repetition of the theme of the oppressed princess (daughter role), trapped by some rendition of the evil queen (mother role), but who ultimately gets rescued by a dashing prince (hero/lover role) does a gross disservice to women in general. By creating a set of unnatural archetypes based on roles from these stories, these roles subconsciously become projected onto people by the little girl (or adult woman who grew up with these stories).</p>
<p>Today’s little girl is more prone to the programming behind these movies, since they are inundated with the movies, DVDs, books, video <a href="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/princesscanopybed.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="872" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/02/25/archetypaltransferencedisneyprincessmovies/princesscanopybed/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/princesscanopybed.jpg" data-orig-size="160,143" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="PrincessCanopyBed" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/princesscanopybed.jpg?w=160" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/princesscanopybed.jpg?w=160" class="alignright size-full wp-image-872" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/princesscanopybed.jpg?w=540" alt="PrincessCanopyBed" srcset="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/princesscanopybed.jpg 160w, https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/princesscanopybed.jpg?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 160px) 100vw, 160px"   /></a>games, baby dolls, Barbie dolls, coloring books, figurines, room décor, outfits, etc., which all serve to reinforce the “princess” role in the child’s mind, before she has any defenses against such programming. By being exposed to these movies, over and over again (because of the advent of DVDs), and at such a young age (sometimes from birth), this programming is even harder to resist. It is often said that a child’s mind is like a sponge. Since the programming comes through on a subconscious level, the child’s open mind has no filtering mechanism to avoid being programmed. I would be remiss if I didn’t note that the extent to which a child is programmed by these stories may be directly related to the amount of trauma she has received in early childhood.</p>

In the animal kingdom, baby animals instinctively trust their mother, because the mother usually has an instinct to protect her young. Humans have these instincts as well, but they are subverted by programming inherent in these movies, among other things. By subconsciously identifying with the oppressed princess, the human daughter is subconsciously projecting the role of evil queen onto her mother (or other prominent female caregiver) who then becomes the antihero to the princess. In this way, the mother has become the enemy in her daughter’s eyes, albeit on a subconscious level. It is simple psychology.</p>
<p><strong>Anecdotal Evidence: </strong></p>
<p>I have witnessed this effect in my life, my adoptive mother’s life, and in my daughter’s life. Looking back, I know I projected the evil queen <a href="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/sleepingbeautysavedbyprince.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="876" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/02/25/archetypaltransferencedisneyprincessmovies/sleepingbeautysavedbyprince/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/sleepingbeautysavedbyprince.jpg" data-orig-size="160,119" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="SleepingBeautySavedByPrince" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/sleepingbeautysavedbyprince.jpg?w=160" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/sleepingbeautysavedbyprince.jpg?w=160" class="alignright size-full wp-image-876" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/sleepingbeautysavedbyprince.jpg?w=540" alt="SleepingBeautySavedByPrince" srcset="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/sleepingbeautysavedbyprince.jpg 160w, https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/sleepingbeautysavedbyprince.jpg?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 160px) 100vw, 160px"   /></a>role onto my mother, but did she subconsciously accept that role to a degree? In my mother’s case, she was indeed “rescued” from her family by her so-called “prince”, but it eventually didn’t work out, and they got a divorce, probably because of unrealistic expectations programmed into my mother’s psyche (a Greek word for &#8220;spirit&#8221;). I have to wonder if the woman who unknowingly identifies with the princess role as a child, subconsciously accepts the evil queen role when she enters motherhood, simply because it is the most prominent adult female archetype in movies that programmed her as a child. Could that be part of what happened to my mother (in addition to other forms of archetypal transference), and why I was verbally abused and neglected when I was growing up? My mother was also a narcissist, as are the evil queens/wicked stepmothers in the Disney princess movies, and I spent half of my childhood in a literal “house of mirrors”. Could that have come from the programming from these films? In my daughter’s case, I can see how she has internalized these archetypes, because she certainly acts like a little princess and often treats me as if I were the evil queen. I, however, refuse to accept that role. I love my child and have the natural instinct to protect my child. I projected the Huntsman role from Snow White onto my father, and as such, I put him up on a pedestal, even though he was rarely present in my childhood.</p>
<p>I now have to wonder if the programming from these princess movies is the root cause of why little girls seem to fight their mothers about things that are good for them, such as the way my daughter fights me when I tell her to brush her teeth, eat better foods, do her homework, take a bath, etc. While of course children want to play rather than do homework, would they be more <a href="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/lisahomerpipie.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="866" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/02/25/archetypaltransferencedisneyprincessmovies/lisahomerpipie/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/lisahomerpipie.jpg" data-orig-size="160,115" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="LisaHomerPiPie" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/lisahomerpipie.jpg?w=160" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/lisahomerpipie.jpg?w=160" class="alignright size-full wp-image-866" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/lisahomerpipie.jpg?w=540" alt="LisaHomerPiPie" srcset="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/lisahomerpipie.jpg 160w, https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/lisahomerpipie.jpg?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 160px) 100vw, 160px"   /></a>apt to follow parents’ instructions if they weren’t watching movies and TV shows that make the parents look either like an enemy or unintelligent? In the case of little girls, these princess movies are the biggest suspect, but in the case of little boys, you can simply take a look at television shows such as The Simpsons, which paint the father in a negative light, and make the children out to be smarter than their parents. If you are programmed by these shows to think that you are smarter than your parents, are you going to trust their advice?</p>
<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<p>I have been asked why someone would want to do this. There are a few reasons that I can think of:</p>
<p><a href="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/tangledsexsubliminal.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="856" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/02/25/archetypaltransferencedisneyprincessmovies/tangledsexsubliminal/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/tangledsexsubliminal.jpg" data-orig-size="134,160" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="TangledSexSubliminal" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/tangledsexsubliminal.jpg?w=134" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/tangledsexsubliminal.jpg?w=134" class="size-full wp-image-856 alignleft" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/tangledsexsubliminal.jpg?w=540" alt="TangledSexSubliminal"   /></a>First, you have to <em>follow the money</em>. It is a multimillion (if not billion) dollar industry, aimed at little girls. Princesses are royalty. What do we know about royalty? They have a whole lot of money and stuff. If you can get those children to identify with the princess role, then you can trigger this programming in media, which can then open them up to new programming in your movies, music, television, and advertisements, thereby making them into good little consumers who will buy, or get their parents to buy, anything you make them want. This is done simultaneously with the sexual subliminal messages found in many Disney films, if not all of them, which then brings the child’s subconscious mind to focus on sex (and on baser desires in general), programming which will be played out later, as the child reaches puberty. While the adage “<em>sex sells</em>” is often used in advertising, that is only one reason for <em>sexual subliminals</em>. By focusing children’s subconscious mind on sex, after already setting up the atmosphere of mistrust between parents and children, they will further stray from their parents’ advice, and it will be harder for them to focus on learning, spirituality, or finding a career.</p>
<p>The little girl who subconsciously identified with the “<em>oppressed princess</em>” role will project the “hero/prince” role onto any boyfriends she has as she gets older. However, these males were not programmed by these movies, and thus don’t fit that role very well. In fact, any boyfriend or husband to the female, who subconsciously identified with the princess role, will most likely grow to resent this woman and complain that she is too “<em>high maintenance</em>”. Well, duh, <em>she’s been programmed to be that way</em>! This sets a girl up for a big disappointment that occurs in the unconscious mind when she subconsciously recognizes that her mate can never fulfill the role of “hero/prince”. This will cause a form of cognitive dissonance that the grown woman will not be able to identify, and thus, she will not be able to address or resolve the issue at heart, if she seeks psychological help. The end result of all of this unrealistic programming is depression, among other mental health issues.</p>
<p>If you can get children to mistrust their parents (especially on a subconscious level they cannot recognize), this makes it easier to program them using the media. By the way, this subconscious programming of little children to mistrust their parents is reinforced when they realize the parents have been lying to them about Santa, the Easter Bunny, and the Tooth fairy. Again, this happens on a subconscious level, which makes it all the more insidious and difficult to correct, once the damage has been done. It is easier to program a person who lacks foundational values. This is accomplished as a result of the child being somewhat cut-off from a parent’s protective instinct due to the subconscious lack of trust caused by these movies, as well as certain TV shows. How does one deprogram a child that has had the princess programming reinforced throughout their childhood via the umpteen million Disney princess products on the market (mentioned above)? If a parent tries to raise awareness about the issue to the child, the child is not going to admit that they identify with the Disney princess, or Bart or Lisa Simpson for that matter, because it is not in the conscious mind.<strong> The fact that it is done on a subconscious level is what makes it work so well. People quickly deny it is real precisely because they are unconscious of it.</strong></p>
<p>With these programs in the subconscious mind, triggers can be used to bring this<em> programming</em> to bear in multiple ways. Take the shopping addict for example. Could that be a subconscious reaction to princess programming? How about addiction in general? What about hoarding? Overeating or eating disorders? I already mentioned depression. These mental health issues support an industry already in place: Psychiatric medicine, i.e. pharmaceutical drugs. I feel that many disorders that people suffer are caused by programming, to keep a whole industry running, thereby making a small portion of the population very wealthy from other people’s suffering, without actually curing anything. The only real way to cure some of these issues, in my opinion, is with deprogramming. Most psychiatrists and psychologists out there barely even admit programming exists, much less want to cure it. One begins to see a vicious cycle going on with all of this.</p>
<p>Is it any wonder that Hitler is said to have had a Mickey Mouse figurine on his desk?<a href="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/priestwitherection.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="863" data-permalink="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/02/25/archetypaltransferencedisneyprincessmovies/priestwitherection/" data-orig-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/priestwitherection.jpg" data-orig-size="160,103" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-image-title="PriestWithErection" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/priestwitherection.jpg?w=160" data-large-file="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/priestwitherection.jpg?w=160" class="alignright size-full wp-image-863" style="width:184px;height:136px;" src="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/priestwitherection.jpg?w=540" alt="PriestWithErection" srcset="https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/priestwitherection.jpg 160w, https://musicis2words.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/priestwitherection.jpg?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 160px) 100vw, 160px"   /></a></p>
<p>So, if you are a mother with a young daughter, and if you decide to expose your little girl to these movies, I ask you to offer parental guidance with these princess movies. I feel that any movie showing a priest getting an erection during a wedding should not be rated G. I don’t buy the story that it is actually the priest’s knees because the erection scene is one lump, not two. Once that initial subconscious separation between mother and daughter is made, then the little girl is directed to follow her <strong>over-sexualized Disney role models</strong>, such as Brittny Spears &amp; Miley Cyrus.</p>
<p>Of course, the extent to which all mind control works on the psyche is dependent on variables in the individual subject&#8217;s life, like how much early childhood trauma they might have had, or whether their parents made any effort to instill values into them, for two examples.</p>

<p>-Mother uses method of allowing baby to scream until she passes out in the crib. I remember climbing out of the crib, at one point, &amp; falling on the tile floor.</p>
<p>-Mother named me with initials that spell &#8220;cat&#8221;, even though she didn&#8217;t even like cats, which she told me.</p>
<p>&#8211;<strong>Drowning</strong> at 3y/o, which is common to <strong>ritual abuse</strong> victims.</p>
<p>-Being made to write right-handed, against my natural inclination to be left-handed, throwing the brain off its natural balance, making a person even more suggestible.</p>
<p>-Lack of parental role models (father always away on business trips &amp; mother simply away), which primes a person to be suggestible, by making a female victim seek out the missing <strong>father figure</strong> in her boyfriends. Once found, the female victim will then believe whatever this &#8220;father figure&#8221; boyfriend tells them, because she has no <strong>foundational values</strong> from her parents.</p>
<p>&#8211;<strong>Neglect</strong> and <strong>verbal abuse</strong> from parents is negative reinforcement which has negative effects on any child. Father made fun of me for being slightly overweight, &amp; made up songs about being fat. Mother consistently compared me to relatives &amp; friends, &amp; would often tell me &#8220;you are stupid, stupid, stupid, and you&#8217;re never going to amount to anything&#8221;, which became a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>
<p>-Television was main babysitter.</p>
<p>-Allowed to play in the woods alone at 6 &amp; 7 years old.</p>
<p>-Being allowed to watch movies like &#8220;Rosemary&#8217;s Baby&#8221;, &#8220;The Omen&#8221;, &amp; &#8220;The Exorcist&#8221;, before the age of 7.</p>
<p>-Physical abuse from brother. Ex: He wrapped me up in a blanket &amp; pushed down the stairs. I must&#8217;ve been about 4 or 5, since my head didn&#8217;t hit the bannister &amp; my feet didn&#8217;t touch the wall. Got to the bottom to find my parents standing over me, pointing their fingers &amp; laughing at me.</p>
<p>-2nd drowning at 12y/o.</p>
<p>-Mother had me selling hotdogs in a bikini at construction sites at 14y/o.</p>
<p>-Raped at 16y/o by a 21y/o male friend of my mother&#8217;s.</p>
<p>-Railroaded into making a false confession at 17y/o, when someone supposedly stole my mother&#8217;s wallet (years later, I would find out she was a heavy gambler). The cops/detectives in that case weren&#8217;t really interested in finding the truth, they just wanted to close the case. They knew at 17y/o, I didn&#8217;t know my rights, &amp; told me that if I didn&#8217;t confess, they would throw me in jail.</p>
<p>Trauma, mixed with neglect, television, &amp; implants (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74Os-iN9J0Q" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74Os-iN9J0Q</a>) combine to make mind control a breeze for the handler(s). Implants, possibly used during sleep, allows for post hypnotic suggestion, making the victim a virtual puppet by removing freewill.</p>
<p>The trauma I suffered, along with neglect and verbal abuse, forced me into a situation of reacting to negative programming, put in place at a young age.</p>
<p>I continue to write about this in the hopes that someone will see why what is happening to me is absolutely wrong &amp; not my fault. When a person&#8217;s <strong>freewill</strong> is taken away from them with programming on so many levels, that person cannot be blamed for reacting to it.</p>
<p>It seems very sad that things got so bad for me at a time when I was actively trying to become a more positive person in my life. I wish that God, the true, just, &amp; merciful <strong>God</strong>, would see the truth of what happened in my life, &amp; how some outside party took my freewill away from me, forcing me to be negative.</p>
<p>The following links address negative reinforcement as a <strong>self-fulfilling prophecy</strong>:<br />

<p>The link above completely explains how a child that originally had a high IQ in gradeschool ended up lucky to graduate highschool with a C average. This is why I make an effort to tell my child she is smart, and have done so since she was a baby. While I am grateful that I have learned, apophatically, about how to be a decent parent, I am saddened by the fact that the life I was supposed to have was stolen from me through these negative types of <strong>programming</strong>.</p>
<p>Now, I want to list some of the traumas that happened to me as an adult:</p>
<p>-Had a surgery for cervical dysplasia in 2004, wherein I was under a general anesthetic and something terrible happened to me, of which I had a flashback in 2010. This caused a condition known as vulvodynia, which involves a delayed onset of pain resulting from trauma to the area. This pain started in 2008.</p>
<p>-I discovered implants in each ear in 2008, not long before that pain began, and also in the same year, I began to hear voices.</p>
<p>-My boyfriend &amp; father of our daughter, tried to have me locked up twice, which cost me my job.</p>
<p>-He left me in the house he forced us to move into, taking our daughter. I had begged him not to buy this house because the house payment would be about 3 times the rent we were paying (it was the height of the housing bubble in 2005). I wanted to just move out of the neighborhood, into an apartment, until the housing market bubble burst.</p>
<p>-Two weeks after he left, my pain started. It was and is traumatic, especially given its location. It feels like my crotch is being electrocuted.</p>
<p>-He said he’d leave one of our two cars with me, but took both anyway. Being in this kind of constant pain made it difficult for me to walk, much less go find a new job.</p>
<p>-He came busting into the house saying he had a dream I was selling the tools he left there. Given what he did to me, and my condition, I really didn’t have a choice. He tried to smash some of my things, and I tried to stop him. At this point, he grabbed me and threw me on the floor. This happened a total of 3 times, and on the third time, I hit the chair on my way down to the floor. Then he grabbed my cell phone, ran out the front door, stood up against the door so I couldn’t get out, and he called the cops on me for domestic violence. The man is literally twice my size. He does have a record of domestic violence with an ex-girlfriend.</p>
<p>-Not long after that event, the power went off, then the water, and finally garbage service. I was stuck, in horrible, traumatic pain, in the worst heat, which was an additional psychological trauma. I washed my hair in rain water that I collected in storage bins, and I cooked food on a gutted toaster oven, inside which I put fire. When winter came, I would have as many candles lit as I could, to keep the room a bit less cold. I lived like this for over 2 years.</p>
<p>-At one point, a police helicopter flew around the house, at around 2:30 AM, for about a half an hour, with its spotlight shining in the windows. I found the middle point of the house and crouched down there. What is odd about this is the fact that no cop car showed up during this time, which tells me that it was done just to traumatize me.</p>
<p>-He went around the neighborhood, talking to neighbors about me behind my back.</p>
<p>-He put a lock on the mailbox, and used a saw to cut a slit in it. This allowed postal workers to deliver mail, but I was unable to retrieve it.</p>

<p>(By the way, I misspell perpetrator as “perpetraitor” on purpose, because that is what they are: traitors who are perps)</p>
<p>If you remember a game show called &#8220;The 100,000 Dollar Pyramid&#8221;, the title of this document might give you a tiny laugh.</p>
<p>The target is sick. The target is a loser. The target is a bully (what a joke). The target was born out of wedlock, which makes them a bastard, and God doesn’t care about them anyway. The target is gay. The target is anti-gay. The target is a drug user. The target is a bum. The target is a racist. The target is a child-molester. The target is stupid. The target is a whore. The target is a slut. The target is ugly. The target is evil. The target is the devil, or a demon. The target is an MK Ultra victim, and they don’t want any witnesses. The target is “just a bitch”. The target is a pervert. The target is crazy. The target did bad things to people in the past. The target has a record. The target is a bad parent. The target eats cheesecake (that one’s just me trying to have a sense of humor about all of this). The target knows too much. The target is too old. The target is too young. The target is an embarrassment (to their cult, perhaps).</p>
<p>The accusations levied against the target may or may not be true. Many times, the target was born into this program, set up on purpose to make them look bad, after much trauma, sort of like torturing an animal and blaming the animal for reacting to being psychologically tortured and for fighting back. Often, the target is a victim of mind control, to a greater degree than the general population that is, and is being blamed for things they did as a result of a most wicked form of mind control, using trauma, among other things, and sometimes even implants.</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">WHY NONE OF THESE ARE GOOD ENOUGH EXCUSES FOR WHAT PERPETRAITORS ARE DOING TO TARGETED INDIVIDUALS:</span></b></p>
<p>The perpetraitors possibly do not know the whole truth about the individual they are destroying. They have probably been told half-truths and/or outright lies about the individual whom they are targeting. The target may have been handed off from one group of perps to the next, with each successive group being told only part of the story. Since, in many cases, the target has been a target since birth, through programs such as the Monarch Program or MK Ultra, they have been mind controlled throughout their lives, unbeknownst to them, and possibly unbeknownst to the perp as well.</p>
<p>If you are a nonconsensual human experimentee, like me, then you probably know what I am talking about. Many of you who have read my articles or watched my YouTube videos already know that I found implants in my ears in 2008. That means I have possibly been an experimentee since I was born and kept at a hospital, for the first 6 weeks of my life, in the custody of an adoption agency. This also means that anything I did while under the influence of these implants, which may indeed be cochlear implants, is directly attributable to those who are using these implants to influence my life, since I never consented to the procedure.</p>
<p>Mind Control does not equal consent.</p>
<p>However, according to these perpetraitors, I have already been judged.</p>
<p>Some of you who have been targeted are aware of something called the “Truman Show Effect”. We call it that because, as targets, we see bits and pieces of our life stories displayed in movies, music, and tell-a-vision. This leads me to the conclusion that we, the victims in this horrible and inhumane crime, are like slaves, whereby all of our intellectual property is stolen from us, and others get to profit from our suffering. It is the most disgusting crime that could ever be thought up, since the victim (so far) has no real proof, the perpetraitors have plausible deniability, and the nation denies that slavery even exists.</p>
<p>The scary part is that when I looked back over my life, I have noticed this effect going on to some degree throughout it. One example of this is the fact that when I was very young, maybe about 6 or 7, I had this thought: “What if the world around us, that we see, isn’t actually real? What if it is like some kind of movie, covering our field of vision?” I had no idea about virtual reality back then, and this was how I put the concept into words. Years later, I would see Disney come out with the 365 degree movies at Epcot. Eventually, I would see the concept in movies such as “The Matrix” and “Dark City”. It seems to me that someone<b> </b>or some group has VIP access to the collective consciousness and is able to steal from people who are held down for just such a purpose. Some of you may see how this is done on both physical and metaphysical levels.</p>
<p>Now, it seems, that is what I am seeing in this world. It is a world where we are made to believe that everyone has the same chance in life, but it is hardly the case. It has become a world where our  intellectual property is stolen, and then they sell it back to us in the form of music, movies, and tell-a-vision. What if there is a whole section of the population going through this on some level. One example would be how there are inventors who have become targeted individuals. Another would be how Renee Caisse, who invented ESSIAC Tea, had sold her idea to a pharmaceutical company that shelved it, after promising that they would research and develop her formula. Another would be how Ayn Rand died not too long after she, and the producer of the film “Atlas Shrugged”, had an argument about her wanting artistic rights to make a certain scene the way she wanted. During the argument, the producer said something like, “That’s all right, I’ll just wait until you die and make the movie how I want to”.</p>
<p>This happens all the time, although most people either don’t notice it or don’t want to admit to it. I bet that all these people writing in blogs are being stolen from, in some form or another. “We live in a wheel where everyone steals” is what I heard the band “Bush” say some time ago. I would hope that this form of slavery doesn’t last forever, because I fear it causes major problems in people’s lives, probably on a subliminal level, and they are possibly disturbed by the sense that they are being ripped off, but cannot put their finger on what is really going on. As a result of this subconscious feeling that you are being robbed, you may have emotional issues that end up affecting the way you interact with others. Eventually, this will get used against you, even though it cannot truly be blamed on you.</p>
<p>Would those who perpetrate this horrible crime on victims continue to do so if they were conscious of what we victims have been going through as a result of this legal type of slavery? Any negative karma generated by the slave happens as a direct result of living in reaction to an unknown cause of suffering, and that karma must be reaped by those who benefit from the slave’s misery of being a slave in a society that refuses to admit that slavery even exists. When someone who is not of a privileged class tries to do something that is not a typical vocation for a lower to middle class individual, they often end up becoming overtly targeted, whereas before that point, they probably didn’t notice the targeting was happening.</p>
<p>It seems to be a form of psychic vampirism, whereby the target is a victim, and the perpetraitors are the vampires. The victims are bled dry of their creative inspiration, their resources, and any of their forms of support. The targets are made to look crazy with the evil technologies being used against them, whether through the use of implants (mine are located in my ears), some form of heterodyning, occult magic, negative thought forms, directed energy weapons. I have researched enough to know they have a huge arsenal at their disposal.</p>
<p>I am led to wonder if all targets are set up since birth. Are we told a big lie about how this is the “land of the free and the home of the brave”, and how this country is about, “liberty and justice for all”, while everyone else knows the truth, but aren’t telling? Does everyone know that we are targets who were used since birth by the vampires around us? I have been told that I am a ritual sacrifice, which is why my life looks like someone upstairs was playing a big joke on me.</p>
<p>Numerology does seem to play some kind of a role in the lives of various targeted individuals I have met. Could that be how many of us are picked out at birth, possibly stolen through adoption and sold into these sick programs of covert slavery? I guarantee that if you are a REAL target, you have either the 12 or 11 in your numerology, if not both, and if not, then I bet you might have the letters AN in your name somewhere, especially if combined with a C or CH.</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Here’s what they Ought to say, to be Closer to the Truth of the Situation:</span></b></p>
<p>We traumatize you from birth, and then we blame you for not being perfect. We make you nuts, and then blame you for being that way. We steal from you on so many levels, and then blame you for feeling the need to hold onto things (which we call selfishness). We torture your mind, and then blame you for reacting to it. We steal your intellectual property, and then blame you for feeling disturbed. We ruin your life, and then blame you for not being able to make your way in the world. We turn your whole life upside-down, and then blame you for being negative. We cause you physical and mental problems, but then deny you disability. We program you from birth, and then blame you for not being what you were supposed to be, had we not messed with your head in the first place. (And in my case) We make you spend half your childhood in a house of mirrors, and then blame you for being a narcissist. (Also in my case) We place every importance on your body as a woman, and then blame you for being too focused on your body.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, this is the world of the double bind, designed to cause cognitive dissonance in those who are the designated sacrifices. Problem, Reaction Solution: They cause the problem in you, and then demonize you for your reaction, and the apparent solution is torturing you to death.</p>
<p>I even heard one of them tell me that we are just food to them. Let them reap that karma, all of it, including any karma caused as a result of what the target has most likely been put through since birth.</p>

<p>This video shows my implants better than photos do. Searching for an honorable doctor or attorney to help me.</p>
<p>Here is a link showing when this technology first came out:</p>

<p>From this document:</p>
<p>&#8220;The first CI was implanted by William House and John Doyle of Los Angeles, California, in 1961. In 1964, Blair Simmons and Robert White of Stanford University, Stanford, California, placed a 6-channel electrode through the promontory and vestibule directly into the modiolus.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was born &amp; adopted in the late 1960s through a catholic agency. In the last few years, I have seen a number of adoption scandals come out where babies were stolen from the natural parents, who were then told the newborn died, and that the doctor would &#8220;handle it&#8221;, so the mother wouldn&#8217;t have to deal with the emotional trauma of seeing her &#8220;dead child&#8221;&#8230;. the child was then sold&#8230; sometimes to parents, but sometimes, into experimental mind control programs. I am one such child.</p>
<p>I need real legal &amp; medical help. I have been searching for years now, &amp; have not been able to locate anyone close enough to me to help me find out the truth. I would like to have one of these two, RFID-sized implants removed, so I could hopefully find a serial number &amp; track down the manufacturer.</p>

		<h3 class="result"><a href="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2013/02/05/judged-in-absentia/" rel="bookmark">Judged In Absentia</a></h3>					<p>After being reminded of a website by fellow WordPress author, lissakr11humanelife, I decided to take another look at it, since it talks about the technical possibilities of this nightmare called “<b>stalking by proxy</b>” or “the program”.</p>
<p>The author of this website (<a href="http://www.dataasylum.com">www.dataasylum.com</a>) talks about how the so-called “targeted individual” has been judged by some unseen entity (or entities), which is why the target is in this sick “<b>program</b>”. What he doesn’t mention is the fact that through other forms of <b>mind control</b>, such as movies, music, television, and the manipulation of language, the targeted individual has been set up in the first place, since birth, in most cases. If you are a <b>targeted individual</b>, you might consider the possibility that you might have always been a <b>nonconsensual human experimentee</b>.</p>
<p>Being railroaded into making a false confession when I was 17 years old, by police officers who were not interested in finding out the truth but were only interested in closing the case quickly, should have clued me in on what kind of a system I am living in, a long time ago. I guess I just didn’t want to believe that, after what I was taught about this country regarding the whole “liberty and justice for all” concept. Sadly, the ideal of true<b> justice</b> has indeed become a <b>simulacrum</b> that I have only been able to find in a clothing line.</p>
<p>I must reiterate the fact that many people, including myself, after looking back over their lives, see how they seem to have been set up in the first place, and that their lives seem to have been <b>orchestrated</b>. In retrospect, I now see how my actions have been merely reactions to a negative set of circumstances, involving <b>trauma</b>, neglect, verbal abuse, physical abuse, within my family as well as from outsiders, such as teachers, doctors, and police officers. In my case, I was living with very little freewill, as I suspect are many people who have grown up under similar circumstances.</p>
<p>On the website referred to above, the author states that the targeted individual is “<b>judged in absentia</b>”, meaning that the target has no way of defending against this nasty procedure, since every negative action in their life is most likely <strong>taken out of context</strong>, by unseen accusers. Given the fact that mind control has been around much longer than anyone seems to realize (for millennia since Pharonic Egyptians were doing it for cryin’ out loud!), it becomes difficult to avoid the possibility that people who are judged as guilty by this weird program, were most likely pushed via mind control into being the person they find themselves currently judged for being.</p>
<p>Most of you who read my work, know that I am a victim of<b> implantation without consent</b>.  You may also know about the various forms of mind control programming without the use of implants, as mentioned above. So I find myself asking this question over and over again: How can anyone blame a puppet for what some unseen puppet master is responsible for?</p>
<p>Okay, so let me state, for the record, that I am not committing any crimes, although I <i>used to be</i> a drug addict. Well, it’s no wonder when you consider the circumstances I grew up in! I was separated from my natural mother at birth and kept in a hospital with no real bonding between me and my adoptive parents for the first 6 weeks of life, had a near drowning at the age of 3, was verbally abused throughout my childhood (unless I was left alone with the TV as my main babysitter), allowed to see movies such as The Omen and The Exorcist at age 7, allowed to play in the woods alone at 6 &amp; 7 years old, had another near drowning at the age of 12, spent half my childhood in a house of mirrors (even the wallpaper, coffee table, switch plates &amp; outlet covers were all mirrored!), made to sell hotdogs at construction sites in a bikini when I was 14, raped at 16 by a 21 year old man, forced into a false confession at 17, and there’s more, but I don’t want to go into it right now. Suffice it to say I had no <b>foundational values</b> instilled in me by my family, and I pretty much espoused my boyfriends’ beliefs, since I had no <b>father figure</b>. It is a miracle that I ended up a nonviolent person. Heck, it is a miracle that I didn’t wind up being a serial killer! Beyond that, it is a miracle that I am no longer a drug addict, considering the fact that I have been in horrible pain for the past 4.5 years.</p>
<p>Yet, I find myself being judged by some unknown force, who is either not considering the above mentioned facts (and much more) of my life, or who already knows it might have been orchestrated in the first place. Either way, I feel like a<b> scapegoat</b> (ironic, considering the placement of my implants).</p>
<p>I know that my whole life has been like a reaction to my circumstances of abuse, neglect, mind control, etc. That means I never truly had freewill. So what does that bode for all of us? Well, one thing is for sure &#8211; it means those of us who have been under mind control, to believe some sort of false reality, cannot be held liable for our reactions to that false reality, in my opinion, anyway.</p>
<p>Peace All.</p>

<p><b>Mind Control Using Symbolism in Words and Numbers:</b></p>
<p>There are many methods of <em>mind control</em> that have been uncovered. As most of you know, there is <em>symbolism</em> and <em>subliminals</em> used in movies, music, and television; there are also high tech forms of mind control, using <em>implants</em> (nano or otherwise) and other technologies; there is mind control involving the use of <em>trauma</em> to mess with the human being’s psychology; and then there is the manipulation of language. While the technology I have researched seems to be completely plausible, I am taking a look at language now, because it has been around much longer than the technology currently in use has been, and has a wider scope of impact.</p>
<p><em>Language</em>, including words, names, phrases, and slang, seems to contain a disproportionate amount of <em>negative symbolism</em> (considering many root words), and it can even sometimes be confusing, albeit on a level that is hard to discern. This creates a subconscious and subtle base layer of confusion which then sets the stage for general mind control using other technologies, like movies, music, and television, for example.</p>
<p>Because symbolism bypasses the conscious mind and goes straight into the <em>subconscious</em>, it is a type of programming, especially when used in language, which is learned during the most impressionable years of a child’s life.</p>
<p><b>Here are some words &amp; numbers that should be looked at symbolically, given the way symbolism affects the human psyche: </b></p>
<p>As I&#8217;ve noted in other documents, the word &#8220;<em>psyche</em>&#8221; is a Greek word denoting the <em>spirit</em>, which speaks volumes in itself. So <em>psychology</em>, then, is really the study of the spirit.</p>
<p>Century and Millennia: “cent” means 100, thus a century = 100 years. “Mill” refers to 1000,000, but a millennia = 1000 years (not a million years). Like the way certain months are not in line with their numbering, I contend that things like this can throw the mind out of balance, in a subconscious way, thus making it easier for a person to be programmed by the above mentioned technologies.</p>
<p>Therapist = “the rapist”, which I had picked up many years ago, from a movie called, “Girl Interrupted” (Angelina Jolie’s character says it).</p>
<p>Ever noticed how many names have the word “war” in them? Warburg, Warner, Warren (as in the Warren Commission), are a few. By the way, “war” is not exactly fair, is it, yet there is a term out there known as “warfare”… does this word, because of the way it sounds symbolically, make it so that more people accept war happening in our world?</p>
<p>Which brings us to the expression, “all’s fair in love and war”, but it isn’t true. However, does the prevalence of that expression in our world, subconsciously make people accept things that occur in love and war?</p>
<p>Consider how many words and names have root words like “ill”, “ow”, “mar”, “mal” or “ick” in them. Examples are Bill, Bow, Mark, Malcolm, and Trick, respectively.</p>
<p>Left vs. Right:</p>
<p>Okay, so the word “right” usually refers to the following in the English language: a direction, right handed, correct, the conservative party… phonetically, there is also rite, as in a ritual, or also right as in &#8220;human rights&#8221;, while….</p>
<p>The word “left” traditionally refers to: a direction, left as in the “liberal party”, and left as in “gone”. By the way, left-handedness is often called “south paw”… is there any symbolism there? If right means “correct”, does left symbolically mean “wrong”? Question: What happens if a person is naturally left-handed, but made to be right-handed? I ask this with the knowledge that a stroke in the left hemisphere of the brain has effects on the right side of the body &amp; vice versa. Is this how the whole left-handers are right brained, and right-handers are left brained concept was developed? If someone who is left-handed is made to be right-handed, would it take them out of their right mind, symbolically, metaphorically, metaphysically, spiritually? Some illustrious scientist ought to do a study on the effects of forcing a left-hander to be right-handed, instead of experimenting with brain implants on children from compromised groups (like adoptees). Back in the day, left handedness was considered a sign of being a witch, and meant that a person was “evil”…</p>
<p>This brings me to the word “evil”… Is Eve ill?</p>
<p>While we’re on the biblical: what about “Cain &amp; Abel”? Abel=able (as in “able-bodied”) Cain=cane (as in a tool to help a person walk)… could Cain have been disabled??? Dis Abel (dis-as in disrespect). Is this some kind of a joke? Did Cain really kill Abel? Judging by their names, it seems to me that Cain was disabled. I hope you don’t think I am blaspheming here, because I am simply searching for the truth.</p>
<p>Graven = as past participle of &#8220;grave&#8221;, meaning &#8220;fraught with danger or harm&#8221;.</p>
<p>So are graven images merely images that are fraught with danger or harm? When I look at certain trump cards of the tarot, like the Tower, the Hanged Man, and Death, for example, this seems to be the case. It also seems to be the case in the use and near worship of the crucifix that so many people are fond of. Please see my document: <a href="https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2012/09/11/symbolism-mind-control-and-metaphysical-sabotage-in-relation-to-archetypal-transference-and-the-second-commandment-of-the-decalogue" rel="nofollow">https://musicis2words.wordpress.com/2012/09/11/symbolism-mind-control-and-metaphysical-sabotage-in-relation-to-archetypal-transference-and-the-second-commandment-of-the-decalogue</a></p>
<p>Justice = &#8220;just us&#8221; (from Jordan Maxwell), but how about “just-ice”?</p>
<p>Why is justice blind anyway? Some people say that this phrase relates the idea that justice is impartial. Well, why not just say “justice is impartial”? I need her to be sighted and to see the whole truth, because I feel like I am being judged for actions or behaviors taken out of context. Why can I not get justice for the horrible things that have been done to me ever since I was taken from my mother at birth, if the United States is supposed to be about “liberty and justice for all”? Alas, the ideal of “justice” has simply become yet another simulacrum in our modern world, only to be found in a clothing line these days.</p>
<p>Government = govern= to control and ment=mind =&#8221;control of the mind&#8221; (from Michael Tsarion)</p>
<p>Horus = “Whore us”</p>
<p>Hermes = “her-me’s”</p>
<p>Masons = “Ma-sons”</p>
<p>Masturbate = “master”, as in ruler, and “bait” as in what you use to go fishing.</p>
<p>Peace = piece=a gun or (piece of?) = peas</p>
<p>Nazi = “Not see” or “Not C”</p>
<p>Frequency = Freak when c or Free Quincy?</p>
<p>Alphabet = alpha (male) bet (wager)</p>
<p>DISC= “dis” “c” (as in disrespect)</p>
<p>Curfew = &#8220;cure few&#8221;</p>
<p>Culture= &#8220;cult&#8221;ure = as in a cult, or as in a petri dish</p>
<p>Television= &#8220;tell-a-vision&#8221;</p>
<p>Metaphor = &#8220;meta&#8221; (above, beyond, before, or about); phor= &#8220;four&#8221; (4th trump of tarot is the Emperor card), so metaphor seems to favor the rulers of this world.</p>
<p>History = “his story” and Hebrews = “He brews” are easy examples of the misogynistic nature of our world.</p>
<p>Women are said to age less gracefully than men. Could the word &#8220;heritage&#8221; have something to do with that?</p>
<p>9= Nine = &#8220;nein&#8221; = &#8220;no&#8221;(from Michael Tsarion)</p>
<p>11= Eleven = El (a name of God, as in “elohim”) even (equal) eleven = 11th trump of various tarot decks (research them: in most, it means &#8220;justice&#8221;, or “strength”, while in one deck, it means &#8220;lust&#8221;). 11th sphere of cabala is supposed to represent &#8220;knowledge&#8221;, but it is often missing from the cabbalistic tree. So does 9/11 equate to &#8220;no justice&#8221;, “no strength, or &#8220;no knowledge&#8221;???? Did all those people die as blood sacrifices to empower some desire for no justice, strength, or knowledge??</p>
<p>12= tw elve as in elves.</p>
<p>Most people recognize that Santa is an anagram of satan</p>
<p>Regarding numbers, would it not throw a young psyche off balance to learn the word “oct” (as in “octagon”) means “eight”, yet October is the 10<sup>th</sup> month? How about “sept” meaning seven, even though September is the 9<sup>th</sup> month? And don’t forget November and December. “Nov” means 9, and “Dec” refers to 10 (see: “Decade”). I have heard one person say that they had added on a few months in the names of Augustus and Julius Ceasar, but that is no reason to name the last four months out of sync with the way they are numbered. Also, a natural calendar would have 13 months of 28 days each, since the word “month” refers to “moon”.</p>
<p>Music= <em>mu</em> (12th letter of greek alphabet) &amp; sic (&#8220;as intentionally so written&#8221;), and also “muse sick”. So this word, <em>sic</em>, could be symbolically felt as “12, as in intentionally so written”. As someone with a 12/12 birthdate, I cannot help but feel I have been programmed.</p>
<p>I have heard some people say &#8220;Obama nation&#8221;&#8230;  it sounds like they’re saying &#8220;abomination” or “Oh bomb a nation”.</p>
<p>So when I hear people speak about <em>freewill</em>, I beg to differ if a portion of us are affected by these negative and/or confusing things in our language. It seems to me that more often than not, people are reacting to situations or circumstances set up long before we were ever born. This kind of destroys the concept of <em>freewill</em> for me. Especially when I consider how my adoptive mother named me with the initials, “C.A.T.”, and didn&#8217;t even like cats. Could that have had something to do with the way I was mistreated and neglected when I was growing up? Then, as an up and coming art student, I met a fellow student with the last name of &#8220;Skinner&#8221;, who was able to somehow steal many of ideas and ended up ruining my career and my life. The phrase, &#8220;How many ways can you skin the cat&#8221; comes to mind. Again, I ask, is this some kind of a joke?</p>
<p>Also, I have heard it said, many times, that animals are more sensitive than people. Could this have something to do with why I had such a hard time dealing with being bullied and neglected by my adoptive parents? They would often tell me I was too sensitive. Could my being “extra sensitive” have something to do with the <em>self-fulfilling prophecy</em> of my mother calling me stupid, and saying that I would never amount to anything?</p>
<p>For those of you who think I am being blasphemous, I ask you to remember that the Bible states that God loves the truth, which is all I am trying to find and talk about. I am sadly reminded of the song, “Blasphemous Rumors”, by Depeche Mode, where they sing, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to start any blasphemous rumors, but I think that God has a sick sense of humor, and when I die, I expect to find him laughing&#8221;. Doesn’t the bible also say that the Truth shall set you free”? I sure hope so. I sure hope that God can see how all my life seems to have been lived as a reaction to a negative programming (including much more than just the language), over which I had no control.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s more to come&#8230;&#8230;.</p>

<p>We are living in a real-world rendition of the movie “Lord of the Flies”, where people are raised to believe they actually live in a democratic society that cares about justice. Well, I can assure you it is anything but. It is so close to the situation in the George Orwell movie called “1984” that it is frightening to those of you who actually care about the idea of a civilized democracy, in which people are “free”.</p>
<p>If you grew up believing that the United States of America was a “free country”, then you’ve been duped. When you try to exercise that freedom, to speak out about an injustice, or to grow a garden in your backyard, you are killed via “no-touch torture”. It seems like some victims of this &#8220;targeting&#8221; were even born into it, never having the chance to rise above this heap of mediocrity encouraged by the system through it&#8217;s narcotic of TV, music, and movies.</p>
<p>The reason we Americans were told that it was a free country was so that those of us who were made to believe it would eventually speak up about some of the atrocities we were witnessing. Then they could justify killing those of us who actually believe in human rights. It reminds me of the book, &#8220;Lord of the Flies&#8221;, where it is &#8220;kill or be killed&#8221;, and those of us who were brought up to believe it was anything other than some perverted form of &#8220;survival of the fittest&#8221; were lied to by those in power. Perpetraitors (mispelled on purpose to make a point), are willing to kill off those who stand up for ideals that we thought the U.S. embodied. Sad thing is, that it isn&#8217;t even truly a case of &#8220;survival of the fittest&#8221;, because if you are mind controlled at birth, you may actually be more fit than those in charge, they just don&#8217;t ever give you the chance to find out, which is why there is ritual abuse that causes serious trauma to a young mind, and mind control via movies, music, and tell-a-vision.</p>
<p>If people don’t stand up now against the gross violation of human rights that exists in the “soft-kill/slow-kill” arena, then we are all doomed as a nation. The only hope I retain then, is that those in power who have orchestrated this monstrosity, will eventually feed off each other, once they kill off the rest of us.</p>
<p>Even the ideal of justice doesn’t exist anymore, and frankly, I’m afraid it never did, at least not in the form a person who cares about true justice would think. Justice now exists only as a simulacrum, which no longer seems to hold any of the original meaning of the word. It started with the phrase “justice is blind”, and eventually that became so. Justice was no longer able to see the whole of a situation before rendering a decision. Now, we the people can only see justice appearing as a clothing line, which identifies it now as a simulacrum.</p>
<p>Welcome to the desert of the real.</p>
<p>For an example of why I feel that justice no longer truly exists, see the following link:</p>

<p>(I wish I had read those sooner- I might’ve understood how to behave in this upside-down world)</p>
