    shipping information, and will process Payment Transactions on behalf of

    a participating Carrier, as applicable. GPC may delay payment processing of

    network for processing one or more times in the event that a prior Payment
    Transaction is declined or returned by the payment network.</p>
  <p>3.2 Carrier Billing</p>
  <p>Certain Sellers that accept Google Payments may permit you to have your
    purchase billed to your Carrier Billing Account. These additional terms
    apply when you use Carrier Billing through Google Payments.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>To register your Carrier Billing Account as a payment option,
      Google Payments requires your mobile telephone number, and the name and
      billing address, including zip code, of the Carrier Billing Account
      associated with that number. You consent to your Carrier providing this
      information to Google Payments , and you will review the information
      during sign-up for Carrier Billing, and correct any inaccuracies. This
      information will be used by Google Payments for the purpose of
      establishing your Carrier Billing Account as a Payment Instrument in your
      Google Payments Account, and for operating the Service. You also agree
      that GPC and your Carrier may share information with each other regarding
      your Carrier Billing activity in order to charge or credit your Carrier
      Billing Account and otherwise complete payments for purchases, reversals,
      refunds or adjustments of Payment Transactions, resolve disputes, provide
      customer support, and for other Carrier Billing-related purposes.</li>
    <li>When you choose to pay for a transaction with Carrier Billing, you
      authorize the Seller and GPC, as processor for the Seller, to submit
      charges and credits to your Carrier, and your Carrier to make such charges
      and credits to your Carrier Billing Account, as necessary to complete the
      Payment Transaction, or to complete the reversal, refund, or adjustment of
      that Payment Transaction.</li>
    <li>You can use Carrier Billing to purchase applications (e.g.,
      downloadable or networked applications, wallpapers, ring-tones, games, and
      productivity tools) (&quot;Apps&quot;) for and with your compatible device from
      certain merchants on Google Play. These Apps are not sold by your Carrier,
      Google, GPC, or Google Play. You can identify the Seller of the App at the
      point of purchase.</li>
    <li>Purchases made through Carrier Billing are also subject to the
      terms &amp; conditions of your Carrier Billing Account. You are
      responsible for any charges and related fees that may be imposed under
      your Carrier Billing Account terms &amp; conditions as a result of your
      use of Carrier Billing.</li>
    <li>You may contact your Carrier&#39;s customer service if you have a
      question about the charges or fees billed to your Carrier Billing Account.
      If you have a question regarding Google Payments related matters, you may
      contact Google Payments customer service.</li>
    <li>You should direct support questions regarding products, such as
      Apps, purchased through Carrier Billing to the Seller from whom you
      purchased the App.</li>
    <li>None of Carrier, Google, GPC, or Google Play is responsible for any
      product (including an App) purchased with Carrier Billing, including
      download, installation, use, transmission failure, interruption, or delay,
      refunds, third party advertisements you may encounter while using the
      product or App, alterations any App may make to the functionality of your
      device, including any changes that may affect your Carrier&#39;s plan,
      service, or billing, or any content or website you may be able to access
      through the App.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>3.3 Subscriptions/Recurring Transactions Purchases</p>
  <p>In the event that the Processing Service offers you the ability to pay
    for subscriptions, your subscription will start when you click &quot;Accept &amp;
    buy&quot; (or equivalent phrase)on a subscription purchase. This is a recurring
    billing transaction. Unless otherwise stated, your subscription and the
    relevant billing authorization will continue indefinitely until cancelled by
    you.</p>
  <p>By clicking &quot;Accept &amp; buy&quot;(or equivalent phrase),you authorize the
    applicable Seller to bill your chosen Payment Instrument each designated
    billing period for the subscription at the Purchase Amount. You further
    authorize the applicable Seller to charge the Purchase Amount to the
    alternate Payment Instrument, if you have selected one in your Google
    Payments Account, in the event that the Seller is unable to charge to your
    designated Payment Instrument for any reason.</p>
  <p>The Purchase Amount will continue to be charged to your designated
    Payment Instrument or alternate Payment Instrument (if applicable) each
    billing period, until you cancel your subscription, unless as otherwise
    stated in the terms and conditions.The Purchase Amount is subject to change
    by the Seller during the subscription period.</p>
  <p>Your Payment Instrument will be billed for the Purchase Amount each
    billing period based on the date of the subscription purchase.</p>
  <p>
    You may cancel a subscription at any time by following the process described
    <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/7018481?co%3DGENIE.Platform%253DAndroid%26hl%3Den&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1516224351896000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH9M02n_EqREGI6GnBO5KU5o7mtkQ" target="_blank">here</a>,
    but the cancellation will not become effective until the end of the current
    billing period. You will not receive a refund for the current billing
    period. You will continue to be able to access the relevant subscription for
    the remainder of the current billing period.
  </p>
  <p>We reserve the right to issue refunds or credits at our sole
    discretion. If we issue a refund or credit, we are under no obligation to
    issue the same or similar refund in the future.</p>

  <p>You may only use the Service to process a Payment Transaction for a
    Product that is purchased from a Seller through a legitimate, bona fide sale
    of the Product. The Service may not be used to process a Payment

    unrelated to a purchase of a Product. The Service may not be used to receive
    cash advances from Sellers or to facilitate the purchase of cash equivalents
    (travelers checks, prepaid cards, money orders, etc.). You may not use the
