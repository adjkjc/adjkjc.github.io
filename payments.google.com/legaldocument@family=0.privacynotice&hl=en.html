<h3>How we use the information that we collect</h3>
<p>In addition to the uses listed in the  <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1560897716615000" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a>, we use the information that you provide to us and to GPC or another of our subsidiaries, as well as information about you from third parties, in order to provide you with Google Payments for customer service purposes, and to prevent harm to the rights, property or safety of Google, our users, or the public, including to help prevent fraud, phishing or other misconduct.  Such information may also be used to assist third parties in the provision of products or services that you request from them. We also use the information to review your Google Payments Account to determine whether you continue to meet the terms of the account, to make decisions about your future Google Payments transactions, and for other legitimate business needs related to the Google Payments transactions initiated by you.</p>
<p> Your registration information is stored in association with your Google Account and your registration of a payment method will be stored on Google&#39;s servers. In addition, certain data elements may also be stored on your mobile device. We may retain the information that you provide for extended periods of time for the purpose of complying with legal process and regulatory obligations.</p>
<h3>Information that we share</h3>
<p> We will only share your personal information with other companies or individuals outside of Google in the following circumstances:</p>
<ul><li>As permitted under the  <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1560897716616000" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
<li>As necessary to process your transaction and maintain your account, including to provide security improvements and protect your account against fraud.</li>
<li> To complete your registration for a service provided by a third party.</li>
<li> To inform a third-party merchant, whose site or app you visit, whether you have a Google Payments account that can be used for making payment to that merchant.</li>
<li>With your card or other payment method&#39;s issuer and payment network, as well as payment processors and other organisations working on their behalf, to ensure the security and validity of the payment method and transactions requested using it.</li></ul>
<p>For example, when you make a purchase or transaction using Google Payments, we make certain personal information about you available to the company or individual you purchase from or transact with. This includes sharing your personal information with the developer from whom you purchased when you use Google Payments to make a purchase on Google Play. It may also include sending a merchant website or app your zip or postal code when you initiate a payment using a  &quot;Buy with Google Pay&quot; or similar button, so that the merchant can calculate tax or shipping costs for your purchase. When you add a third party payment method to your Google Payments Account, we may exchange certain personal information about you, such as your name, profile image, email, IP and billing address, phone number, device info, location and Google Account activity info, with the third-party payment provider as necessary to provide the service.</p>
<p> When you visit a participating merchant site or app, the merchant can check whether you have a Google Payments account with an eligible payment method that can be used to pay the merchant, in order to reduce the likelihood that you will see unusable features on sites or apps.</p>
<p> Any information that you provide directly to a third-party merchant, website or application is not covered by this privacy notice. We are not responsible for the privacy or security practices of merchants or other third parties with whom you choose to share your personal information directly. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any third party to whom you choose to share your personal information directly.</p>

Our affiliates, which can be financial and non-financial entities, will use such information for their everyday business purposes.</p>
<p>We provide you with the right to opt out of certain sharing between GPC and its affiliates. Specifically, you may choose to opt out of:</p>
<ul><li> Sharing between GPC and its affiliates of information about your creditworthiness for their everyday business purposes; and/or,</li>
<li> Our affiliates marketing their products or services to you based on your personal information that we collect and share with them. This information includes your account history with us.</li></ul>
<p> You may also choose to opt out of Google LLC or its affiliates informing a third-party merchant, whose site or app you visit, whether you have a Google Payments account that can be used for payment to that merchant.</p>
<p> If you choose to opt out, your choice will be effective until you tell us to change your choice.</p>
<p>If you don&#39;t want us to share personal information about your creditworthiness between GPC and its affiliates, or if you do not want our affiliates to use your personal information collected by us and shared with them to market to you, or if you do not want Google LLC or its affiliates to inform a third-party merchant, whose site or app you visit, whether you have a Google Payments account that can be used for payment to that merchant, please indicate your preference by logging in to your account, going to the  <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://payments.google.com/s/?page%3DprivacySettings%23privacySettings:&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1560897716618000" target="_blank">Google Payments privacy settings page</a>, and updating your preferences.</p><p> We will not share your personal information with anyone outside of GPC or with our affiliates except as described in this privacy notice.
