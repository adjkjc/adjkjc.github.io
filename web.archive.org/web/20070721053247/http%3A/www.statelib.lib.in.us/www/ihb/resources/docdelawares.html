      <hr>
      
      As Superintendent of Indian Affairs Governor Harrison
      enthusiastically implemented the aggressive policy of land
      acquisition authorized by the federal government. It was a case
      of hunting grounds versus cornfields. Indiana could not become
      a state so long as the Indians retained title. By a judicious
      mixture of persuasion and pressure Harrison secured the cession
      of approximately one-third of Indiana in a series of treaties
      from 1803 to 1809. In a treaty at Fort Wayne with "the
      Delawares, Putawatimies, Miamies, and Eel River Miamies" in the
      fall of 1809, he secured three million acres at an immediate
      cost of about one-third of a cent per acre. Indian opposition
      to cessions, led by Tecumseh and the Prophet, became
      increasingly bitter. As a result of the Treaty of 1809 Indian
      relations progressively deteriorated until Tecumseh's power was
      broken at the Battle of Tippecanoe. <sup>24

   <p><i>A treaty between the United States of America, and the
   tribes of Indians called the Delawares, Putawatimies, Miamies and
   Eel River Miamies. </i></p>
   
   <p>JAMES MADISON, President of the United States, by William Henry
   Harrison, governor and commander-in-chief of the Indiana
   territory, superintendent of Indian affairs, and commissioner
   plenipotentiary of the United States for treating with the said
   Indian tribes, and the Sachems, Head men and Warriors of the
   Delaware, Putawatame, Miami and Eel River tribes of Indians, have
   agreed and concluded upon the following treaty; which, when
   ratified by the said President, with the advice and consent of the
   Senate of the United States, shall be binding on said parties.</p>
   
   <p>ART. 1st. The Miami and Eel River tribes, and the Delawares and
   Putawatimies, as their allies, agree to cede to the United States
   all that tract of country which shall be included between the
   boundary line established by the treaty of Fort Wayne
   &#91;1803&#93;, the Wabash, and a line to be drawn from the mouth
   of a creek called Racoon Creek, emptying into the Wabash, on the
   south-east side, about twelve miles below the mouth of the
   Vermilion river, so as to strike the boundary line established by
   the treaty of Grouseland, at such a distance from its commencement
   at the north-east corner of the Vincennes tract, as will leave the
   tract now ceded thirty miles wide at the narrowest place. And also
   all that tract which shall be included between the following
   boundaries, viz.: beginning at Fort Recovery, thence southwardly
   along the general boundary line, established by the treaty of
   Greenville, to its intersection with the boundary line established
   by the treaty of Grouseland; thence along said line to a point
   from which a line drawn parallel to the first mentioned line will
   be twelve miles distant from the same, and along the said parallel
   line to its intersection with a line to be drawn from Fort
   Recovery, parallel to the line established by the said treaty of
   Grouseland.</p>
   
   <p>ART. 2d. The Miamies explicitly acknowledge the equal right of
   the Delawares with themselves to the country watered by the White
   river. But it is also to be clearly understood that neither party
   shall have the right of disposing of the same without the consent
   of the other: and any improvements which shall be made on the said
   land by the Delawares, or their friends the Mochecans, shall be
   theirs forever.</p>
   
   <p>ART. 3d. The compensation to be given for the cession made in
   the first article shall be as follows, viz.: to the Delawares a
   permanent annuity of five hundred dollars; to the Miamies a like
   annuity of five hundred dollars; to the Eel river tribe a like
   annuity of two hundred and fifty dollars; and to the Putawatimies
   a like annuity of five hundred dollars.</p>
   
   <p>ART 4th. All the stipulatioins made in the treaty of
   Greenville, relatively to the manner of paying the annuities, and
   the right of the Indians to hunt upon the land, shall apply to the
   annuities granted and the land ceded by the present treaty.</p>
   
   <p>ART. 5th The consent of the Wea tribe shall be necessary to
   complete the title to the first tract of land here ceded; a
   separate convention shall be entered into between them and the
   United States, and a reasonable allowance of goods given them in
   hand, and a permanent annuity, which shall not be less than three
   hundred dollars, settled upon them.</p>
   
   <p>ART. 6th The annuities promised by the third article, and the
   goods now delivered to the amount of five thousand two hundred
   dollars, shall be considered as a full compensation for the
   cession made in the first article.</p>
   
   <p>ART 7th. The tribes who are parties to this treaty being
   desirous of putting an end to the depredations which are committed
   by abandoned individuals of their own color, upon the cattle,
   horses, &amp;c. of the more industrious and careful, agree to
   adopt the following regulations, viz.: when any theft or other
   depredation shall be committed by any individual or individuals of
   one of the tribes above mentioned, upon the property of any
   individual or individuals of another tribe, the chiefs of the
   party injured shall make application to the agent of the United
   States, who is charged with the delivery of the annuities of the
   tribe to which the offending party belongs, whose duty it shall be
   to hear the proofs and allegations on either side, and determine
   between them: and the amount of his award shall be immediately
   deducted from the annuity of the tribe to which the offending
   party belongs, and given to the person injured, or to the chief of
   his village for his use.</p>
   
   <p>ART. 8th. The United States agree to relinquish their right to
   the reservation, at the old Ouroctenon towns, made by the treaty
   of Greenville, so far at least as to make no further use of it
   than for the establishment of a military post.</p>
   
   <p>ART. 9th. The tribes who are parties to this treaty, being
   desirous to show their attachment to their brothers the Kickapoos,
   agree to cede to the United States the lands on the north-west
   side of the Wabash, from the Vincennes tract to a northwardly
   extension of the line running from the mouth of the aforesaid
   Raccoon creek, and fifteen miles in width from the Wabash, on
   condition that the United States shall allow them an annuity of
   four hundred dollars. But this article is to have no effect unless
   the Kickapoos will agree to it.</p>
   
   <p>In testimony whereof, the said William Henry Harrison, and the
   sachems and war chiefs of the beforementioned tribes, have
   hereunto set their hands and affixed their seals, at fort Wayne,
   this thirtieth of September, eighteen hundred and nine.</p>
