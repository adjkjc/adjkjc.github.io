<p class="intro">The fall of New France and the end of French power in the interior
of the continent altered the geo-strategic situation for Aboriginal peoples
in the north-eastern portions of North America. Unfortunately for
Britain and for its Aboriginal allies, victory in the Seven Years’ War failed to
create prolonged peace in North America. Instead, Aboriginal communities
were forced into a series of wars over the next 55 years, first
against the British and later the new American Republic, for their
freedom, their lands and their survival.</p>
                  
<h2>Shifting Relationships</h2>

<p>In 1760-61, with the French threat gone, British officials
no longer felt obliged to accommodate Aboriginal
wishes. This was particularly evident among the western
nations of the Great Lakes and the Ohio valley that
had traditionally allied with France. British settlers from
the Thirteen Colonies, whose penetration of Aboriginal
lands in this area had previously been restricted by fear
of French and Indian attack, now flooded in unchecked.
They began to carve out farmsteads, in some cases without
first consulting the Miami, or Ottawa, or Wyandot
on whose land they settled. In other cases, shady and
competing land purchase deals were obtained by British land speculatiors.
This drastic transformation in Aboriginal relations with
the Europeans fostered a burning resentment amongst
Native peoples across the frontier. As one of the western
chiefs explained to his British counterpart:</p>

<p class="citation">… although you have conquered the French,
you have not yet conquered us! We are not your
slaves. These lakes, these woods, and mountains,
were left to us by our ancestors. They are
our inheritance; and we will part with them to
none. Your nation supposes that we, like the
white people, cannot live without bread – and
pork – and beef! But you ought to know, that
He, the Great Spirit and Master of Life, had
provided food for use, in these spacious lakes, and on these woody mountains.</p>

<p>Sir William Johnson, the superintendent of the Indian
Department, the Crown agency created in 1755 to manage
Aboriginal affairs in British North America, was aware
of this resentment. He warned the British commander-in-chief, Major-General Sir Jeffrey Amherst, that the
situation was serious, but Amherst was determined to
reduce expenditure in North America by stopping the traditional
practice of giving gifts. He viewed this practice
as mercenary; furthermore it was not his intention ‘to
gain the friendship of Indians by presents.’ Instead, he
calculated that a scarcity of supplies and ammunition
among the western nations, combined with a firm British
hand, would keep them quiet.</p>







<h2>The Pontiac Rebellion of 1763</h2>

<strong>Costume of Domiciliated Indians, c. 1807</strong><br />
Depicted in a temporary hunting and fishing camp, this 1807<br />
drawing by George Heriot shows aboriginal peoples of the<br /> 
early 19th century wearing and using a mixture of traditional <br />
and European clothing, tools and weapons. By the time of the <br />
War of 1812 many of the aboriginal groups in eastern Canada <br />
had chosen to live in fixed locations. <br />
<em>Library and Archives Canada (C-012781) </em>
</div>
<p>By the spring of 1763, widespread rumours and reports
suggested that the Aboriginal peoples were planning
an offensive against the British frontier. These rumours
were true. The so-called Pontiac Rebellion of 1763 was
another in a series of struggles by desperate Aboriginal
peoples to preserve their territory, independence and
culture against the pressure of European intrusion. In
May, an alliance of western nations came together under
the Ottawa chief, Pontiac. Pontiac’s primary target was
the principle British fort in the region at Detroit. Alerted
to his danger, the British commander managed to foil
Pontiac’s efforts to take the fort by subterfuge. Pontiac
was left with little choice but to lay siege. This was the
signal for the warriors of all the allied Aboriginal people
across the Great Lakes-Ohio region to strike, and the
results stunned the British. Unexpectedly, Aboriginal
warriors attacked and overwhelmed almost every British
fort in the area: Fort Sandusky fell to the Ottawa; Fort
St. Joseph to the Potawatomi; Fort Miami to the Miami;
Fort Ouiatenon to the Miami, Kickapoo and Illinois; Fort
Michilimakinaw to the Ojibwa; Fort Edward Augustus
to the Ottawa, Wyandot and Ojibwa; and Forts Venango,
La Boeuf and Presque’Ile to the Seneca and others. In
addition, warriors lashed out at the settlers in their midst,
killing up to two thousand in raids on farms and villages
in the Ohio valley that deadly summer.</p>

<strong>Sir William Johnson (1715-1774)</strong><br />
The first Superintendent of the British Indian Department, <br />
Johnson was instrumental in securing an alliance between <br />
the British crown and the Iroquois League of Six Nations <br />
that stood British interests in good stead during the <br />
Seven Years and American Revolutionary Wars. <br />
<em>Library and Archives Canada (C-005197)</em>
</div>

<p>Despite successes elsewhere, Pontiac’s failure to seize
Detroit gradually undermined his prestige and the power
and cohesion of his alliances dissipated. Sir William
Johnson, a resident of northern New York and connected
by marriage with the leadership of the Iroquois League
of Six Nations (the Tuscarora people having joined the
League in the 1720s), was able to conclude peace and
restore the traditional distribution of presents. More
importantly, shocked by the death and expense of war
with the still potent Aboriginal people of the continental
interior, the British crafted the Royal Proclamation of
1763. This important document established the colony
of Quebec and sought to establish regulations and rules
of conduct for dealings with the Indians in the fur trade
and in land deals. Moreover, it set a boundary between
the British colonies and a designated Indian Territory
into which White settlers were forbidden to trespass. This
and a subsequent treaty, signed at Fort Stanwix in 1768,
established a line from Oneida Lake, in northern New
York, southward to the Pennsylvania border and then
southwest, to and along the Ohio River, as the boundary
between non-Aboriginal and Aboriginal peoples.
These measures were intended to protect the nations of
the Great Lakes and provide for a peaceful and gradual
expansion of the frontier.</p>


<p>American colonists, covetous of the rich lands of the
interior, did not view this new territory in the same light.
They saw it as an arbitrary attempt by Great Britain
to limit their westward expansion. Effectively, Britain
found itself fulfilling the role previously occupied by
France as the barrier to American colonial expansion.
As it turned out, the settlement pressures to move across
the border into the Indian Territory were too great, and
the British government’s ability to control the frontier
was too limited. In the decade that followed the Pontiac
Rebellion, settlement continued to expand into what the
Americans considered the Northwest, despite the Royal
Proclamation. British efforts to control the frontier were
the first of many measures, including increased taxation,
which provoked widespread resentment and ultimately
resulted in American civil unrest.</p>



<h2>American Revolutionary War, 1775-1783</h2>
<div class="imageFrame">

<strong>Thayendanegea or Joseph Brant (1742-1807)</strong><br />
A war chief of the Mohawk nation, Thayendanegea led <br />
aboriginal forces in northern New York during the <br />
Revolutionary War. Following the British defeat he <br />
brought his people to Canada to settle along the <br />
banks of the Grand River and was prominent in <br />
aboriginal diplomacy in North America until his death. <br />
<em>Library and Archives Canada (C-011092)</em>
</div>
<p>The Thirteen Colonies moved toward an outright breach
with the British in the 1770s. Initially, both sides hoped
and intended that the Aboriginal people should remain
neutral. Soon both were competing to recruit Aboriginal
allies. Throughout the American Revolutionary War,
Aboriginal military power in the Great Lakes area
became a major consideration for British military leaders
in the northern theatre. The major diplomatic efforts
were directed at the League of Six Nations Iroquois,
which had largely remained neutral in European conflicts
since 1701. Although the League attempted to maintain
its neutral stance, it was dragged into the conflict and
torn asunder in its own civil war. Warriors from both the
Iroquois League and the Seven Nations of Canada were
instrumental in holding up a rebel offensive against a
weakly defended Canada in the autumn of 1775. The
delay forced the Americans to prolong their campaign
over the winter and ultimately to face defeat at the gates
of Quebec City. In the summer of 1777, a force of
British regulars, Loyalists and warriors won a notable
success at the battle of Oriskany, but Aboriginal allies
were less decisive in assisting the doomed offensive
led by Major-General John Burgoyne up the Champlain
Valley that autumn. Burgoyne’s defeat and surrender at
Saratoga brought France into the war on the side of the
rebellious colonies and the conflict broadened into a
general European war.</p>

<p>For the next five years, Britain’s Aboriginal allies in
the north, led by the Mohawk chief Thayandenaga, or
Joseph Brant, participated in a series of campaigns and
raids against the border settlements of New York and
Pennsylvania. Little quarter was given on either side.
Although the main focus of the larger conflict shifted to
the south in 1780, Britain’s Aboriginal allies won two
of their most notable successes – Sandusky and Blue
Licks – after the surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown in
1781. Aboriginal peoples also suffered fearsome losses.
The homelands of the Iroquois League were devastated
by an American punitive campaign in 1779, and perhaps
the worst depredation on either side was the massacre
by American troops of more than a hundred Christian
Delaware men, women and children at the Gnadehutten
Mission in the Ohio country in 1782.</p>

<p>Undefeated on the field of battle, Brant and his warriors
were appalled to learn of the terms of the 1783 Treaty
of Paris that ended the war and established a new international
border between Britain’s North American
possessions and her former colonies. Negotiated in
Europe by European and American statesmen, this treaty
did not include a single reference to the Aboriginal
nations who had participated in the conflict, although it
ceded the lands of those who had been allied with Britain
to the new American republic. As an officer of the Indian
Department reported to London, the Indians rightfully
felt betrayed by the terms of the treaty:</p>

<p class="citation">… [They] look upon our conduct to them as
treacherous and cruel: they told me they never
could believe that our King could pretend to
cede to America what was not his own to give
… they would defend their own Just Rights or
perish in the attempt to the last man, they were
but a handful of small People but they would
die like men, which they thought preferable to
misery and distress if deprived of their Hunting
Grounds.</p>

<p>This resentment was so strong that for a considerable
period after 1783 British authorities feared that their
former allies would attack them. Fortunately for the
war weary British, this did not happen. The British offered
land in Canada and financial compensation to the
Iroquois Loyalists, as they did to non-native Loyalists.
Brant, the Mohawk war chief, and Tekarihogen, the
peace chief, led 1,800 Mohawks, Cayuga and other Six
Nations people to a large tract of land on the Grand
River north of Lake Erie, while John Deserontyon
established a smaller and separate Mohawk community
at Tyendinaga on Lake Ontario’s Bay of Quinte. John
Graves Simcoe, the governor of the new colony of Upper
Canada (created in 1791), hoped that these new Aboriginal
settlements would provide an active barrier against possible
American aggression from the south.</p>



<h2>Trouble in the Northwest, 1783-1794</h2>

<strong> Officer, Indian Department. 1812</strong><br />
During the War of 1812, the aboriginal people of <br />
the Great Lakes area played an important role in <br />
defending Canada against American invasion. <br />
Warriors in the field were often accompanied by <br />
officers of the British Indian Department who <br />
spoke their language and knew their customs, and <br />
who served as liaison between aboriginal leaders <br />
and Britsh military commanders. This Indian <br />
Department officer is dressed practically for <br />
the field and wears a felt slouch hat, and old <br />
and patched uniform coatee, and laced rather <br />
than high riding boots. He would have little <br />
use for his sword in action but retains it as <br />
a symbol of his rank. <br />
<em>Painting by Ron Volstad [Department of National Defence]</em>
</div>
<p>Some of the Aboriginal peoples who had been allied
with Britain elected to remain in the new American
republic, a choice many came to regret. As soon as
the restraints stipulated in the Royal Proclamation of
1763 and the Treaty of Fort Stanwix of 1768 were
removed, the attitude of the American government was
that those nations who had fought for Britain during
the war were conquered peoples and their territory was
forfeit. American officials imposed severe treaties on
the Iroquois still resident in the United States, forcing
them off their traditional land onto reservations.
Ironically, those who suffered worst were the Oneida
and Tuscaroras who had supported the revolutionaries
during the war. The Americans had less luck with the
Algonkian and Iroquoian-speaking peoples further west
in the Ohio valley. More numerous, more united in the
defence of their territory, and further from the centres
of White population, these Aboriginal communities
refused to accept any change in the boundary of the
Ohio River, that had been established in the 1760s. The
victorious, but nearly bankrupt, American government
viewed this region as its birthright, its inheritance,
and needed the revenues from the sale of these lands
to pay its substantial war debts. The stage was set for
further conflict.</p>

<p>The nations of the Northwest (the modern states of
Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Ohio) formed a new
confederacy in 1786, which they called ‘The United
Indian Nations,’ to defend their land. The infant American
government, caught between a flood of settlers who
wanted to move into the Ohio area and the intractability
of Aboriginal peoples who wished to preserve that
river as their boundary, was forced into military action
after the Native Confederacy attacked illegal settlements
on their side of the river. In September 1790,
Brigadier-General Josiah Harmar was ordered ‘to
extirpate, if possible,’ the attackers. He set out from
Fort Washington (modern Cincinnati) with 1,400 regulars
and militia to invade the Miami nation. Within
three weeks, having suffered more than 200 casualties,
he was back at his base, with nothing accomplished
but the burning of a few abandoned villages.</p>

<p>American hopes for a quick victory were shattered. One
congressman brooded ‘a horid [sic] Savage war Stairs
[sic] us in the face.’ Instead of being humbled by the
Harmar expedition, the Confederacy ‘appear ditermined
[sic] on a general War.’ In the early summer of 1791,
Major-General Arthur St. Clair assembled a larger force,
consisting of 1500 regulars and 800 militia. His
advance was delayed while he trained an army consisting
of recruits who one of his staff characterized as ‘the
offscourings of large Towns and Cities; – enervated by
Idleness, Debaucheries and every species of Vice.’ St.
Clair began to creep forward in September, accompanied
by a lengthy procession of camp followers. Shortly after
sunrise on 4 November 1791, 2,000 warriors led by the
Confederacy’s war chiefs, the Shawnee, Blue Jacket and
the Miami under their warrior chief Michikinikwa (Little
Turtle), attacked St. Clair’s camp on the banks of the
Wabash River. Although, St. Clair, old, sick and feeble,
had neglected to post proper pickets around the badly
sited camp, the initial attacks were twice repulsed. At this
point, one witness recorded, the Ohio warriors, ‘irritated
beyond measure,’ simply pulled back to reorganise:</p>

<p class="citation">… a little distance, where separating into their
different tribes and each conducted by their own
Leaders, they returned like Furies to the assault
&amp; almost instantly got possession of near half
the Camp – they found it in a row of Flour Bags,
&amp; bags of Stores, which serv’d them as a Breast
work, from behind which kept up a constant &amp;
heavy fire, the Americans charg’d them several
times with Fixed Bayonets, but were as often
repuls’d – at length General Butler, second in
Command, being kill’d, the Americans fell into
confusion &amp; were driven from their Cannon,
round which a Hundred of their bravest Men
fell, the Rout now became universal, &amp; in the
utmost disorder, the Indians follow’d for Six
Miles &amp; many fell Victims to their Fury.</p>

<p>When it was over, 647 American soldiers were dead, 229
wounded and all St. Clair’s camp stores and 21 pieces of
artillery lost. Aboriginal casualties were estimated at 50
warriors killed and wounded. The Battle of the Wabash
was the single greatest victory by Aboriginal peoples
against the armed forces of the United States.</p>

<p>Following that triumph, the Northwest Confederacy
ravaged the White settlements on their side of the 1768
boundary for nearly two years, but refrained from
attacking American territory. Throughout its struggle,
the Confederacy received advice from the British Indian
Department officers at Detroit, but their requests for
active military support were denied, even though Britain
had retained its posts south of the border. Britain offered
to mediate in the contest and suggested the establishment
of an independent and neutral Aboriginal state between
the Mississippi, the Ohio and the Great Lakes. Not surprisingly,
the American government firmly rejected this
proposal, which it regarded as unwanted meddling. For
nearly three years, Britain, the United States, the Confederacy,
and the Six Nations of Canada under Joseph Brant
tried to end the controversy over the boundary through
a series of conferences, but the Aboriginal peoples of
the Northwest remained adamant that the Ohio River
continue to be the dividing line.</p>

<p>The Confederacy’s desires for independence were shattered
in 1794 when a new and well-trained American
army under Major-General Anthony Wayne advanced
into their territory and defeated a series of Aboriginal
attacks, culminating in the major American victory at
the battle of Fallen Timbers in August. When British
military commanders refused military aid to retreating
Aboriginal warriors, the Confederacy began to disintegrate.
Tensions between Britain and the United States,
which had come close to the point of troubles in the
Northwest and maritime matters on the high seas, were
ameliorated with the signing of Jay’s Treaty in 1794.
The British turned over the posts they had retained on
American territory in return for guarantees that British
subjects and Aboriginal peoples could pass freely
over the border. For the Aboriginal Confederacy, the
result was despair: the British had abandoned them for
a second time. Some fled to Canada, but most signed a
general peace treaty with Wayne in 1795 that ceded the
Ohio valley to the American government. Their 12-year
stand against the United States had failed, but it provided
ample time for the infant province of Upper Canada to take root and prosper.</p>



<h2>Tecumseh, His Confederacy and the
Road to War</h2>

<strong>Tecumseh (1768-1813)</strong><br />
The Shawnee Chief Tecumseh dreamed of forming <br />
a confederacy of all the aboriginal nations from <br />
the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico. He brought his <br />
followers to the British side in the War of 1812, <br />
but military reverses led to his death in battle in<br /> 
1813. There is no known picture of Tecumseh but most <br /> 
specialists agree that this sketch, drawn from an <br />
eyewitness description of the man, is the closest likeness. <br />
<em>Library and Archives Canada (C-000319)</em>
</div>
<p>For nearly a decade after the battle of Fallen Timbers,
there was relative peace in the Northwest. White settlers
flooded into the area and the new American territories
of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Ohio were established.
By 1810, some 200 000 Americans lived in Ohio alone.
The Northwest nations had not forgotten their humiliation,
however. They began to pay greater attention to
an impressive young Shawnee named Tecumseh, who
urged the creation of a single native confederacy
stretching from the Canadian border to Spanish territory
in Mexico that would be strong enough to resist
the encroachment of the ‘Big Knives,’ as he termed the
Americans. Tecumseh travelled ceaselessly, spreading
his message to the Aboriginal peoples from the Great
Lakes to the mouth of the Mississippi river. But while
Tecumseh gave his listeners hope for the future he also
advised them not to engage in warfare with the Americans
until the time was right.</p>

<p>Not surprisingly the popularity of the charismatic Tecumseh
worried American frontier officials. Governor William
Henry Harrison of the Indiana Territory met with Tecumseh
twice in vain attempts to reduce the increasing tension
between the Aboriginal peoples and White settlers,
and he was both impressed and concerned:</p>

<p class="citation">The implicit obedience and respect which the
followers of Tecumseh pay to him, is really
astonishing, and more than any other circumstance
bespeaks him one of those uncommon
geniuses which spring up occasionally to produce
revolutions, and overturn the established
order of things. If it were not for the vicinity of
the United States, he would, perhaps, be the founder 
of an empire that would rival in glory
Mexico or Peru. No difficulties deter him. For
four years he has been in constant motion. You
see him to-day on the Wabash, and in a short
time hear of him on the shores of Lake Erie or
Michigan, or on the banks of the Mississippi;
and wherever he goes he makes an impression
favorable to his purposes. He is now upon the
last round to put a finishing stroke to his work.</p>

<strong>Which is Tecumseh?</strong><br />
Pictured above are two varying depictions of <br />
Tecumseh. The sketch at left depicts Tecumseh in <br />
traditional dress and was drawn in 1808. The <br />
1848 painting at right by Benson Lossing was <br />
based on the former sketch but this version <br />
depicts Tecumseh in the uniform of a British <br />
general as was the popular (but untrue) belief <br />
of the time. Also note that Tecumseh is pictured <br />
sporting a “nose ring” which was usually not <br />
depicted in drawings of aboriginal peoples of <br />
this period.
</div>
<p>In the autumn of 1811, Harrison decided to make a preemptive
strike against this latest Confederacy. In early
November, while Tecumseh was absent on a journey to the south, 
he moved a force of regulars and militia near
the village of Tippecanoe (near modern Lafayette, Indiana)
established by Tecumseh’s brother, Tenskwatawa
or the Prophet. The Prophet was unable to restrain his
warriors and sniping between sentries escalated into a
pitched battle that was won by the Americans. Many
of the defeated fled to the safety of Canada. When
Tecumseh returned to the area early in 1812, he set out to
rebuild his Confederacy and to placate American authorities.
At the same time, he sought the assistance of British
officers of the Indian Department who listened to him
partly because they were convinced that war between
Britain and the United States was at hand.</p>


<p>Although Tecumseh still counselled peace, he also believed
that war was imminent and promised his Confederacy
would ally itself with Britain in the forthcoming
contest. He expressed to the Indian Department officers
that ‘if their father the King should be in earnest and
appear in sufficient force, they would hold fast by him.’
Tecumseh also stated that his followers were determined
to defend their land and, although they did not expect
Britain to engage in military operations, they did expect
logistical support – ‘you will push forward towards us
what may be necessary to supply our wants.’ For their
part, the Indian Department cautioned the Confederacy
not to attack until war was declared. As one officer put
it, ‘Keep your eyes fixed on me; my tomahawk is now
up; be you ready, but do not strike until I give the
signal.’ Tecumseh agreed with this advice, but warned
the British that:</p>

<p class="citation"> If we hear of the Big Knives coming towards our
villages to speak peace, we will receive them, but
if We hear of any of our people being hurt by
them, or if they unprovokedly advance against
us in a hostile manner, be assured we will defend
ourselves like men. And if we hear of any
of our people having been killed, We will immediately
send to all the Nations on or towards
the Mississippi, and all this Island will rise as
one man.</p>

<strong>Plan of the Grand River and Location of Six Nations of Indians,<br /> 
as found settled by the Reverend RT Lugger, February, 26th, 1828.</strong> <br />
As it was designed to do from the time of its founding in 1784, <br /> 
the original Grand River tract provided a military corridor which  <br />
effectively checked potential invasion from either the Detroit-Windsor <br /> 
frontier to the west, or from the Niagara frontier to the east.  <br />
As with neighbouring Anishinabeg groups, Grand River fighters were <br />  
successfully mobilized in the Crown interest in the War of 1812  <br />
and again during the Rebellions of 1837-1838. Their proximity in <br /> 
relation to government and population centres, military garrisons, <br /> 
transportation and communication routes, and frontiers with the U.S., <br /> 
and their economic adaptations arising from these situations, <br /> 
influenced the manner in which First Nations might subsequently <br />support 
 the Crown militarily during war and conflicts other than war. <br />

</div>
<p>Throughout this period, the Indian Department had
continued to provide annual gifts, including weapons
and shot, to Aboriginal peoples in the United States
and shelter for refugees from the struggles below
the border. Such activities were regarded with great
suspicion by American officials. Although some
Aboriginal warriors residing in Canadian territory had
participated in the fighting in the Ohio valley, their
leaders in Canada encouraged the peaceful resolution
of the differences between the Northwest nations and
the Americans. The Seven Nations of Canada and the
Iroquoian peoples in Upper Canada had seen enough
conflict in the previous century and preferred to stay
out of Anglo-American quarrels.</p>

<p>This desire to remain neutral became difficult, however,
as Britain and the United States drifted toward war in
the first decade of the 19th Century. The origins of the
tensions between the two were, as usual, to be found
in Europe. In 1793, revolutionary France had declared
war on Britain, initiating a struggle that would ensue,
with a brief intermission, for 23 years. Both countries
had adopted restrictive maritime policies, forbidding the
ships of neutral nations that traded with one belligerent
from trading with the other. These measures severely
curtailed the profits of American merchants. Since the
British were supreme at sea, particularly after Nelson’s
great naval victory at Trafalgar in 1805, American resentment
was exacerbated by the Royal Navy’s penchant for stopping American vessels on the high seas and forcibly
impressing their sailors, some who were British deserters,
into British service. Many also suspected that Britain
was promoting trouble in the Northwest by actively supporting
the nations of Tecumseh’s Confederacy. Britain,
pre-occupied with the war in Europe, seemed oblivious
to American concerns. A few weeks after the battle of
Tippecanoe in 1811, President James Madison of the
United States, convinced that war was the only way
that his country could resolve its grievances, decided to
put the republic ‘in armour’ and prepare for hostilities
against Britain. Given the overwhelming strength of the
Royal Navy, the United States had only one practical
military option: an attack on Canada.</p>

<h2>The Coming of War in 1812</h2>

<p>Lieutenant-General Sir George Prevost, governor-general
and commander-in-chief of the British colonies
in North America, knew that because of British military
commitments in Europe he could not expect massive
troop reinforcements. Prevost had about 5,600 regular
soldiers in Upper and Lower Canada, backed up by
some 60,000 militia in the lower province and 11,000
in the upper. Faced by an enemy population estimated
to be more than seven million, his plan was to abandon
Upper Canada, which was surrounded on three sides
by American territory, and pull back to Montreal and,
if necessary, Quebec, until he could be reinforced from
Britain. This cautious defensive strategy was opposed by
Major-General Isaac Brock, Prevost’s subordinate commander
in Upper Canada. Brock argued that the upper
province could be successfully defended if the Aboriginal
nations in the Northwest were encouraged to attack
the frontier settlements in that area, disrupting possible
American invasion plans. Brock recognized, however,
that before the British could ‘expect an active cooperation
on the part of the Indians, the reduction of Detroit
and Michilimackinac must convince that people, who
conceive themselves to have been sacrificed in 1794, to
our policy, that we are earnestly engaged in war.’</p>

The warriors from the small Mohawk community at <br />
Tyendinaga near Kingston, although few in numbers, <br />
participated in much fighting during the War of <br />
1812, seeing action at Sacketts Harbor and in the <br />
Niagara peninsula in 1813. Their most prominent <br />
service was rendered at the battle for Crysler’s <br />
Farm in November,1813 where they played a role <br />
disproportional of their numbers. This warrior is <br />

</div>
<p>In the six months preceding the American declaration
of war in June 1812, Indian Department officers were
secretly active among Native peoples on both Canadian
and American territory, where they estimated they might
be able to call on the support of as many as 10,000
warriors. The largest proportion, 8,410 according to
the Department, would come from the western nations
whose own conflict with the Americans made them
‘amicable to the Cause.’ There were far fewer warriors
available on Canadian territory. The Seven Nations
of Canada were estimated to be only 1,040 strong,
while in Upper Canada the Iroquois people on the
Grand River and at Tyendinaga, and the Mississaugas
and Ojibwa peoples, could only contribute 550 men.
While the western nations were mostly prepared to ally
themselves with the British, the Aboriginal peoples in
Canada proved more equivocal.</p>



<p>This uncertain response was particularly evident in the
Grand River nations, the strongest Aboriginal force in
the Canadas, who adopted a neutral stance toward the
forthcoming conflict at the urging of their fellow Iroquois
who lived in American territory. The Six Nations had
longstanding grievances against officials of the British
Indian Department, whom they suspected were profiting
from the sale of their lands to the whites. Even
Brock’s promise to investigate these grievances and, if
appropriate, adjust them in their favour failed to change
their stance. More persuasive to the Six Nations was the
argument made by a delegation of Cayuga and Onondaga
chiefs from the United States who visited the Grand
River in June 1812 to advise caution:</p>

<p class="citation">We have come from our homes to warn you,
that you may preserve yourselves and families
from distress. We discover that the British and
Americans are on the Eve of a War, – they are
in dispute respecting some rights on the Sea,
with which we are unacquainted; – should it
end in a Contest, let us keep aloof: – Why should
we again fight, and call upon ourselves the
resentment of the Conquerors? We know that
neither of these powers have any regard for us
… except when they want us. Why then should
we endanger the comfort, even the existence of
our families, to enjoy their smiles only for the
Day in which they need us?</p>



<p>The majority of the Six Nations living along the Grand
felt that this was sound reasoning for keeping out of
the white man’s quarrels, despite the exhortations of a
smaller pro-British faction led by John Norton, Teyoninhokarawen,
or the Snipe. The son of a Cherokee father
and a Scottish mother, Norton had become a respected
leader amongst the Six Nations, and by 1812 was a
prominent war chief. The Grand River nations were
going to remain neutral and Norton was forced to report
to Brock that the community was divided, but that, if
threatened by American invasion, ‘I have no doubts
they are not so depraved as to be faithless.’</p>

<p>On 18 June 1812 the United States declared war on
Great Britain. American leaders were confident: ‘the
acquisition of Canada this year will be a mere matter of
marching’ boasted former President Thomas Jefferson.
Reality proved different. In 1812, the outnumbered
British, Canadian and Aboriginal fighters won a series of
critical battles that stopped the Americans in their tracks
for that year and consolidated the Anglo-Aboriginal
alliance in the Great Lakes-Ohio country.</p>

<p>Impelled by urgent requests from territorial governors in
the Northwest concerned about preserving their frontier
settlements against Tecumseh and his allies, the Americans
planned their main thrust in the Detroit area. Thus,
from the outset of the war, American strategic thinking
was influenced by the need to reduce what was perceived
as a dangerous Aboriginal threat in the Northwest, and
deflected from the more decisive objective – the vulnerable
St. Lawrence waterway. When war broke out,
Brigadier-General William Hull was stationed at Detroit
with the better part of the American regular forces and
substantial militia under his command. This policy did
not change throughout the war and was, perhaps more
than military prowess and victories, the major contribution
of the Aboriginal peoples to the successful defence
of Canada.</p>

<p>On 17 July, a small British force consisting of a few
regulars, fur traders, and 130 Menominee, Winnebago
and Sioux warriors surrounded the American fort on
Mackinac Island which guarded the water passage to
Lake Michigan and persuaded the American commander
to surrender without a fight. Although Hull had crossed
the Detroit River with the bulk of his command on
12 July, capturing the village of Sandwich, this early
victory convinced the peoples of the Northwest that the
British were serious and they began to threaten Hull’s
supply lines, forcing him to withdraw from Canada and
take up a defensive position at Detroit on 8 August. By
early August, contingents under Tecumseh’s leadership
actively prowled around the American position and
attacked supply columns. Hull began to lose his nerve.
The victory at Mackinac had given Brock one of the
two objectives he regarded as necessary to secure the
support of the Northwest peoples, and it was already
paying dividends.</p>

<p>Brock’s other objective was Detroit. In early August, he
moved west to Amherstburg with a force of regulars and
militia to join some 600 Northwest warriors. There, on
13 August, he met Tecumseh for the first time, and the
two men liked and trusted each other from the outset.
Brock wrote to Prevost that ‘a more sagacious or a more
gallant Warrior’ than the Shawnee chief ‘does not I
believe exist.’ Their combined force of British regulars,
Canadian militia and Aboriginal warriors then advanced
on Detroit where Hull, convinced he was surrounded
by superior numbers of British regulars and warriors,
became increasingly distraught. He was even less happy
when he received a letter from Brock containing the grim
hint that, since ‘the numerous body of Indians who have
attached themselves to my troops, will be beyond control
the moment the contest commences,’ Hull should surrender
in order ‘to prevent the unnecessary effusion of
blood.’ The American commander at first refused, but
after British artillery opened fire, he agreed to surrender
his 2,000 well-entrenched men to Brock and the 1,300
British, militia and Aboriginal fighters under his command.
Brock’s bluff had paid off and the only field force
in the American army marched into captivity. The victory
at Detroit, coming on the heels of the success at Mackinac
electrified both the European and Aboriginal peoples of
Upper Canada and the Great Lakes-Ohio region, many
of whom had assumed that the province would succumb
to overwhelming enemy strength.</p>

<p>Though shaken by their early defeats, the Americans
would not give up easily. In late September and early
October, American troops began massing on the Niagara
frontier. To meet this threat, Brock moved the greater
part of his forces to Fort George, near Newark (now
Niagara-on-the-Lake). He was joined there by Norton
and a force of Grand River warriors who, buoyed by
the victories in the west, had decided to take an active
role in the defence of Canada. Norton was at Newark
on the morning of 13 October when information came
that the American forces had crossed the Niagara River
and established themselves in the village of Queenston,
seven miles south. He was ordered to assemble his warriors
and move to the threatened spot, learning on the
way that Brock had been killed leading a counterattack
and that the invaders were in a strong position on the
heights above Queenston. The Americans at Queenston
outnumbered British forces and it would be some time
before reinforcements of regular troops would arrive.
Norton’s men hesitated, but one of his warriors urged
his ‘Comrades and Brothers’ to:</p>

<p class="citation">… be Men; – remember the fame of ancient
Warriors, whose Breasts were never daunted
by odds of number; – We have found what we
came for … there they are, – it only remains
to fight …. Look up, it is He above who shall
decide our fate. Our gallant friends the Red
Coats, will soon support us.</p>

<p>The war party ascended the heights by a little known
path, flanking the American position and proceeded to
snipe and harass the Americans from behind with ‘coolness
&amp; Spirit’ until British reinforcements arrived.</p>

<p>At that point a general attack commenced against the
invaders that pushed them back to the edge of the cliffs
overlooking the Niagara gorge. John Norton recorded
the final moments of the battle.</p>

<p class="citations">We rushed forward, &amp; saw the Grenadiers led
by Lt. Bullock coming from the right along the
Bank of the River; – the Enemy disappeared
under the Bank; many plunging into the River.
The inconsiderate still continued to fire at them
[in the water], until checked by repeated commands
of “Stop Fire.” The White Flag from the
American General then met General Sheaffe
[the British successor to Brock], proposing to
Surrender at Discretion the remainder of those
who had invaded us. The Prisoners amounted
to about Nine Hundred.</p>

<p>The Battle of Queenston Heights was an overwhelming
victory, but the death of Brock, as Norton remembered,
‘threw a gloom over the sensations which this brilliant
Success might have raised.’</p>

<h2>1813: Triumphs and Disasters</h2>

<p>The tide of British and Aboriginal victories continued
into early 1813 on the western frontier. The loss of
Detroit was a major setback for the United States and
Madison’s government immediately began planning a
counter-attack. William Henry Harrison, the popular
and effective governor of the Indiana Territory, was
given command of a force of 6,000 regulars and militia
with orders to break the power of the Northwest nations
and retake Detroit. One of his subordinates, Brigadier-General James Winchester, became impatient and
pressed on to the British outpost of Frenchtown on the
River Raisin, about forty kilometres southwest of
Detroit. The new British commander on the western
frontier, Brigadier-General Henry Procter, assembled a
force of 550 regulars and militia and about 600 warriors
from the Northwest nations and defeated Winchester
on 22 January.</p>

<p>In the wake of the victory, Procter neglected to guard
his prisoners and a party of Pottawatomi and Wyandot
warriors killed about thirty wounded Americans. Warfare
on the frontier between Native peoples and newcomers
had long been characterised by viciousness and the
calculated use of terror by both sides, and this war was
no different. The Americans, particularly the frontier
militia, neither gave nor expected quarter, determined as
they were to annihilate the Aboriginal threat in the area.
Northwest peoples, who regarded the war as a struggle
for survival, responded in kind. The cruel nature of the
conflict was aptly summed up by Assiginack, or Black
Bird, an Ottawa chief, in a speech addressed to the
officers of the Indian Department who had admonished
him for not restraining his warriors’ excesses in battle.</p>

<p class="citation">We have listened to your words, which words
come from our father. We will now say a few
words to you. At the foot of the Rapids last
spring we fought the Big Knives, and we lost
some of our people there. When we retired the
Big Knives got some of our dead. They were not
satisfied with having killed them, but cut them
into small pieces. This made us very angry. My
words to my people were: ‘As long as the powder
burnt, to kill and scalp,’ but those behind us
came up and did mischief. Last year at Chicago

after they kill people of our colour, leave them

<p>Although there may have been isolated incidents of this
type, John Norton felt it ‘would be useless as well as
endless to repeat the number of cruelties that had been
asserted, &amp; as bluntly contradicted, – without proofs to
substantiate either on one Side or the other.’ Regardless
of proof, greatly exaggerated accounts of the Frenchtown
massacre circulated in the United States, stoking the fires
of vengeance.</p>

<p>Frenchtown was not the only victory the defenders of
Upper Canada gained that winter. On the morning of
22 February, a combined British/Canadian force that
included thirty Tyendinaga Mohawk warriors crossed
the ice of the frozen St. Lawrence and took the American
village of Ogdensburg after a short but sharp battle.
Thereafter, the tide began to turn as the United States
successfully mobilized its superior manpower to launch
major offensives. At the end of April 1813, an American
amphibious expedition attacked York, overwhelming the
defenders who included forty Ojibway and Mississauga
warriors. The Americans captured and burned the capital
of Upper Canada.</p>



<p>A month later, the Americans made another successful
landing at Fort George, at the mouth of the Niagara
River, forcing the British and their Aboriginal allies
in the Niagara peninsula to retreat west to where the
modern city of Hamilton stands. A British victory
during the night action fought at Stoney Creek on 6 June,
however, caused the invaders to withdraw to the fortified
camp they had constructed near Fort George and it was
not long before British regulars and Canadian militia,
together with their Aboriginal allies, closed in around
the American position.</p>

<p>The American commander, Major-General Henry Dearborn,
responded by mounting an expedition against
De Cew’s House. This post was known to be the
forward supply depot for the aboriginal warriors
harassing his positions and was garrisoned by about
fifty British soldiers under the command of Lieutenant
James FitzGibbon. Unbeknownst to the Americans, a
contingent composed of 200 Grand River warriors,
180 Seven Nations warriors, and 70 Ojibway and
Mississaugas from Upper Canada, led by Dominique
Ducharme and John Brant, were encamped about two
kilometres east of FitzGibbon’s post, near an area of
ponds and streams known as the Beaver Dams (close to
what is now the modern city of St. Catharines).</p>

<p>On 23 June, a force of 600 American regular infantry
and cavalry with three pieces of artillery, marched out of
Fort George for De Cew’s House under the command of
Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Boerstler. Contact was made
just after dawn the next day, when Ducharme and Brant
sprung an ambush from the woods lining both sides of
the road through the Beaver Dams. The allied warriors
devastated the American advance guard of regular cavalry,
and then advanced through the cover of the woods
on the American main force that was deploying. Though
American musketry and cannon inflicted casualties,
the warriors sniping and ‘their horrible yells terrified
the enemy so much that they retired precipately’ into
a hollow where they were then surrounded. Two hours
later Lieutenant FitzGibbon carried a flag of truce. He
informed Boerstler that the Americans were surrounded,
not only by warriors from the Canadas but also those
from the Northwest who were ‘by no means as easily
controlled,’ and, as they ‘had suffered very severely
they were outrageous and would commence a general
massacre’ if Boerstler did not immediately yield. The
Americans surrendered. FitzGibbon later wrote:</p>

<p class="citation">With respect to the affair with Captain [sic]
Boerstler, not a shot was fired on our side by
any but the Indians. They beat the American
detachment into a state of terror, and the only
share I claim is taking advantage of a favourable
moment to offer them protection from the
tomahawk and scalping knife.</p>

<p>The Battle of the Beaver Dams was one of the most
notable Aboriginal victories of the War of 1812 – for
a cost of not more than twenty killed and wounded,
the warriors had killed, wounded or captured 600
American soldiers.</p>

<p>The twin victories at Stoney Creek and Beaver Dams
blunted the American campaign in the Niagara peninsula,
but to the west, Procter and Tecumseh, after a deep, but
unsuccessful, offensive into the Ohio Territory, were
forced back to Amherstburg. Even this position soon
proved untenable as the British supply lines depended 
on their naval control of Lake Erie. The Americans had
been feverishly constructing a squadron of warships
at Presque’ Isle, on the southern shore of that lake to
mount a challenge. In early September, they managed to
wrest control of the Lake after sinking or capturing the
British squadron in battle. When news of this disaster
reached Procter, he decided to retreat toward Burlington
Bay (now Hamilton Harbour). He neglected, however,
to inform Tecumseh or the thousands of warriors
and their families camped in and around Amherstburg.
Their suspicions became aroused, however, when they
saw the British dismantling the fortifications of the post
and loading supplies and ammunition into wagons for
a retreat. At a council between Procter, his officers and
the Aboriginal leaders, held on 18 September 1813,
Tecumseh delivered a stinging rebuke to his British ally
that summarized the disappointments and disasters that
regularly occurred when Aboriginal peoples became
involved in European conflicts. In what later became
known as the ‘yellow dog’ speech, Tecumseh castigated
Proctor by likening him to ‘a fat animal that carries its
tail upon its back; but when affrighted, it drops it between
its legs and runs off.’</p>

<p>Procter’s mind was made up, however, and in late September
his small army commenced a retreat towards
Lake Ontario, accompanied by the reluctant Tecumseh
and those of his followers who had not gone home in
disgust at what they saw as another British betrayal. On
5 October, Tecumseh’s old opponent, Major-General
William Henry Harrison, caught up with them near the
Moraviantown mission on the Thames River. Procter
deployed his regular infantry badly and they were run
down by Harrison’s mounted troops, at which point the
British general fled the battle. Tecumseh and his warriors
fought well enough to let many of their British allies
escape before they stubbornly retired through the woods.
Tecumseh was not with them – killed during the battle,
his body was spirited away by his warriors to be placed in
an unknown grave. Harrison’s victorious troops included
many Kentucky frontiersmen who displayed ‘peculiar
Cruelty to the Families of the Indians who had not Time
to escape, or conceal Themselves.’ The Americans
remained in control of the southwestern portions of
Upper Canada until the end of the conflict.</p>

<p>The last months of the year brought renewed success
to British arms. In October and November, two American
armies moving on Montreal were stopped by the
twin victories at Chateauguay and Crysler’s Farm and
Aboriginal warriors participated in both actions. But
the disastrous defeat at the Thames, and the death of
Tecumseh, marked the end of the military power of
the Northwest peoples. Although some of the nations
continued to fight on, and achieved some success at
Prairie du Chien on the upper Mississippi in 1814,
most of the nations either made a separate peace with
the United States or fled to British territory.</p>

<h2>The End of the War and the Treaty
of Ghent</h2>

<p>By 1814, the third year of the war, military campaigns
were waged largely by increasing numbers of British and
American regular troops who engaged in a number of
pitched battles in the Niagara peninsula and Lake Champlain
valley. Although the Aboriginal nations from the
Northwest and their allies from the Canadas participated
in some of these engagements, they did so as auxiliaries
and their activities were less crucial to the outcomes of
the battles.</p>

<p>In August 1814, negotiations to end the war began in the
Dutch city of Ghent. Mindful of the disastrous omission
of the Aboriginal peoples from the Treaty of Paris, which
had ended the Revolutionary War, the British negotiators
came to the table demanding that the Aboriginal allies
of Great Britain should be included in the treaty and ‘a
definite boundary to be settled for their territory.’ The
Americans were even more shocked when they learned
that ‘the object of the British government was, that the
Indians should remain as a permanent barrier between
our western settlements, and the adjacent British province,’
and that neither nation ‘should ever hereafter have the
right to purchase, or acquire any part of the territory thus
recognized, as belonging to the Indians.’ The British
position was totally unacceptable to the United States,
who had about a hundred thousand citizens living in
the proposed Indian Territory. Negotiations stalled as
a result.</p>

<p>After much discussion on the subject, the American delegates
suggested instead that the final treaty include ‘a
reciprocal and general stipulation of amnesty covering
all persons, red as well as white, in the enjoyment of
rights possessed at the commencement of the war.’ The
British negotiators rejected this but, after consultation
with London, they were instructed to drop the demand
for the creation of a barrier state. Instead, they propose
the following article for inclusion in the treaty:</p>

<p class="citation">The United States of America engage to put
an end immediately after the ratification of the
present Treaty, to hostilities with all the Tribes
or Nations of Indians, with whom they may be
at war at the time of such ratification, and forthwith
to restore to such Tribes or Nations respectively
all the possessions, rights and privileges,
which they may have enjoyed or been entitled
to in 1811, previous to the hostilities. <br /><br />
Provided always, that such Tribes or Nations
shall agree to desist from all hostilities against
the United States of America, their Citizens,
and subjects, upon the ratification of the present
Treaty being notified to such Tribes or Nations,
and shall so desist accordingly.</p>

<strong>Historical Indian Treaties</strong><br />
Following the War of 1812, British North American and U.S. <br />
border tensions stabilized somewhat while Aboriginal populations <br />
continued to decline and non-Aboriginal immigration increased <br />
dramatically. No longer courted as economic partners in <br />
peacetime, nor as military allies during war, British North <br />
American colonial governments came to regard First Nations <br />
as impediments to agricultural and industrial development. <br />
The subsequent expansion of the Canadian confederation was <br />
premised upon the assimilation of Aboriginal peoples and the <br />
attainment of their lands by treaty, legislation or otherwise. <br />
During this era, the extent to which Aboriginal peoples <br />
attempted to – or were permitted to – participate in various <br />
domestic or imperial military undertakings in support of the <br />
Crown varied from region to region and from decade to decade. <br />

<p>There is little doubt that the Aboriginal peoples
contemplated by the authors of this draft article were
those residing on American territory, particularly those
Northwest nations of Tecumseh’s Confederacy. The
specific reference to the year 1811, when conflict broke
out in the northwest, and not 1812 when the United
States had declared war on Britain, makes this clear.
After much discussion the American delegates accepted
this proposal and it appeared as Article IX of the Treaty
of Ghent, which was signed on Christmas Eve, 1814.
Three days later, the British government sent a copy of
the treaty to Sir George Prevost and drew his attention
to the articles relating to Aboriginal peoples ‘that may be
at war with either of the two contracting parties.’ Prevost
was told to assure them that the Crown ‘would not
have consented to make peace with the United States of
America unless those Nations or tribes which had taken
part with us, had been included in the Pacification.’
He was to use his ‘utmost endeavours’ to induce the
Aboriginal peoples living in the United States to conclude
separate peace treaties with the American government
‘as we could not be justified in offering them further
assistance if they should persist in Hostilities.’</p>

<p>
The War of 1812 secured the continued existence of
British North America under British rule, and the role
played by Aboriginal warriors in that defence had been
substantial. Indeed in some of the early battles it had
been decisive. Unfortunately, the outcome of the war
was less positive for the Aboriginal peoples of the
Great Lakes-Ohio region, as it marked the end of their
long efforts to defend their autonomy and homelands
from the European and American settlement frontier.
Thereafter, the Native peoples of the Northeastern
portions of the continent would not be able to defend
themselves by military means. Yet 1815 would not be
the last time that Aboriginal peoples were called upon
to defend Canada.</p>
