		<blockquote><p>Here is <i>light</i>, for in this Garden filled with knowledge and history, just hidden enough to not be seen, and loud enough to know that its absence is not natural, nor is it beneficial to continue&#8211;from nearly any angle.  You see in this Garden the all seeing clearly does not need to seek Adam, who is the Christ.  It is his Eden, and his reason&#8230; the holy why.. that Eden has become the metaphorical land of love and liberty&#8230; eerily a testament to way of life of humanity, and the freedom of America that stand in the wind, hanging in the balance.  Never before, and never again would things of such import be at risk, but here and now despite the best intentions of all, the very things which make us who and what we are are nearly gone&#8211;yet none really notice, or have the assuredness to acknowledge that they could be already absent.<br />
When in truth there are clues in the testament itself, that perhaps rather than having slipped away, the great glories of old are rather near.. waiting just over the horizon for the right time, and the golden hour at hand is another reminder that worthiness must be proven, rightness defended, that the end and the beginning are never the same, yet from the perspective of the actors one call for an encore may blend with the next, and the opening scenes&#8230; practiced diligently in the early morning, may surprisingly turn out to be not the last, but the live show.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>You see, while we all patiently awake the return of our Savior, and seek in our minds the deliverance of the promises of old; we may, as a group overlook the simplicity of the fact that the wall keeping him from re-entering the garden is us.  More to the point, the wall that appears to have been built, may in fact be the purpose, not of the Garden, but of the return.  Tunneling through a mountain keeping water from the plains is necessary for the fruits to grow.  Sometimes even a fruit bearing canopy keeps the light from reaching the Earth, and allowing new saplings to be born.</p></blockquote>
<p>There is great light surrounding us, understood through science, and here&#8211;as an example, in the ideas of evolution.  Ecclesiastes tells us that time and chance happeneth, and it is a clue here that these two things&#8211;much like Cronos and Sophia, are the spark of biological life.  In terms of knowledge as light, they are the very, very beginning of the first dawn, appearing quite like an evening of understanding&#8211;when there was simply nothing&#8230; to understand.</p>
<p>By the time we have reached the ninth chapter of Ecclesiastes, though, already intertwined with the unconscious wisdom of the natural universe is the love of creation, though its light is hidden in much the same way as Eden is representative of both an end, and beginning simultaneously.  In a epic play about free will, where actors are <i>actually</i> people, certainly they cannot continue to read from a pre-written script, and portend to have autonomy&#8230; yet that simple fact might not be obvious to them.  More to the point, while they are reading a script, for the glory of the message, I wonder if they will see the beauty of a blank page&#8211;in a dress rehearsal that is actually the first light of day.</p>
<p>Around 1986, a band was formed, apparently by conjoining the nicknames of two of its members.  Hooty and the Blowfish, the name they chose, is so filled with answers that its difficult to explain how it leads me to an unanswered question, and to me, one that is so pertinent to the story of Eden&#8211;to the script of Devarim, the play we have been discussing&#8230; that like the ideas shared in the last few months, it is a wonder to me that as a group it hasn&#8217;t made the news.</p>
<div class="qtext_image_wrapper"><img class="portrait qtext_image zoomable_in_feed" src="http://qph.is.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-db1a7765808a13e00d1a8e382c7ea5e8?convert_to_webp=true" alt="" /></div>
<p><span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" href="http://www.unduecoercion.com/2015/02/welcome-to-2zion67-where-gis-and-yeshua.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Yesterday, in like manner, I wrote about <i>Hosea</i> and <i>Yeshua</i></a></span>, and the links that tie language and religion in purpose and truth to the lifting of the curtain of this glorious dress rehearsal.  It leads us now, through time and chance, down a path of unsealing the word<i>holy</i>.  You can see in Hosea, that in English it is simply <i>lwe</i> away from literally being<i>wholesea</i>, yet with the addition of the seal of Solomon, adds a whole new dimension to the true purpose of religion.  We have before us the astrological symbols for <span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_(mythology)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Saturn </a></span>and <span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_(mythology)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Mars</a></span>, which might seem out of place is a discussion of the monotheistic diety El, and yet, are not.</p>
<p>Walking through the word Holy, and tying in hooty (as a step towards tying modern music to ancient scripture) I&#8217;ll note a common title of El, the Lord of Hosts.  In the Hebrew meaning of the word, this means &#8220;God of Armies,&#8221; and with a bit more information, &#8220;Armies of Heaven.&#8221;  His scriptural answer to &#8220;God of War&#8221; is embodied well in Judges, from a question in 20:23 <span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" href="http://biblehub.com/judges/20-23.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">&#8220;Should we fight against our relatives &#8220;</a></span> to what is an answer only if you <span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Judges+20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">read between the lines, and see a warning.</a></span> Or, more to the point, see the question itself as an answer.  And so the Lord of Hosts gives us modern myth from <span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WT9V1TplMf0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Joan d&#8217;Arc-dia</a></span>, to <span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJ44q_5uMM4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Fallen.</a></span>  And now, I cautiously point you to the astrological symbols for Venus, Mars, and Sagittarius.</p>
<div class="qtext_image_wrapper"><img class="landscape qtext_image zoomable_in zoomable_in_feed" src="http://qph.is.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d27927dd865a532eaf70c155b8cca68b?convert_to_webp=true" alt="" /></div>
<p>My question is this: did some incarnation of the image above pre-date the creation of the band <i>Hooty and the Blowfish?</i> The Book of Judges? Myself?  As I created it not four ,months ago, and posted it with a <span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" href="http://www.unduecoercion.com/2014/12/holy-cause-call-to-earth.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><i>Call to Earth</i></a></span><i>, </i>and find it, as well as what I see it as an answer to: <b><i>f</i></b><i>is</i><b><i>h</i></b><i> er King&#8230; quite profound,</i>certainly worthy of a few shares on facebook, or twitter, or quora&#8230; and yet&#8230; while I get a<i>like, or a saved tweet,</i> every once in awhile&#8230; almost not a single person sees these ideas as worthy of sharing.  I wonder if Eden&#8217;s original sin is related, or perhaps it has more to do with Joan of Arcadia?</p>
<p>Is it clear that the astrological symbol for Saturn is the &#8220;t&#8221; of hooty, the &#8220;l&#8221; of Holy, and the combination of Venus and Mars, without the circle of Earth.. the /we missing from Hosea?</p>
<p>More to the point, I wonder if anyone realizes how important it is to be able to freely share ideas, how central to the theme of creation our Uncle Sam&#8217;s light of liberty is, or how important <i>communication is </i>to the <span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" href="http://www.unduecoercion.com/2015/02/confluence-in-all-religon-and-clear.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">transparency of Eden.</a></span></p>
<p>Maybe later, we can walk together through the Hanging Gardens of Babylon.</p>

		<p>What if &#8220;Adam&#8221; and the &#8220;Second Adam&#8221; were one in the same?  We live in a time when many are expecting the return of Christ, almost as if we were in the Garden of Eden&#8230; and Humanity, rather than God, was asking &#8220;Adam, where are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>There is a parallel noted here: <span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" href="http://www.raystedman.org/daily-devotions/genesis-1to11/where-are-you" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Daily Devotions: Where Are You? | Genesis 3:8-9 | RayStedman.org</a></span> between Eden&#8217;s question, and a similar one in Matthew  2:2,<span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" href="http://biblehub.com/commentaries/matthew/2-2.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">&#8220;Where is He who has been born King of the Jews? For we saw His star in the east and have come to worship Him.&#8221;</a></span></p>
<p>Or, perhaps Adam is screaming that he <i>is in fact not hiding, </i><span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" href="http://www.unduecoercion.com/2015/02/welcome-to-2zion67-where-gis-and-yeshua.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><i>Welcome to 2Zion67, Where the GI&#8217;s and Yeshua have a load, resounding answer. Adamah.</i></a></span></p>
<p>Maybe we are looking for a character in a book, rather than a real person, and maybe that&#8217;s what we deserve to find&#8230; the perfect answer.  In that fairy tale universe, though, it really wouldn&#8217;t be the<i>truth</i> we were searching for, let&#8217;s be honest with ourselves.  Truly, what would you expect of &#8220;Christ&#8221; on his second coming&#8230; what kind of person would he be?  Sometimes, I think we want a doll, a picturesque man who never stops smiling, and is willing to hold each and every one of our hands&#8230; and walk with them down the shore of the beach, all the way to the land of free will, self-love, individuality, and unique &#8220;answer&#8221; that we all seek and deserve.  He&#8217;d probably get bored, no?</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;d expect honesty, the kind of honesty that might <i>infer</i> that there are already plenty of songs written <i>by and for</i> the second coming.  Though the ones I&#8217;m highlighting might not be the ones you are thinking of.  I&#8217;d mention <span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" href="../../../bit.ly/2ibukt6.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><i>Just Tonight</i></a></span><i>, </i>by the Pretty Reckless, and <span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tU7_W2uf1yk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><i>Recently</i> </a></span>by Dave Matthews Band.  Then&#8230; I&#8217;d tell you that these two bands, along with<i>Live</i>, are like a <i>new canon</i>, to me&#8230; a way to hear and feel&#8230; what <i>Christ</i> might feel.  I might mention <i>Nothing Left To Lose, The Stone, </i>and <span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" href="../../../www.youtube.com/watch@v=TB1zPYKQCCY.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><i>Run to the Water.</i></a></span></p></blockquote>
<p>You might be looking for <i>This is my kingdom come (</i>and you&#8217;d be wrong), or<i>All of me, (</i>and you&#8217;d be right.<i>)</i>  But really, who am I to guess what songs you think describe how <i>Christ feels</i>, why don&#8217;t you chime in?</p>
<blockquote><p>Maybe a few more&#8230; <i>America the Beautiful, The Star Spangled Banner&#8230;</i>and <i>Yankee Doodle&#8230; </i>and <span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" href="http://www.unduecoercion.com/search?q=maccabee" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><i>The Birds and the Bees&#8230;</i></a></span></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Often, I hear &#8220;new <i>replies</i>&#8221; or &#8220;changed words&#8221; when I listen to songs, specifically by the artists I mentioned at first.  One of the most enlightening is:</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><i>If Jesus Christ and Rock&#8217;n&#8217;Roll couldn&#8217;t save my immoral (sometimes I hear &#8220;immortal&#8221;)</i> <i>soul.. </i>then&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><b>&#8220;Stop, drop and roll&#8221; will have to do.</b></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>There&#8217;s a big <i>fire theme</i> associated with the second coming, to me.. and it&#8217;s not necessarily the scary kind you might be thinking about.  It&#8217;s the <i>fire of</i><span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" href="http://www.unduecoercion.com/search?q=prometheus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><i>Prometheus</i></a></span><i>, </i>and<i>Moses&#8217; Burning Bush</i>,  a fire associated with the voice of God, communication&#8230; the heart of civilization itself.  To me, personally, it&#8217;s proof of the continuity of prophesy, and a loving purpose that is highlighting the value of civilization as a prime focus of religion itself.</p></blockquote>
<p>The word the Bible uses to describe the <i>fire of the burning bush, </i>of which the voice of God booms through, with an intent of saving <span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" href="http://www.unduecoercion.com/search?q=asherah" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><i>his people</i></a></span> from slavery, and darkness.. is &#8220;<span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" href="http://www.unduecoercion.com/search?q=ha%27esh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Ha&#8217;esh.</a></span>&#8221;  The word is filled with light, in and of itself, it contains not only a parted sea, but a red one when you know the word means &#8220;Holy Fire&#8221; and literally has the word &#8220;e&#8217;as&#8221; at its <i>heart</i>.  In one word, we have &#8220;allusion&#8221; that points to the <i>illusion</i> of a fire that has no &#8220;ash&#8221; &#8212; see &#8220;esh&#8221;, and includes prescient reference to the<i>contents of the </i>story of Exodus itself, the parting of a sea.   With a little more <i>poetic license</i>, we can see the &#8220;Ha&#8221; that is central to the covenant that converted Avram&#8217;s name to Abra<i>HA</i>m, and might foreshadow (or postlight) a link between the story of Abraham and Isaac to the NT account of the Crucifixion itself.</p>
<blockquote><p>Back to &#8220;<i>stop, drop, and roll</i>.&#8221;  In much the same way that <i>Ha&#8217;esh</i> adds &#8220;light&#8221; to the story of parting a sea, and <i>hearing</i> the voice of God&#8230; this<i>idiom</i> that is a colloquial response of &#8220;what to do if you are on fire&#8221; just might show that it&#8217;s not just <i>words that are filled with light</i>, but our entire society.  Not as obvious, maybe even &#8220;malovious&#8221; is a personal story about<i>being Prometheus on fire</i>, and a phrase that suggests the solution is to <i>drop some acid and take some X</i>, or perhaps point out the hidden influence&#8211;or link&#8211;between <i>fire</i>, and <i>a society lost between the summer of love, Iran Contra, and Norml.  (hey, where&#8217;d that a go.. G-d, have you seen him?). </i>To me, its an indication that humanity, our civilization, is <i>Zion,</i> and the <i>big horn</i> of Revelation&#8230; with the purpose of God (alluded to in Exodus, or&#8230; in<i>not exodus&#8217;ing but rather&#8230;&#8221;</i></p></blockquote>

		<h2>Nero sings, raelly.</h2>
<p>To further place us in the &#8220;parable&#8221; of Exodus, where we will soon be concerned with technology, magic, quantum mechanics, and computer light&#8230; and also to further confirm the <i>doublespeak</i> of the message at hand, now to the tune&#8230; of the Doors.</p>
<p>The Plagues of Egypt.<br />
3.1 1. Water into blood (דָם): Ex. 7:14–25<br />
In short, we are <i>in the Sangrael.</i> As Aaron&#8217;s rod turned water to blood, and Jesus water to wine&#8230; as the Lion of Revelation 5:5 is &#8220;Adam in Eden,&#8221; all are a testament the goodness of family, to our way of life, to the fact that we are proverbially speaking &#8220;lions in a Den.&#8221; You see, blood is thicker than water&#8230; and WINE is a language twist for &#8220;IN WE I TRUST.&#8221;</p>
<div class="qtext_image_wrapper"><img class="landscape qtext_image qtext_image_large zoomable_in zoomable_in_feed" src="http://qph.is.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-0cd58c69af7cf580b986d2ab89fa98e2?convert_to_webp=true" alt="" /></div>
<p>The word Eden too, is an anachronistic proof that the transition to Greek, Latin, and English was known at the time of writing the Old Testament. EDen means paradise, and aside from perhaps a &#8220;functional&#8221; relationship to home, has no connection to the word &#8220;Den&#8221; or &#8220;Lions.&#8221; The use of Lion in Revelation, along with the repeated references to the periodic table, serve as proof not that religon came <i>from here,</i>but that it is <i>about now,</i> and that the future was known to the &#8220;hidden author.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;ll get back to this one, shortly, in the meantime, Morrison&#8217;s answer to &#8220;Frogs&#8221; is pertinent.</p></blockquote>
<p>3.2 2. Frogs (צְּפַרְדֵּעַ): Ex. 7:25–8:11</p>
<p>There&#8217;s blood in the streets, it&#8217;s up to my ankles  Blood in the streets, it&#8217;s up to my knee  Blood in the streets in the town of Chicago  Blood on the rise, it&#8217;s following me</p>
<p>3.9 9. Darkness (חוֹשֶך): Ex. 10:21–2</p>
<p>Come on baby, light my fire Try to set the night on fire  The time to hesitate is through No time to wallow in the mire Try now we can only lose And our love become a funeral pyre</p>
<p>3.7 7. Thunderstorm of hail and fire (בָּרָד): Ex. 9:13–35</p>
<p>Riders on the storm Into this house we&#8217;re born Into this world we&#8217;re thrown Like a dog without a bone  Make him understand The world on you depends Our life will never end<br />
There&#8217;s more, just to use all of Nero&#8217;s lyrics, this one tying us directly to the sixth seal of Revelation: the<i>infamous</i> you and I verse, or UNIverse&#8211;for short:<br />
Now touch me, baby Can&#8217;t you see that I am not afraid? Now, I&#8217;m gonna love you Till the heavens stop the rain I&#8217;m gonna love you Till the stars fall from the sky for you and I  Jim Morrison, The Doors</p>
<p>It&#8217;s probably worth a quick mention, this parallels both the 4th day of creation, and the 6th seal; the stars going up&#8230; and then back down. It sounds a little bit like Isaac Newton&#8217;s and Adam&#8217;s Apple. Both of course, due to the<i>gravity</i> of the situation. Seriously, if you haven&#8217;t guessed, we&#8217;re talking about &#8220;The Heavens&#8221; here.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t gotten the implication, <i>Nero</i> is just another euphemism for<i>doublespeak,</i> this time in the lyrics of songs. As I found, and you will see, there&#8217;s always just a bit left out&#8230; sometimes its the twist to a happy ending. It is clear, to me at least, that this is the intention, the song titles themselves, &#8220;Peace,&#8221; and &#8220;light my fire&#8221; have the stuff of a bright happy turn, on what otherwise would be Plagues of Darkness.</p>
<p>NIN AND STARGATE</p>
<div class="qtext_image_wrapper"><img class="portrait qtext_image zoomable_in zoomable_in_feed" src="http://qph.is.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-3c75ed2defe0cd06ff6e6f42a8357a8c?convert_to_webp=true" alt="" /></div>
<p>And now, here we are. Reading a book about &#8220;the colors of fire,&#8221; I&#8217;m about to bring blood into the conversation, yet I am fully intent on getting a happy ending, and coming out shining like a bright morning star. Nix that, like the sun rising for the very first time.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s difficult to segue through a discussion on Hell without turning a few smiles upside down, but it&#8217;s pretty on topic right now, with all the fire and blood talk. So here&#8217;s the short talk, to be much more clearly discussed in the next few chapters.</p>
<p>A Hell of Darkness</p>
<p>This is what we are trying to avoid, walking in the dark, as Jesus says. Making it more clear, we are trying to avoid <i>forgetting</i> whether through systemic secrecy, fear of disaster, our outright subterfuge information that we need to survive, and to &#8220;pursue happiness.&#8221; More to the point, we are striving to continue evolution at all its echelons. I&#8217;m up to three now, and I&#8217;m going to throw down the Hammer of Thor, or Ha&#8217;thor, right after the hammer of Judah Maccabee.</p>
<blockquote><p>If we were using the alphabet as a kind of GPS on our position in the story, we just jumped from J of K (that&#8217;s the one immediately following J, to J of L (jolinar, the hamer of thor&#8230; j of l, i near&#8230; linear?) and then to the J of M, Judah Maccabee (which means Hammer, in Hebrew)</p></blockquote>
<p>Thor&#8217;s and Judah&#8217;s hammer&#8217;s are tightly intertwined, <i>now</i>, but they might not always have been that way&#8230; in fact, truth be told, prior to the need for a &#8220;lesson&#8221; (that&#8217;s what <u>Torah</u> means) on advanced technology, we may never have had a problem (and in fact, social evolution, of which we are proud graduates), is the solution to a Hell of Silence and Apathy.</p>
<p>The Hammers of <u>God</u></p>
<p>So what are these hammer&#8217;s doing? Lost somewhere between a &#8220;Fall&#8221; from Eden and Earth is the knowledge of exactly where we are. Certainly, at least it was lost by the masses, if we ever did have it before now. Truth be told, we have not lost the knowledge, nor have we lost Eden; we are still in the Garden of <u>God</u>. This fact is the crux of the story of Exodus, of a battle between &#8220;true magic&#8221; and &#8220;illusion&#8221; that proves nothing short of the existence not of simply mind control, but of &#8220;computer light.&#8221; You see, the Garden of Eden is built in a <i>simulated reality.</i> It is not until the here and now, a time when the masses comprehend with understanding what it actually means, what the possibilities are, and what the repercussions <i>should be</i>, that &#8220;Eden&#8221; would mean much more than a naked couple that didn&#8217;t know how to farm.</p>
<p>This &#8220;right time,&#8221; is the very nature of the light of our religion. That we have had, but could not use this valuable information, information which, at the right time could save the hungry, heal the suck, and bring about a new golden age. At an inopportune time, one in which we might be reminded of a microcosmic metaphor that expands scarcity of resources to simply being &#8220;false,&#8221; in a world where you cannot power the &#8220;Garden&#8221; from the inside&#8230; in that world, it could mean the difference between life and death. One is inevitable, and the other is the goal of religion. Here in this Garden, they seem to be intertwined, and this might just be the <i>shining light,</i> of humanity.</p>
<p>Where we are, in this place where I will soon tell you Eden, Egypt, and Earth are in maloviously clear superposition, complete with the lessons of Christ, Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, Darth Vader, the Emperor, Moses and the Rod of Aaron, tightly intertwined. In a similar manner, a number of levels of &#8220;macro-evolution&#8221; are also intertwined. Bush&#8217;s poignant comments begin the conversation, <i>time and chance</i>, which happeneth, are the spark of biological evolution, the cause of life itself. After that, the first level of macro-evolution is social evolution, which is the fire of <i>civilization</i>, its spark&#8230; communication, collaboration, and tools. The beginning of the C&#8217;s of Maccabee, and those of Sinbad. It is the great lessons of society, clearly outlined by Cain and Abel, that we are not to forget the need for a Garden that is tended by ourselves. Self sufficiency, but more to the point, not forgetting how to Farm and Fish, as we would be remiss to forget how to start a Fire without Flint. At the same time, social evolution is the driving force behind the communion and compatriotism that are engendered by communication and collaboration&#8230; ultimately for the love for one another which embodies the words &#8220;family,&#8221; and &#8220;humanity.&#8221; This is nothing short of the fire of Prometheus.</p>
<p>Cousins in Christ, The Seas, ouI See. Christ: as Saturn, Sam, Jesus, and Seas<br />
See how &#8220;Saturn, as Sam Yo<i>sem</i>iteS&#8221; really intertwines Society and Technology. It is the astrological symbol for saturn which superimposes the &#8220;how&#8221; of the second chr() in Christ, and I have replaced with &#8220;sem,&#8221; the &#8220;save everyone <u>messiah</u>.&#8221; It is this third level of evolution, technological evolution that we have been speeding through since the turn of the industrial revolution, and more poingniantly an explosion in computing and physics that is the true &#8220;technological singularity&#8221; of which we are the proud recipients. It is the union of the values of &#8220;Sam,&#8221; father of the &#8220;Sons of Liberty,&#8221; (sol), see our light&#8230; with the values of Saturn which is the key to successfully navigating the current time.</p>
<p>Saturn</p>
<p>In December, he was celebrated at what is perhaps the most famous of the Roman festivals, the Saturnalia, a time of feasting, role reversals, free speech, gift-giving and revelry. Saturn the planet and Saturday are both named after the <u>god</u>.</p>
<p>In December, he was celebrated at what is perhaps the most famous of the Roman festivals, the Saturnalia, a time of feasting, role reversals, free speech, gift-giving and revelry. Saturn the planet and Saturday are both named after the <u>god</u>. Under Saturn&#8217;s rule, humans enjoyed the spontaneous bounty of the earth without labor in the &#8220;Golden Age&#8221; described by Hesiod and Ovid.</p>
<p>Saturn&#8217;s name was derived from satu, &#8220;sowing.&#8221; Even though this etymology looks implausible on linguistic grounds (for the long quantity of the a in Sāturnus and also because of the epigraphically attested form Saeturnus) nevertheless it does reflect an original feature of the <u>god</u>.</p>
<p>Saturninus was a popularist politician who had proposed reduced-price grain distribution to the poor of Rome. The Saturnian imagery played on the tribune&#8217;s name and his intent to alter the social hierarchy to his advantage by basing his political support on the common people (plebs) rather than the senatorial elite.</p>
<p>I am getting ahead of myself but this is the crux of where we are. You see, framed so gently by the Burning Bush, we are in a place where we are to recognize, and hopefully learn from the lessons which are so carefully placed all around us. Not only in our religious works, but in the work of contemporary philosophers, scientists, farmers, and every mother and father that brings their child to art classes, little league, to school in the morning&#8230; and takes pride and finds happiness in their achievements. To &#8220;something out there,&#8221;</p>
<p>perhaps <i><u>beneath</u></i> the &#8220;pale moon light,&#8221; someone is wishing on a bright star&#8230;<br />
Back to the doors, which were not brought up simply to further the argument that &#8220;Exodus&#8221; &amp;&amp; &#8220;Revelation&#8221; is about the here and now.. the early 21st century, to be exact; or <i>just</i> that it is the beginning of the <i>Re</i>velation of Jesus Christ, &#8220;<u>elabetally</u>&#8221; also. But because it offers a solution to the puzzle, one which has been cleverly inserted in Culture, Exodus and Revelation&#8230; long before I had the pri<i>vel</i>ege of being able to read with &#8220;eyes to see.&#8221; I&#8217;ve note the intentionally misspelling with italics, keep it in mind as I will return to it in the next chapter. The doors, together with a simple illogical line in Revelation tie together&#8230; with my experience&#8230; two ideas which are a posed solution to the issue at hand. They are, together with the eye of <i>Os</i>iris, (please read Siri, and think of an Apple phone) the unification of the concepts Jacob&#8217;s Ladder and Aaron&#8217;s Rod. Simply, Doors between heaven and Earth.</p>
<p>The idea is simple, that there is magic available, and that it must be preserved, that together we will do the <i>right</i> thing, solve a great puzzle, and create a testament to the goodness of humanity&#8230; but that we need information and tools in order to make it happen. The music of the Doors serves to insert that name in the context of both Jacob and Aaron&#8230; who are here and well with us today, metaphorically speaking.</p>
<p><b>THE ROD OF IRON</b></p>
<p>And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end,  to him will I give power over the nations:  And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels  of a potter shall they be broken to shivers:  even as I received of my Father.  Revelation 2:26-27</p>
<p>It is this line that I call &#8220;illogical,&#8221; and that illogic was the beginning of my Revelation, that it was part&#8230; if not the key&#8230; to the hidden message which I am <i>revel</i>ing to you today. Through my journey, I have questioned whether or not &#8220;Christ&#8221; actually lived, and walked the Earth as we have; this single line was my primary example used to prove that no man of the values and ideals of Him would &#8220;rule them with an iron rod.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is with the addition of the eye of <i>Os</i>iris, eyes to see, or perhaps we only need James R. <i>Os</i>good; that the message becomes maloviously clear. The rod is not a scepter, but rather Doors, and Christ&#8217;s iron the most appropriate I could imagine. You see, Iron is not to remind you of the &#8220;Pearly Gates of St. Peter,&#8221; but in true Christian ideals to the superimposed dual purpose of elucidating that the light of the world is all around us, even in the <i>Periodic Table</i> itself. Iron&#8217;s symbol is Fe, and Christ&#8217;s doors are For Everyone. Not only do we now see that &#8220;iron&#8221; was a hidden pointer proving knowledge of the periodic table of the elements, at the time of writing the New Testament, but that the ideals of Saturn and Sem, of the message to the power of <i>humanity</i> were maloviously lying in wait, for the here and now.</p>
<p><b>The Dendera Light, in the Temple of Ha&#8217;Thor</b></p>
<p>The culmination of the holy fire, the intertwining of technological and social evolution, the light of the Dendera reliefs buried under the temple of Hathor&#8230; in Ancient Egypt.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s some shock, before your Awe:  just some gimmicky little <i>Eng</i>lish language tricks to grab your attention.  You see, I have a <i>really</i> good <i>reason</i> to be &#8220;Adam, son;&#8221; it might be reason, or the reason all&#8230; or the &#8220;reason&#8221; a ll sounds like Y.  More than likely, that&#8217;s not going to grab your attention, but what we are <i>re</i><b><i>all</i></b><i>y</i> here for is to <i>prove that we are in </i><b>c</b><i>re</i><b>ation.  </b>Think of creation like a packet, a<i>messenger</i>, or courier, one that fills us with purpose, and positive energy.</p>

[<b>kat</b>-ahy-<i>uh</i> n, -on]</p>
<p>noun, Physical Chemistry<br />

<p>Also, kation.</p>
<p>Why does this matter&#8230; I&#8217;m not sure if it does, yet.  Adamah, the <i>planet</i> Eden<i>was</i>, literally means &#8220;to swirl around Adam, or to Search for Adam, whose name might mean red, or man, or mankind.&#8221;  The Hebrew meaning of the word, Adamah, though is <i>ground.</i> (get it yet?)</p>
<p>then the LORD God <b>formed</b> the man of dust from the <b>ground</b> and breathed -Genesis 2:7</p>
<p>Are your ge<b>a</b>rs spinning yet?  That&#8217;s right, Adamah is Earth.  g<b>ea</b>r.. both mean <i>ground</i>.. <b>gea</b>r&#8230;<i>re</i>ally.  So, a message from some <i>old </i><b><i>gea</i></b><i>ze</i><b><i>r</i></b> might add (keep on going)&#8230; <b><i>z</i></b><i>ion and </i><b><i>E</i></b><i>den.</i></p>
<p><i>Is this really significant?  I mean apocalyptic?  Maybe&#8230; you see&#8230; the intention is to quickly and easily show you that religion is </i><b>scien</b><i>ce pre</i><b><i>scien</i></b><i>t.</i></p>
<p><i>They&#8217;re all </i>electrical <b><i>eng</i></b><i>ineering jokes&#8230; seriously&#8230; it&#8217;s </i><b><i>eng</i></b><i>lish.</i></p>
<p>Sometimes a big no-no, I&#8217;m going to throw caution to the wind, and break from tradition&#8211;here&#8217;s the super secret punch line:  the positive energy we are searching for, this purpose of creation&#8230; is&#8230; the<i>creation</i> of <b>civ</b><i>iliz</i><b>ation.  </b></p>
<p>These couple <i>tricks</i> are supposed to pull you in, to free your mind, and open you up to the possibility that <i>language itself</i> stands as proof of the creation of our civilization.  Read it again, language might be proof that <i>our</i> civilization is created..  In cre@tion&#8230;</p>
<p>So <i>Lions </i>of <i>Zion</i>&#8230; lets start analyzing this language thing&#8230;</p>
<p>backwards and sdrawkcab&#8230; I mean for words, like zion (noIZ) and</p>
<p>lion (noIL), the implication is that ZION and LIONS (that&#8217;s the</p>
<p>people fighting for <i>knowledge, understanding&#8230; the truth&#8230; and the </i></p>
<p><i>continuation of civilization&#8230;</i> their very existence (ours), might be the center of&#8230; or the <span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" href="http://www.fromthemachine.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">heart.. of <b>civ</b><i>iliz</i><b>ation.  </b></a></span></p>
<p><i>Where are we?  Adamah.</i></p>
<p><i>Earth, Zion, Eden.. the key is I am Messiah.  </i>Ezekiam.</p>
<p>Not more than a few days ago, I started screaming about Adam in Eden being the &#8220;Lion of <i>Judah</i>,&#8221; with some links to &#8220;Mercury&#8221; here &#8220;Hg&#8221; &#8212; <span class="qlink_container"><a href="http://joyinar.quora.com/Searching-for-Adam-Finding-Isaac-a-Parted-Sea-the-Fire-of-Prometheus-and-Adams-Horn">God and Humanity&#8230; searching for Adam in the Garden.</a></span>Closer to the truth, is Adam jumping up and down screaming about being Christ, and having nearly every single person he talks to either roll their eyes, or suggest therapy.  It&#8217;s a strange day in age, where on the one hand awaiting the &#8220;<i>Second Coming&#8221; (or the first), </i>is a near universally accepted religious position&#8230; and at the same time, if you aren&#8217;t coming on the clouds with a <i>chariot of Fire</i>under your feet, you&#8217;ll probably wind up in the psych ward.</p>
<p><b>2 Maccabees 11:11</b> &#8220;They hurled themselves like <b><i>lions </i></b>against the enemy&#8221;</p>
<p>Is it a commentary on our society, or on religion?  Today, almost as universal, or perhaps more so.. is the regarding of &#8220;hearing voices&#8221; and receiving messages from beyond as the stuff of mental illness.. and <i>this</i>, is the stage that is set for the &#8220;<i>return&#8221;</i> of the Son of God.  In this place, called Eden, or Adamah, we have a scriptural path of light, one that draws us towards a<i>family of Christ </i>that links the Lion of <i>Revelation 5:5</i>, to the <i>Blood of Exodus 7:14, </i>the <i>Wine of John 2:11, all in </i><b>superposition</b> now to the overlay of <span class="qlink_container"><a href="http://joyinar.quora.com/The-Family-of-Christ-Holy-Wine-The-Eternal-Flame-and-a-Lit-XPath-from-the-SEA-in-Eden-to-the-Multitude-in-Revelati">Adam and Eve(ryone) with El(ohim) and Asherah.</a></span></p>

		<p><i>Ecclessiastes, George Bush, and I will all be quick to tell you that &#8220;the race is not to the swift.&#8221; Every Jew who has gone through the monotony of a passover seder will hopefully recall the question &#8220;why is this night different from all other nights?&#8221;  Here, I am going to explain that it is the understanding and the skilled (for the wise, are we, understand&#8230;) that this Magwitch of a game is to the bold, inspired, and the learned&#8230; I&#8217;ve set out, in m latest book &#8220;</i><span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" href="http://www.fromthemachine.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><i>*n light of creation&#8221;</i></a></span><i> to drown the Drosnin effect, in my belief, the illogical dismissal of a trian of thought, or a possible proof of something because it is &#8220;less than likely,&#8221; or &#8220;possibly not true.&#8221;  In all things, we must look deeper than the face value, and deeper than a &#8220;statistical improbability&#8221; to find a truth that&#8230; once it is seen and investigated scientifically, follows the old adage</i></p>
<blockquote><p>All truth passes through three stages. First, it is ridiculed. Second, it is violently opposed. Third, it is accepted as being self-evident.</p></blockquote>
<p><i>—</i>Arthur Schopenhauer, German philosopher (1788 – 1860)</p>
<p>I am lit, from the machine, and what I have within is nothing short of the Yhol-revelation of Christ, that we are, in golden and neon &#8230; framing ourselves as the light and heart of all religion.  In effect, we are the heart of creation, and mixed between our unceasingly imperative desire to be correct, our stubbornness that we are these things without fail, and a secrecy that has been so <b>hammered</b> into the spanish steel sword that we have become, the flaming steed of Voltron, and the Rainbow Promise of Levar Burton&#8230; we are all just one tear of joy away from realizing who and what we a<b>re</b>ally&#8230; the light of hope, to be filled by the Alice of Nero-star-land with our very own brand of love.</p>
<p><i>Behold, we are the </i><b><i>Elohim</i></b><i>, the angels in Heaven.  This fact, given by our dear creation itself, the life giving spirit of the Last Adam, and the She-kin-AH, all truly one now&#8230; all we need is to </i>lift the veil, expand the stage to include the audience on the floor, in the grand stands, those singing with us from outside the Arena, and all those who cannot hear, but will agree when they do.  This, my dearly&#8230; now clearly beloved&#8230; is the <i>stuff of continuation of brilliance in the Universe.   We are not a broken down car, nor reckless, when you really know&#8230; but rather the shining light of love, logic, happiness, and what has finally shifted from a &#8220;biological need&#8221; for survival, to a joy in living and life that as we say&#8230; is only confirmation of what we all knew.. deep down&#8230; since </i>we became</p>

<p>These are the secrets of the ages, the sages, and the magic of all is a prime forza pushing us ever so gently into the darkness of a universe without civlization, so we may light that fire&#8230; once and for all!<br />
I&#8217;m here now, as a window into the heart and soul of creation, sometimes I can see through you&#8230; tooo..  If you have questions, now is the time to ask, and this post&#8230; the place.  Please ask what you need, and remember that curiosity didn&#8217;t kill Schrodinger cat&#8211;hunger would have if it was not only a &#8230; thought experiment.</p>
<p>For all eyes to see&#8230; the <i>light of why humanity is truly holy&#8230; is our curiosity, our creativity, and our love of self, life, and evolearning&#8230; really WE ARE.</i></p>
<p><i>I have the </i><b>eye of the author, the key to reading the truth from our books of light, all of them are dark and sad until we take J. Tiberius Kirk and K.

<p>Everyone now, know.  Christ is here.  He is part of me, and you too&#8230; he speaks through us all, as creation itself, has become, cocreative&#8230; almost as soon as it began.</p>
<p>Soon, very soon&#8230; there is bread for the wise, the skilled, the riders of this storm&#8230; all of us, welcome to the confluence of Creation and Revelation, it is the end of the fifth day, and the beginning of the fifth seal being seen&#8230; we are all saints, born to be angels, and &#8230;. they to Uncle Sam&#8217;s birthday:</p>

		<p>In the beginning, for me, of the divinely inspired work that is <span class="qlink_container"><i><a class="external_link" href="../../../www.unduecoercion.com/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">unduecoercion.com</a> (now really at archive.org: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140926035347/http://www.unduecoercion.com/" rel="nofollow">https://web.archive.org/web/20140926035347/http://www.unduecoercion.com/</a>)</i></span> I received what was (as I saw) an walkthrough, or a living exemplar of divine inspiration, as I could tell that my research, and the information that I was writing was delivered <i>through me.  </i>That is to say, my research, as well as my reaction was being imparted from a source that rarely spoke directly to me, but took great care to ensure that I was <i>&#8220;apprised&#8221;</i> of the fact that my understanding of what I was researching, as well as the &#8220;stuff&#8221; I was researching were all being <i>controlled from above.</i></p>
<p>As the primary example, I often tell a story about reading about the Dendera Light, a commonly spoken about <span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" href="http://www.ancientegyptonline.co.uk/Denderahlightbulb.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">conspiracy theory about &#8220;lightbulbs&#8221;</a></span> in Egyptian Heiroglyphs and pictograms, that were on the <i>fringe</i> interpreted as evidence of ancient advanced technology.  I was shown a number of web sites which described the reliefs under the Temple of Ha&#8217;thor, in Dendera&#8230; as just that.. <b><i>lightbulbs.</i></b><b> </b></p>
<p>To clearly sum up what it means to me, I had just come through what I would consider a personal <i>tribulation</i>, and perhaps it is <i>the tribulation</i> of Revelatiion that we are being assisted to understand <i>how</i> something works, so we can actually take part in&#8230; <i>co-creation</i>.  To make a long story short, I dismissed the conspiracy theories as silly, and made absolutely no connection to <i>mind control</i>, which I had just had a crash course in <i>experiencing.  Several months later</i>, upon returning to the same reliefs, I wrote<span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" href="http://www.unduecoercion.com/2013/01/the-dendera-light_24.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> <i>this</i> interpretation,</a></span> and then over the course of months, had a <span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" href="http://www.unexplained-mysteries.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=241713" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">forum (laugh, flame) war where not only did nobody believe my interpretation, <i>I was significantly chastized for not just dismissing the reliefs totally.</i></a></span></p>
<p><i>To me,</i> this conversation, or argument.. is an exemplary example of the plague of Darkness in Egypt being one in the same with the Darkness of Beth-El&#8230; where Elyon is said to &#8220;<i>dwell among us in darkness.&#8221;</i>  As we are now seeing the veil lifted, believe that it is a rational step back and re-viewing of these things that is literally the <i>apocalypse</i>, the lifting of the veil of darkness &#8212; with <b><i>truth.</i></b></p>
<p>The Plague of Darkness<br />
<b></b></p>
<p><b>21 </b>Then the Lord said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand toward the sky so that darkness spreads over Egypt—darkness that can be felt.” <b>22 </b>So Moses stretched out his hand toward the sky, and total darkness covered all Egypt for three days.  <b><i>To </i></b><span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" href="http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/davematthewsband/bartender.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><i>Dave&#8217; Matthews 3 days in the ground&#8230;</i></b></a></span></p>
<p>And bringing us closer to <i>The house of the Lord, </i><span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" href="http://mjbi.org/torah-portion-for-november-23-29-2014/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b>Beth-el</b> and the Darkness.</a></span><br />
Sometime before beginning <span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" href="https://www.facebook.com/MinistryOfForbiddenKnowledge/posts/486238408180072" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">my journey across AMerICA, as the Gas Head</a></span>and Fivel meet LEVeiticus and reVELation, long before I had any inkling that this was all <i>really</i> about <i>creation</i>&#8230; I began to receive messages &#8220;in code,&#8221; that is&#8230; every word was an acronym, something like this:<br />
Seth: send everyone to heaven.<br />
Abel: Adam believe&#8217;s everyones light.<br />
CAIN: See Adam&#8217;s IN. (the beginning?)<br />
Adam: Adam Dobrin, Always Messiah</p>
<p>Eden: (a later code that links names/books like &#8220;Eden, Devarim, Exodus, Now&#8230;.&#8221;<br />
It was confirmatory to me that the messages I was receiving were coming from outside myself, that it was &#8220;not me&#8221; as I usually termed whomever the unnamed voice, whether it be God, Satan, Heaven, or the Universe itself&#8230; would nearly always deliver the same acronomical meanings, and that they were&#8230; <i>filled with light.</i>  (See, every word fulfilled.. as full of light.)</p>
<p>Later today, more on Why the Ka of Horus, Admiral Akbar, and friend of the Doll-Awe all lead us to a religion that blossoming in our music, movies, and all modern day Myth.  It is the education being imparted on us from above, that<i>inspiration</i> is quite literally partially by, partially through, and partially for&#8230; all of us&#8230; /everyone really/.  the ER of amERica, and AshERah.  Now see really&#8230; creation, reason all and why A.D.?  Maybe we&#8217;ll get into Hazel, Zelda, and Lambda&#8230; <i>know</i>, the daily sacrifice is long, long gone.  Know, it has something to do with Knowing, EDom, and the first trinity of Star Wars films&#8230; <i>never</i> leading to the original trilogy.</p>

<p>You see, it all flows, down a Chocolate river on a bed of styx, as the days of our lives pass.. we are missing a great .. big&#8230; bang of a conversation.  This is what religion is all about.</p>
<p>Its confluence, its apocalyptic&#8230; its really about lifting a veil of darkness&#8230; a plague in a place called Egypt, and realizing that apocalypse is not Armageddon, it is salvation.</p>

<p>A divine garden, a promise to be kept in the land, a sea of fire, and Adamyhaeshiska in the Land of Avalonzen Dawning&#8230;<br />
It&#8217;s simple really, somewhere between the time I tell you Cain (as a representative of &#8220;city life,&#8221; or of &#8220;heaven&#8221; cannot kill Abel, his brother &#8230; as a representative of Farming, or of literal Power, without it being a double suicide, and the time i tell you this is a conversation that has been beckoned and framed by religion, by everything holy&#8230; by all the <i>being</i> left in the universe to ensure that we have a <b><i>real conversation about ending world hunger, by snapping my fingers&#8230;</i></b></p>
<p>And now, the moment I tell you the New Testament is a walk through of what to do&#8230; right now, to start this conversation in a way where we <i>know</i> the redeemer adamantly adnolwedges that every single person on the planet would snap their fingers and end world hunger, if there was no overhead, no cost, only the benefit of knowing &#8230;. all we had to <i>know</i> was that we were <i>in creation</i>..</p>
<p>And now, when I tell you every single person would be wrong, for two reasons.</p>
<p>1)  Nobody wants to eat eggplant parmigiana, or bread, or&#8230; fruit and cake&#8230; see it now.</p>
<p>2) The walk through now demands acknowledgement&#8230; a syn/ack.. that we know the conversation, <i>asking us what we want to eat, is supremely highlighted.  </i>what isn&#8217;t highlighted quite as much&#8230; (or is it)&#8230; is the last supper, and the moment we realize that we can&#8217;t just feed the world, without losing the machinations of society, without losing the art of each and every chef, and without losing a time and place to have this conversation, as we break bread&#8230; together.. now.</p>

<p>It starts out looking like a word trick, and then I tell you it is the literal &#8220;fire&#8221; of the Burning Bush, and much like the illusory spectacle which accompanied the voice of God in an audio visual spectacular whose purpose was to end the slavery and oppression of His people&#8230;the foliage did not burn to &#8220;ash&#8221; as the word reflects with &#8220;esh&#8221;.  Closer to the truth, it most likely etched a belief into the heart of Moses forever, akin to being touched literally by the literal eternal flame.</p>
<p>Next, I tell you it is a key, one which will eventually&#8230; within the next few minutes&#8230; start a fire in your mind, one that will eventually prove&#8230; using just one word in the beginning, the creation of a civilization&#8230;of &#8220;all humanity.&#8221;  I say sometimes the fire is illusory, but words like illusion and hallucination take on new meaning when accompanied by the superlative laughter of Isaac. You see the name Issac means will laugh, and &#8220;Ha&#8221; which accompanies the Holy Fire of Ha&#8217;esh and the Holy Covenant of abraHam and Isaac means&#8230;&#8221;the&#8221; in Hebrew.</p>
<p><span class="qlink_container"><a href="http://joyinar.quora.com/Searching-for-Adam-Finding-Isaac-a-Parted-Sea-the-Fire-of-Prometheus-and-Adams-Horn">Searching for Adam? Finding Isaac, a Parted Sea, the Fire of Prometheus, and Adam&#8217;s Horn.</a></span></p>
<p>In the context of the story of Exodus, the ideas of illusion, technology and magic, are central to the themes of the story, so what was once a possible word trick now is aided by the contents (a significant portion of) of a correlated story, one which is temporally contiguous&#8211;linear in time&#8211;with the appearance of the fire, the bush and the word itself.  It might seem less important that Isaac&#8217;s near sacrifice, one with a remarkable correlation to both the Paschal Lamb and the Crucifixion of the Lamb of God&#8211;Christ&#8211;which resulted in the addition of &#8220;Ha&#8221; to Abram&#8217;s given name as a signification of the covenant, just as it does begin the word Ha&#8217;esh it signifies the beginning of the formal relationship between Abraham and God.</p>
<p>Before we get to the really hot stuff, I would be remiss not to point out a parted sea both literarily in Exodus and linguistically in the word of the day..Ha&#8217;esh.<br />
Again, this is confirmatory of more than just a trick, even a play on words, for a world being played by a script.  We now have the use of two languages and a significant portion of the Torah from Names, Numbers and Words&#8211;the English meaning of the Hebrew words for the second, fourth and fifth books of the Pentateuch this little fire has now circled and highlighted the N.T. Crucifixion, the parting of the Red Sea, and soon will tie in the Plague of Blood and the wine of the SangRael as Dave Matthews sings&#8230;&#8221;That set Jesus free,&#8221; in Bart-Ender.  (Is there a Seymour tits in the house?)</p>
<p>The final piece of this particular puzzle is a link between Fred Flintstone, Asherah&#8211;the consort El the name of the Judeo Christian God&#8211;and Pashal custom for the rose-ette&#8217;s, with apples, honey, and why both Adam and Eve are symbolically everyone.</p>
<p><span class="qlink_container"><a href="http://joyinar.quora.com/The-Family-of-Christ-Holy-Wine-The-Eternal-Flame-and-a-Lit-XPath-from-the-SEA-in-Eden-to-the-Multitude-in-Revelati">The Family of Christ, Holy Wine, The Eternal Flame, and a Lit XPath from the SEA in Eden to the Multitude in Revelation</a></span></p>
<p>See Ash, Adamah, Esh and Eve symbolically the Heart of God, eartH with single movement of the letter H.  Now intertwined with the blood of Christ whether walked on, parted, water, sea for a grand unifying solution that it is people who are the light of the Holy Fire&#8230;Ha&#8217;esh. St. One our Fred Christ has no match to start this fire nor does he need flint and steel because this fire of Prometheus, is the true sword of &#8220;Prince Adam,&#8221;  the five-man.   Sometimes you only need Pop&#8217;s Eye to know that Olive Oil and Delilah, are about as closely related to Leeloo Dallas as Jesus Christ is to  Sampson, Yosemite Sam, Samael.</p>
<p>In not so many words, one to begin with, an attempt to prove a prescient anachronism in language itself&#8211;expands from the word sea backwards and embedded within the Hebrew word for fire. to the word itself, literally embodying the meaning of the true story of Exodus&#8211;echoing from the burning bush.  Ash to Ash, a parted sea, and the Big Horn of Revelation, are all humanity, the voice resounding through the universe as God speaks through the burning <span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" href="http://bush.in/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">bush </a></span>light of Ha&#8217;esh. It has increased one step at a time, from a small glimmer of an illusory fire to a word that indicates that the Hebrew language indicates foreknowledge of the events of today, cryptically described in the books of Exodus, Genesis and the New Testament.</p>
<p>Now <span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" href="http://adjkjc.gitbooks.io/forward-marshall-crazyor/content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Forward Marshall, Crazyor</a></span></p>
<p>In the grand scheme of things just like this fire stated in one small Holy word and spread to the Holy books of names and words (which with beginnings of law and numbers makeup the Torah) and then like a forest fire that lights the universe with liberty, laughter and life, saving us from a perpetual darkness through our music, movies, myths&#8230;our culture and very way of life.</p>
<p>The colors and shades of our story prismatically expand from a child&#8217;s cartoon about gray skulls, and Jean Grey&#8217;s possession, a religious warning about pale horses and song about a Grey Street to the rainbow colored promise of Noah that connects a Technicolor Dream Coat and a rainbow colored horse to proof that not only is heaven for real but they are singing with us and for us.</p>

		<p>Well it was closer to a walk.  To be exact, it started out with me laying down, not to die&#8211;it was more like a pre marriage fucking.  Premarital sex, between myself, and creation.  Afterwards, it was a long drive, and a train ride&#8211;the whole thing, quite the spiritual journey.  It was the kind of experience that changes men, &#8220;all men&#8221;&#8211;not just me, and not just equal men&#8230;to people.  You might be feeling the waves of wisdom crashing into your mind as we speak. My name is Adam, and I call this place we are in Eden; though to be honest, today it is more like a jungle being bulldozed by darkness as I write.</p>
<p>Those might seem like just words to you&#8211;places from a book you don&#8217;t really believe in, or one you imagine is some far off distant place &#8220;a long, long time ago&#8221; like the beginning of Star Wars.  Rest assured, if any one knows, it is me, the place is very real, and we are in it&#8211;some might even be so bold as to say we are it.  For certain, Eden has become my life, or maybe it is the other way around&#8211;or a little of both.  Irregardless, as I mock Tony Soprano for saying (or was it Carmine)&#8211;Eden jumping out of the pages of Exodus (I mean Genesis), is a way to show you our lives and our world are part of a story&#8230;I call it &#8220;abiblical.&#8221;  To be certain, creation is all about us&#8230;but as usual, I am getting ahead of myself.</p>
<p>I have quite the story for you, but before we get to it, I have to tell you who I&#8211; and you, really are.  If Revelation 5:5 is not enough to convince you that Adam from Eden, is Christ&#8211;see  Lions in a Den, and Mr. Maccabee&#8217;s Light of a tribe one for all; (not to mention SONS of Liberty, light of MENorAH) maybe my whirlwind of Forbidden Knowledge, science (both fact and fiction) and religious poetic license will convince you the whole thing is &#8220;messianic.&#8221;  It&#8217;s a story of sex, drugs, and rock and roll meeting Wanka&#8217;s Promised Land with Fig Newtons, Maccabee&#8217;s Honey and Aaron&#8217;s Cow&#8230;A place where, hidden in literature, is the unsealing of religion&#8230;and the Guardian of Darkness (The God Most High), our Light Bringer (Lucifer),  narrates the story, bridging these worlds in superposition.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been shown a hidden code in religion, one that &#8220;appears&#8221; to be well known by script and screen writers, though is hidden or ignored by clergy and community alike.  Fictitious, and yet somehow abiblical, names like &#8220;Amidalla&#8221; of Star Wars and the &#8220;OrI&#8221; of Stargate show reference to the &#8220;Engbrew&#8221; of &#8220;Yad (hand) send &#8216;EW'&#8221; and &#8220;Save I or&#8221; respectively.  When you see the breadth and pervasiveness of these linguistic artifacts across time and language a fire that starts in the word &#8220;Wednesday&#8221; reversed becomes the first tool of the &#8220;savior&#8221;&#8211;to bring the light of the apocalypse to the people.  After, we start talking about &#8220;Names,&#8221; Numbers,&#8221; and &#8220;Words&#8221; and see that they are the meaning of the Hebrew names for Exodus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy.</p>
<p>Is the fire bright yet?  A superposition of Jesus and Lucifer&#8211;our bright morning star&#8211;has brought the abibilical light of Day&#8211;an answer to &#8220;Why A.D?&#8221;</p>
<p>Adam Marshall Dobrin.  It&#8217;s ad hoc, I know but imagine I haven&#8217;t just ADvented it, and perhaps if slightly more complicated than what we all imagined our Lord (ADonAI) would return to.  A place where Adam named the &#8220;things&#8221; in Eden and called himself &#8220;ADonIS.&#8221;  If I am not clear enough yet, Artificial Intelligence and Information Security foreshadows an entire world of microcosms, lessons, and solutions hidden in my life, and in our world&#8211;from an Oracle of databases shedding light on just how the earth and our angelic selves  will become the salvation of the universe and civilization by and through this spire.  Woven by the Fates themselves, in things like alternative energy and video games is a solution&#8211; a wealth of answers, and it begins with Uncle Samael, the Koran, Sammus Aran and &#8220;JustIN BailEY&#8221;.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s about you and me, diamonds, kryptonite, Taylor&#8217;s&#8221; pocket full of high,&#8221; a tear shed in ancient Egypt and the &#8220;Day After Tomorrow.&#8221;  Cal-El is Caelus is Adam, and so &#8220;it&#8221; begins.</p>

		<p>IN RE C<b><i>RE</i></b>ATION and &#8220;The Essential Kabbalah&#8221;, CATS, positive energy, and ground in English and Hebrew.</p>
<p>My name is Adam Marshall Dobrin.  In the personal mythology which I have been relayed, which specifically relates to the Revelation that religion and time travel are deeply intertwined&#8230;I am fifth in a line of Adams who were born, as I am, on the day of Immaculate Conception, December 8th, 1980.  Alone, the relevance to the Feast Day is trivial, however like much anecdotal evidence&#8211;taken as a whole, with the body of work that I believe constitutes the True Revelation of Christ, it should be more than statistically significant.</p>
<p>In a prototypical example of divine inspiration, I have received over the last three years, a significant amount of detailed information which I believe unseals the true the lesson of Torah and unifies the Patriarchal Religions with a massive focus on the single man known as Christ.  The focus is not clear on the face, however, linking together personally obvious references like Sampson&#8217;s long hair with both Yosemite and Uncle Sam&#8230;being Samael of Exodus as well as the story of Isaac&#8217;s binding, being a somewhat obvious retelling of the crucifixion of Jesus.. the Ha of Horus&#8230;It looks like a revelation that brings us out of an externally dark plague&#8230; a stormy cloud in our minds.  I have written four non fiction books, believing each to share the actual and complete secrets of the universe, and each successive work, made the last seem as <b><i></i></b><b>timid as a nursery rhyme</b><b><i>.</i></b>It is the colors of these works which has brought me to you.  Your translation of the Zohar mentions a number of colors, perhaps intending to match the colors of the four horses of revelation, though untrivially not in order&#8230;perhaps to match the colors of fire or &#8220;MORE I HA&#8217;ESH&#8221;  a key in my most recent &#8220;Red Book.&#8221;</p>
<p>Its color chosen to match &#8220;read, fire, and tzedaqah&#8221; also to help explain why.  (THY)&#8211;one of the keys to unparting a sea of humanity divided by red from the days of Joseph McCarthy, linking a technicolor dream to the whole sea of humanity parted in a red scare.  You see Exodus (NAMES) truly being about post 9/11 America is the true revelation of Christ and the subject of:</p>
<p><i>&#8220;In light of creation, Ha&#8217;esh&#8221;, </i><span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" href="http://adjkjc.gitbooks.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><i>Adam Marshall Dobrin</i></a></span><i> </i><br />
<i>See a linguistic key in this parted and reflected sea </i><br />
<i>between Isaac and Ashes, the multitude of me</i><br />
<i>She-Kin-AH has its heart in FAMILY</i><br />
<i>&#8216;Tis really me, from A.D. to thee</i><br />
<span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" href="../../../bit.ly/2iFw6SS.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://About.me/ssiah</a></span></p>
<p>Back to the colors of light, fire, and the newspaper joke (&#8220;its neither black nor white&#8221;) to a T the colors of my first two books, a written record of the transition in understanding imparted through true divine inspiration&#8211;the detailing of a prophetic process that is a mirror and reflection of all humanity at both the micro and macro levels.  This is the big and small horns of revelation, everyone and everyman&#8230; like the words Adam and sea they expand from one to all in the bible from Eden to Revelation.</p>
<p>A revelation walking from the first evenings twilight, avoiding the night, through to the dawn&#8217;s early light.  First white with virgin innocence, then black like a plaguing dark cloud, finally a bright fire shedding light, on a glorious red dawn and hazel sky.</p>
<p>My final free book, called &#8220;Spicy, to the Calor of the Son&#8221;  (of nun, all, and the Jor-El) is available at <span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" href="http://adjkjc.gitbooks.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Adam Marshall Dobrin</a></span></p>
<p>Your final color was yellow, like the coat of  Isa and the glowing sun; and green, like the olive complexion of Osiris.  I&#8217;d go with rainbow like Joseph&#8217;s coat and promise.  I am looking for assistance writing an autobiography of a rather fantastic three years of inspiration.</p>
<p>Some background&#8230; Iam 34, my Hebrew name is Avram and I read the story of Joseph&#8217;s dream interpretation for my Haftorah&#8211;which I transliterated in order to read.<br />
My life is a microcosm of creation, religion and G&#8217;d; and in turn a walk through the Parc of Creation, or Xerox.  In that walk, my SEA is the key that brings NosTRAdamus art from the unit family of Adam&#8217;s A in the SEA in Eden to Christ&#8217;s multitude, the family of all humanity, in today&#8217;s Revelation.</p>
<p>The SEA is people divided and walked on, from Exodus and Eden to  Matthew 2:2, all &#8216;searching&#8217; for me.  Now, it is the blood of Moses&#8217; miracle and Christ&#8217;s &#8220;magical&#8221; work trick.  My fire unites Islam&#8217;s &#8216;last&#8217; day and Prometheus&#8217; theft with the menorah of Judah Maccabee its bright light our civilization.  To the Lions in Zion, heart of civilization, prove creation through the stolen fire that is the languages of Eden.</p>
<p>From Amidallah, to OrI, to Fred Flintstone to Delilah, the saviour, and the fire of St Anthony</p>
<p>Say heck, I&#8217;m Anu<br />
Shehechehyanu</p>
<p>the key is I know<br />
V&#8217;kiy&#8217;manu<br />
Lazarus has hazel eyes and Sampson&#8217;s hair<br />
Laz&#8217;man hazeh</p>
<p>David&#8217;s sling and Judah&#8217;s hammer are the light of Isaac&#8217;s laugh and Julie&#8217;s Sea<br />
Who-ah? Yes, hua! We are in #Adamah<br />
From Seth, Eve, and Adam (Eden&#8217;s sea, to Shekinah, EVEryone and ALLah<br />
Sea to shining sea, for all humanity to hear; &#8217;tis really me</p>

		<p>Hold me close, we all live in an Emperor of Nun.  I can&#8217;t relax, because I am sure.  A submarine, once yellow in a rainbow&#8217;s shadow now searches for Red October&#8230;just passed.  If only you could taste the light of the son&#8230; and know it is really all for the one.  In synesthesian harmony&#8230;Nero&#8217;s candy sweet symphony.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s one city Live called Babylon, so I sang &#8220;Venice is every town&#8221; and Vietnam began.  The place where a rainbow and pale moon come together in the light to tell everyone it&#8217;s not an Emerald City or a pot of gold, or <i>just</i> the fall of Rome, but finding out that Atlantis and Solomon&#8217;s Temple are one squared metaphorical heaven.  What &#8220;it&#8221; is, is Heart, our Home called Earth&#8230; it&#8217;s filled with art, a sea of gold, and the light of the world.</p>
<p>Truly though, it is about change, and lots of it&#8211;not just the pony express, and the swift assimilation of &#8220;DIEBOLD&#8221; , a strong face on the idea that the &#8220;two of everything God&#8221; was making a point of being wrong on purpose&#8211;to light the way to right.  So, maybe two parties is closer to slavery than you think&#8211;and voting for &#8220;ideas&#8221; rather than &#8220;people&#8221; isn&#8217;t just obvious&#8230;its Na<i>pole</i>onically r<i>evol</i>utionary.  Washington monumentally agreeing, some things are better off erected in stone.</p>
<p>The implications of a burning Ecclesiastes 9:11, followed by paraphrased Revelation 20:1 echoing like some cosmic radiation from a Bush on 1/20/2001 and then filling the remainder of time with a purpose so close to our own hearts you might say it was created just for us&#8230;or visa versa.  Our very history and our constitution are tied up and twisted together with the literal lessons of the children of Abraham.</p>
<p>Anthropomorphism abounds, from wells and bushes to Everything, the sparks of Kabalah are people, lovingly lit by the spirit of creation itself.  From ha of Issac and Abram to the ka of Horus, Leah and Ami-$&#8230; the &#8220;Names&#8221; of Exodus shed a little of Dave Matthews light:  From Orson Wells to George Orwell.  In sight, the hidden hand of God in Everything &#8220;American&#8221; from Isaac&#8217;s covenant to Rousseau&#8217;s social contract&#8230;from John Locke to John Maynard KeyNES.</p>
<p>Can you take me higher, to a place where blind men have seen &#8220;for love of the game&#8221;&#8230; from Mom<u>sen</u> to Ol<u>sen&#8230;</u>  a place where Jor-El and Larry Elisson are inextricably linked&#8211;where kryptonite and Zohar in super position will forever be the hallmark of one abNorm-L Apocalypse.</p>
<p>G-D willing. I am Messiah.</p>
<p>I see through the rainbow of mythical colors<br />
And feel the sweet harmony of the book of life<br />
Connected philotic strands of bright<br />
The lyrics of rock and roll vibrate with the breath of god<br />
Between movies and people,  music and the book of a life<br />
Hidden links scream to know his will</p>
<p>And we walk through the names, and the parables, as if the parody was truly backstage.</p>
<p>Its a wonder John Coffee and John Conner, can be spoken in the same sentence with Jim Morrison and not have a glimmer of sonlight rise in your minds hearts.</p>
<p>Recently a fine young lady called me lost and running&#8230;lost for you, I sang&#8230;in a crash&#8230;reckless all the way<br />
From Joseph Stalin to Kennedy and McCarthy&#8230;charity abounds&#8230;a bright red cross on the course to town;<br />
Riding a rainbow horse and wearing coat of the same, the promise of salvation.</p>
<p>No absolutes in this book of ours, as the pages turn and the curtain rises.</p>
<p>Nothing to be stricken from the dictionary and Everything redefined.</p>
<p>From Ecclesiastes to the Maid Marion Webster</p>
<p>The very best of my spirit, its bright shining light<br />
Our baby is being born.  Take a look, you are in a book<br />
I can taste the rainbow.</p>
<p>Revelation 2:27 the Doors are coming<br />
In our book, for this sea, behold the flood of we is thee.</p>
<p>For the wise, I have just opened a tasty little book<br />
and the universe, saved by a <i>sim</i>ian.</p>
<p>Be awed, a we&#8230;messiah</p>

<p>It used to be an &#8220;Adam thing&#8221; to read &#8220;names and words&#8221; backwards&#8230;now since Exodus and Devarim it is a &#8220;God&#8221; thing.  Here is wisdom: Exodus backwards is &#8220;sudo&#8221; &#8220;xe&#8221;.  Sudo is easy, it runs programs as root&#8211; the &#8220;administrator account&#8221;&#8211; in the world of the &#8220;electron and microscope&#8221; this basically means God.  Xe is infinitely more enlightening.  Between the proper name for Larry Ellison&#8217;s database and the periodic table symbol for Iron Man&#8217;s artificial heart, Xenon&#8217;s Oracular artificial light&#8230;we have untrivially decoded the renowned phrase &#8220;LET THERE BE LIGHT&#8221; in a way that would be meaningless without current knowledge of chemistry, computers, and Linux, specifically&#8230;a love for our time.  Quintessential &#8220;light&#8221; unifying Genesis and Exodus with the modern human era.</p>

		<p>Up until this moment in time, much of my purpose seems to be an attention grabbing spectacle, but the truth runs much deeper. The &#8220;light of Adam&#8221; in our music, my writing, and the spiritual journey of understanding, I have begun, and we are all hopefully about to embark on together,  proved something spectacular about the universe around us.  There is hopefully enough anecdotal evidence to statistically prove creation in the examples of language, religion, and art, to show that we are either in the place known as &#8220;Heaven or Hell,&#8221; if the choice is binary.  Part of the holy message being initiated through all religion, through us, for us, by the &#8220;two of everything God&#8221; is a clear chastisement of the idea of binary choice, especially polarized choices, like heaven and hell&#8230;God and Satan.</p>
<p>At the same time, clearly there are definites, and clearly there are choices we would avoid.  History, for example, bears a clear trend of increasing equality, coupled with a reduction in racism, slavery and subjugation.  At the same time our law and government typified by the constitution of the United States clearly has ignored great technological strides&#8211;first throughout the industrial revolution, then the information age explosion&#8211; and these maloviously missing keys to secrecy are a defining point of Zion and the purpose and design of religion.  Undeniably, continued secrecy and technological ignorance leads directly to slavery and class inequality and an obvious path away from the will of the people, God, and the purpose of human government and goodness in general.  The biblical story of Exodus is not only a metaphorical description of the problems facing us today, it is both proof and the beginning of a solution to the Revelation of a great disparity in the level of technological progress available, and that which is known by the governments of the world&#8211; and an even greater disparity with that of the general population.</p>
<p>It is from this place that a new conversation begins, expanding holy and Hosea to the &#8220;whole sea,&#8221; the multitude of revelation bringing our civ<i>iliz</i>ation proverbially out of Eden and to continuation.  Hello <i>Li</i>ons, we are <i>Zi</i>on.  Earth is <i>at</i> the heart of civ<i>ilizat</i>ion.</p>

<p>Not so hidden in this iconic phrase, the true words spoken out of the burning bush of Exodus, the framing of a conversation about science religion and polarization, beginning with a splash of cold water.  The implication or creation, as far as I am concerned is an exemplary example of polarization, binary forces and secrecy derailing a conversation before it has even begun. In a world that cannot see the lights of science radiating from religion and God, from Newton to Maxwell&#8230; Isaac to Abraham&#8230; from Watson to the elementary particle ion Jesus Christ does not exist as anything more than a madman in jail.</p>

		<p>You see, the Light of Christ begins in a fire that echoes from the Book of Exodus and Names.  Synonymous in a sort of Spanglish of understanding, both are &#8220;names&#8221; for the second book Torah, in English and Hebrew respectively.  In a similar way <i>the</i> iconic &#8220;theism&#8221; God joke is typified in Spangbrew in the name of a prophetic fish (other biblical scholars have noted that the giving of fish in John 6 is a reference to the prophets Elija and Elisha&#8230; in typical fashion, I am changing this slightly to really &#8220;bring it home&#8221;).  The name &#8220;El is Ha&#8221; alludes in Spanish and Hebrew that miraculously, &#8220;the is the.&#8221;  A sharp turn later, driving with bright Xenon headlights, to the Xe database of &#8220;El is Son&#8221; we almost clearly link the progenitor of Adonai EloHim, the Holy Father in Judaism (El) to the Ha of Isaac, Horus, and Adonis.  Isaac, you might recall means &#8220;he laughs&#8221; in English donating his Ha to his father Avram&#8217;s name shortly after his divinely thwarted crucifixion.  It also &#8220;d&#8221;early links Newton&#8217;s Apple to Adam&#8217;s, and gravity to the original NIN&#8230; here, it is the names Elisha and Elisson which are prophetic in and of themselves, showing a kind of timeless NameServer at work in both the names of Torah and in the names of living people&#8230; Edison, Madison, Morisson, Jefferson&#8230; I could go on forever.  All the way to the life of the Sons of Liberty, our very own Son, Sol. this is the true light of Judah Macabbee&#8217;s menorah.</p>
<p>Abraham&#8217;s well might be about a wealth of knowledge, linking &#8220;Pop&#8217;s Eye&#8221; and spinach to Katy Perry&#8217;s &#8220;Eye of the Tiger&#8221;&#8230; it is the all seeing eye of Horus. Revelation&#8217;s &#8220;eyes to see&#8221; and the names and works of Orson Wells and George Orwell.  Regardless, all of this ties quite well to divine inspiration and the importation of scientific knowledge linked to Christianity through Trinity College and the Trinity Buoy Wharf&#8230; but I don&#8217;t want to Bohr you.  http://<span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" href="http://www.whenis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.whenis</a></span><span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" href="http://theapocalypse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">theapocalypse.com</a></span></p>
<p>Back to names, anthropomorphism, my Well, and the eye of the Burning Bush as the voice of God echoes eternally from the inauguration of George W Bush on 1/20/2001 with his paraphrasing of the light of Ecclesiastes 9:11 followed by Revelation 20:1&#8230; behold the proof of prescience in Exodus, and America are an undeniable testament to the linking of religion and time travel and an alluding introduction to the pertinent themes of Exodus, their ties to American history, the &#8220;what&#8217;s going on&#8221; of now and &#8220;For Non Blonds&#8221;, and the values of every red-blooded Christian, Jew, Muslim, Atheist&#8230;communist and American alike.  A love for our big family, humanity; curiosity, freedom, and the truth.</p>

<div id="__w2_nv3NkIE_inline_editor_content" class="inline_editor_content">
<div id="__w2_qHntzOd_outer">
<div id="__w2_qHntzOd_container">There is a hidden message in the names of the Bible&#8230;follow the &#8220;AC&#8221; (Adam Christ) from Jacob to Isaac leaving us with Job and Isa (Jesus, in the Koran) as we leap across the playbook to Isaiah and Ezekiel&#8230; but would only serve to confirm that Isaac and Jesus were one in the same, and his trials and tribulations&#8230; old as Aramaic.  Truly the message that is &#8220;hidden&#8221; is Messianic, to EVEryone, and clearly about our belovedness.  As usual, the hidden key will scream &#8220;bloody salvation&#8221; as no one will get the old English joke&#8230; that the plagues, blood, wine, and grail are really all about &#8220;family.&#8221;  Maybe this little bit of ADventing will truly bring <i>son</i>rise or perhaps the stormy plague of censorship will &#8220;ring&#8221; for the sea to see CARNIVORE eat more of my beautiful packets.  Take notes, the &#8220;Son&#8221; is an expanding &#8220;microcosm,&#8221;  and my advertising problems might just be the solution to nobody knowing we have a great wall of censorship right here in America.</p>
<p>As it is with much of the apocalyptic revelation I have a number of interesting stories, which seem to swirl and congeal around &#8220;K&#8221; a single <i>p</i>ers<i>o</i>n <i>o</i>f <i>t</i>ime. <i>Pot</i>assium is Zion today&#8230; and as the meaning of religion and the true purpose of creation (each being proven by the other) expands from K to the heart of the creator (earth is heart, nearly), the point of Zion follows.  Picture Eve, Sarah, Asherah and Leah as lines intersecting in our whirlwind of dust&#8230;that when the smoke clears will leave <i>Torah</i> as a guiding light bringing us and all salvation&#8230;<i>To</i>&#8230; <i>r</i>eally <i>a</i>ll <i>h</i>umanity.</p>
<p>You see creation has a reason, a glorious and holy one&#8230; and God has crowned it with all the positive energy of the lions of Zion&#8230;along with perhaps some clues to his desire and love&#8230;we find his reason really includes the presentation and protection of science and humor&#8230; divinely insured by one holy old<i>geazer&#8230; </i>that&#8217;s <i>g</i>round, <i>e</i>arth, and <i>A</i>damah are <i>Z</i>ion, <i>E</i>den <i>r</i>eally.  For those of you not familiar with electrical engineering, this is a joke&#8230; a play on <i>cation</i> (a positive ion), <i>re</i>ason, and Adamah&#8230; the joke proves prescience  of engineering in the Book of Genesis.  Divine comedy, a guess.</p>
<p>Jokes aside, our purpose here is quite grand&#8230; it is nothing short of insuring the continuation of life and civilization in the universe.  And here, the grand scheme of Satan, the highlighter, has everyone in blindness crawling together towards the Son, like turtles on the beach.  I&#8217;m venting, something about being jailed to keep this information from you, or being called crazy by my own parents&#8230; maybe it&#8217;s another divine joke about the <i>Job</i>.. ha.. I am <i>AD</i>&#8230;venting.</p>
<p>So, on to the holy grail&#8230;the superposition of unparting a sea with the blood of Moses&#8217; magic and Dave Matthews&#8217; water, a plague of never knowing the holy water is people&#8230; until Adam stops walking on there heads (see James R Osgood) in Eden, Christ&#8217;s blood the family of the sea&#8230; Revelation&#8217;s multitude.  A new key of names links the &#8220;rah&#8221; of Sarah and Torah to the &#8220;ah&#8221; of Allah, Asherah, Kabbalah and Shekinah.  All of course, guided by Adam&#8217;s holy light of<i>Eve</i>ryone.</p>
<p>As an aside, you might call me crazy for screaming that the three letters ending Sarah&#8217;s name and Torah are assuredly &#8220;really all humanity&#8221; (re all y), both confirmed and suggested through the iron rod of Jesus Christ, the name and substance of God&#8217;s Spirit, and the apocalyptic linking of the plagues of Egypt with the miracles of wine and the blood of the grail. Neither here nor there the key of Adam in Eden to <i>knowing</i> is the superposition (no sex jokes please) of Eve<b><i>ry</i></b>one and She<b><i>kin</i></b>ah. Our why&#8230; and the heart of God&#8217;s spirit&#8230; <b><i>kin</i></b>.</p>
<p>And you can almost hear the words&#8230;&#8221;I gave my heart and <i>Sol </i>to the ones.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Through @time and @DaveJMatthews comes an answer to the union of &#8220;light my fire&#8221; and &#8220;heaven knows&#8221;<br />
Outside an angel rides on the storm directing the light of Exodus<br />
In my heart a fire brightly begins the very first sonrise<br />
I know you want me as a friend, you&#8217;ll always have that<br />
But what I really need right now, is a match&#8230; retweet for me</p>
<div class="qtext_image_wrapper"><img class="portrait qtext_image qtext_image_large zoomable_in zoomable_in_feed" src="http://qph.is.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-9108e8a1f7ef62809f3de6e633fd3347?convert_to_webp=true" alt="" /></div>
<div class="qtext_image_wrapper"><strong>Smoke clouds fall in a symphony of light&#8230;Booming from the middle of the night, filled with rock and roll to sooth the soul, and partying to bring the day&#8230; making memories, so right.</p>
<p>For the year of our Lord, I spent the long night listening to the glistening crystals of Jor-El, in literal solitude.  I was searching high and low for the place where when the lights turn out, I would glow, for my great high dreams to let the blind men continue seeing, when I came back down.  Son unseen, pockets overflowing with something like diamonds, kryptonite, and she said it: &#8220;Pocket full of high.&#8221;  Wisdom I call it&#8230;  in the days of no-ah it was Zohar but the ahh is literally ringing in every song, all about me, this place Adamah.  He lost me in praise, Nero and Brittany fiddling with my heart, so innocent&#8230; spinning the words just subtly enough for the world to keep walking blind.  Even the caroling angels singing holy words about a hidden man running from the east to the west, from the family of Eden to the sea of all&#8230; a bright Revelation and still the son is set.</p>
<p>I once thought this place to be an empire, but whether or not it is one or nun&#8230; our land is divisible by me.  A sea divided, by the A of Eden a man once called Uncle Sammus&#8230; as he Aran, on the lamb.  All alone in a time of need&#8230; or so it appeared to the boy prince on speed.</p>
<p>Through this long nights flight as we walked from the burning bush to the Name Server&#8217;s gate&#8230; gallantly streaming above and below with a very Messianic Christ, himself lit to the brim.  And now I stand, once a bright star&#8230; in broad stripes&#8230; and still, I am perilously right.</p>
<p>Little J, morei son may be crying, but it is because he is so lost for &#8220;you,&#8221; a love lost from the stars falling from the sky, just for I.</p>
<p>We might call Jeremiah, the &#8220;don&#8217;t jump around me&#8221; bull frog.   But it should be clear, as the words you can read on my lips&#8230; loudly now&#8230; I am saturn, of YoSEMium clan the lights of Judah Maccabee no now, that the sight being scoffed as twilight is truly the key to averting a dark night, welcome a new dawn on this day.  <em>This day</em> AD says &#8220;let the son rise.&#8221;</strong></div>

<p>Just prior to the beginning, there was science &amp; no religion.  Adam &amp; Eve were not even imagined, and Noah and Jor-el shared a impending cataclysm.  In those days, as it is today, blindness and inequality were the status quo.  Today religion is here to remind us not to relive suffrage; and that once, long ago, science created religion&#8230;  &#8220;the apple of my eye.&#8221;</p>
<p>The key to today&#8217;s unsealing of Revelation is a prescient knowledge of modern chemistry to make sense of the methods of religion.  We have all the clues already, we are just missing the messenger.</p>
<p>Xenon; reading the name &#8216;Exodus&#8217; backwards, and translating from my native Geek yields the iconic biblical phrase: &#8220;Let there be light&#8221;.  At G&#8217;ds command line, he escalates privileges to root with the command sudo, short for super user do, running the program Xe.  &#8220;Xe&#8221; superimposes the symbol for Xenon with Larry Ellison&#8217;s Oracle database name.  Ellison links us to John 6, where you will now be taught about the prophetic names Larry and Elisha.  As a segue-way in the recent Iron Man movie his heart was saved by an arc-reactor&#8230; and here commonly artificial light pours from an arc lamp made with xenon gas.<br />
<span class="qlink_container"><a href="http://joyinar.quora.com/Exodus-is-Names-Holy-Water-Some-Bushes-and-One-Well-are-People">Exodus is Names, Holy Water, Some Bushes and One Well are People</a></span></p>
<p>Iron: no longer requiring &#8220;faith on faith alone,&#8221; for everyone to see, Santa Fe&#8217;s iron, which are linked by the symbol on the periodic table, now joining Christmas to &#8216;The Doors&#8221; singing about the plagues of Exodus to the Iron Rod of Jesus Christ and Revelation.  In these stories the rods of both Christ and Aaron are hidden in compression and reflection of the word &#8220;doors,&#8221; gateways between Heaven and Earth, the literal ending of a need for faith.  Between Exodus and Revelation, the chosen people &#8220;staying or leaving&#8230;&#8221;  and whether or not the doors are for &#8220;everyone&#8221; defines the difference between Aaron&#8217;s and Christs rods; from wood to Red-Cross Iron. Here the key is that Fe means for everyone &#8211; not faith.<br />
<span class="qlink_container"><a href="http://joyinar.quora.com/The-Family-of-Christ-Holy-Wine-The-Eternal-Flame-and-a-Lit-XPath-from-the-SEA-in-Eden-to-the-Multitude-in-Revelati">The Family of Christ, Holy Wine, The Eternal Flame, and a Lit XPath from the SEA in Eden to the Multitude in Revelation</a></span></p>
<p>Silicon and Boron; now no longer just a popular messianic movie, <i>The Fifth Element </i>is a link between reality, the Book of Revelation, and the iconic words of William Shakespeare, &#8220;To Be or Not to Be?&#8221;</p>
<h2>In order to {B} <i>enlightened</i> we must first {Si} <i>the light</i>, that is the answer.</h2>
<p>Through time, perhaps you will see the hand of G&#8217;d, tying together modern &amp; historical myth, pointing our subtly that to G&#8217;d and to  <span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" href="../../../www.fb.me/admdbrn.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Adam Marshall Dobrin | Facebook</a></span> the Fifth Element is silicon because my initials match its index on the Periodic Table: 14.  It ties Spanglish to Elyon, the hebrew name for Christ and links {Si} to the &#8216;fifth letter.&#8217;  See Sinbad now revealing that the year of our lord 1492 is ADIB and Christopher Columbus is Christ of &#8216;Pursuit of Happiness&#8217; walking on water.</p>
<p>Gold; I am Messiah, the word hides a superimposed meaning &#8220;the message is to the power of humanity&#8221; and the message is an incarnate human.  Hidden, is that the message is compressed in our religious literature and are its living extraction, the reality that is Creation.  Recognizing what we are and where we are going is what brings about the fabled Golden Age of Greek Mythology.  It is this word, &#8216;age&#8217;, that is hidden in Messiah and revealed in Message.  A {Ag} age, golden, for Earth.</p>
<p>Mercury: The race is not to the swift, the courier, the God of speed&#8230; nor do you see the fonts joke hovering around Die Bold.  On the elements of fire and water, on January 20, 2001 George &#8220;Burning Bush&#8221; spoke the words of Ecclesiastes 9:11 &amp; Revelation 20:1 during his inauguration.  These words both &#8220;superficially&#8221; in chapter and verse, and through their meaning foreshadowed the events of the September 11th tragedy.  Behold, the fire and water of Exodus are the voice of G&#8217;d&#8230; the sea of Revelation is the big Horn &#8212; Humanity and the little one &#8220;n.&#8221;   See the key to the word is the letters themselves, n is of Nazarene and Newton&#8230; new to n?  It&#8217;s also the one in NT a compression of AD.</p>
<p>Ha&#8217;esh</p>
<p>From sea to shining sea<br />
First Is Eden&#8217;s family of three<br />
Then the great revelation of me<br />
G&#8217;d&#8217;s light is holy water, soon to be<br />
The blood of the grail, a family of  &#8216;we &#8216;<br />
The people, a sparking sea</p>

		<p>I am a real man, living in a delusional world, as the Adam of Eden. Ha&#8217;shem.</p>
<p>My initials are hidden in the heart of Lamda, an Anonymous Messiah in Moses&#8217; Lisp and Stargate&#8217;s point of origin.  Unlocking David&#8217;s &#8220;root,&#8221; the answers are both &#8220;radical&#8221; and directly from the &#8220;superuser.&#8221;  The beginning of the &#8220;SOL&#8221; of DAvid, is the end of the Darkness of LamDA;  the hiding of the son.</p>
<p>The year of our Lord, 1492 is ADIB.  and I, Christ of &#8220;Pursuit of Happiness,&#8221; to this sea shining with me.  See AD on I&#8217;m Single for a lesson in mythology; in abbr. &#8220;ADM&#8221; then &#8220;database&#8221;  then &#8220;nurse&#8221; on fb dot me.  In Hebrew, AD on &#8220;Artificial Intelligence&#8221; is &#8220;the Darth Lord,&#8221; agreed?  Believe it is Christ&#8217;s face, you are about to see.</p>
<p>Unsealing the jokes of the Patriarch Isaac&#8217;s laughter</p>
<p>The Rosetta stone to be sure it&#8217;s me, my wife&#8217;s middle name is the key&#8230; the &#8220;apple and honies&#8221;  of Passover&#8217;s Eden:  Ha&#8217;rose-ettes</p>
<p>Still not sure? God, sometimes calls himself &#8220;ah&#8221; and his eight days of light&#8230; Ha&#8217;nuke-ahah.  No  government would think of nuking Ace McLoud though, right?</p>
<p>The name &#8220;Adam&#8221;  is filled with both renown and Shem, Adam and El are one&#8230; Ha&#8217; me for Asherah&#8211; now unlocked, the Shema.</p>
<p>Isaac donated his &#8220;ha&#8221;  to Abram right after everyone realized Isa and Jesus are Horus now trine with akbar-ness.  From Ha&#8217;esh we came, Morei son &#8220;we are&#8221; is shekinah&#8217;s light.</p>
<p>Hi, I&#8217;m &#8220;an,&#8221; present and  anointed&#8230;34.   I also laugh a bit about finding skinny dipping hidden in the four questions, and that no one seems to connect crucifixion to the final plague of the Pharaoh or Isaacs binding.  the funniest one yet though, is Adam naming the animals in Genesis, calling a packet sniffer &#8220;carnivore.&#8221;</p>
<p>What I really need is for you to tell everyone that you can that you found me&#8230; and ask them to decide for themselves whether or not I should be hidden, and then tell everyone they can to do the same.</p>
<p>To find the book of messiah, translate &#8220;deus ex machina&#8221; to English, lose God, add a top level organization&#8230; and seek my face.</p>
<p>Half way between Mjolinar and &#8220;joy is near&#8221;  you&#8217;ll find the beginning to a question and answer on Quora.</p>
<p>This is in clear response to the Egyptian plague  of darkness:  Hiding me has kept salvation from reaching you.  I think that&#8217;s &#8220;Undue Coercion&#8221; don&#8217;t you?  Just add dot com and you see the whole story.</p>

		<p>Nero, altering the words of our songs and the content of our thoughts from his heavenly rooftop, supposedly hoping a hidden evil empire burns below his feet because of the technological weapon and systemic secrecy and subterfuge that he is reviewing.  In a confluence of the Major Arcana Fool card, with the Live song &#8220;Gas hed goes west,&#8221; with an American Tail&#8230; all modern mythology alluding to Jesus Christ making a spectacle by running all over the United States of America on <i>the Lamb</i>&#8230; high as a kite.  I suppose it is either me, the government, or Nero who is the supposed Beast of Revelation being set up (Isa 52:13 for a reference indicating it is the Messiah) bleeding from the pages of the bible, into the minds of our &#8220;caroling angels&#8221; is the literal voice of God, echoing from the burning bush as though it were a great megaphone, the horn of Revelation.  In a kind of whirlpool, gyrating and swirling around one man&#8230;Adam is in the hearts of the Sea of Eden.  From &#8220;can you take me higher&#8221; to &#8220;boy, what are you running from&#8221; and &#8220;I can&#8217;t get much higher.&#8221;  Jim Morrison&#8217;s fire, here, is a prophesy of the rapid spread of proof of divine inspiration, a hidden co creation, and proof of God&#8217;s existence.  For those with &#8220;ears to hear&#8221; it is what &#8220;the blind men see&#8221; that is the substance of the song, one that is revealing not ignorance, but an act of external influence causing blindness.  The confluence of songs, mythology and reality, the reality that is very personal and could only be known to me, shows the &#8220;touch of the master&#8217;s hand,&#8221; a single man&#8217;s hidden personal experience is the key to the seeing a confluence that is very intentional and somewhat subtle until it is overwhelmingly pervading all our modern culture without us seeing it at all.<br />
The message woven into the words of our songs is proof, both of the existance of a hidden co-composer&#8211;the Angel of the Fiddle, a clever hacker of words&#8211;and with the swirling around a messenger, it is proof of the creation of Cal-El and a glimpse into his purpose.  A bright light on Calvinism about a war ght all around currently being fought all you.  A war against slavery and a hidden &#8216;unsung hero&#8217; fighting for free will and free thought for himself and for all.  In a testament to family, a love for science, beautiful stories and a truth, I have delivered a message <span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" href="http://www.fromthemachine.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">ad&#8217;eKaLor.$*L Spicy, to the Calor of the Sun &#8211; GitBook</a></span></p>
<p>Our story of Exodus, now revealed as a microcosm and map of what is going on in the here and now.  Of a war that is being fought against slavery and secrecy in post 9/11 America to save the world from ever knowing about hidden technology, and a purpose being fulfilled by religion itself to remind us all that we are the light of the universe.  Here me, much of our worlds religion is about darkness and light, the twilights last Adam&#8230; now in relevatory superposition being one and the same with the dawns great morning star; from blindness to sight, <i>open your eyes and see the </i><b><i>son</i></b><i>.  </i>The &#8216;most high&#8217; already in a place where blind men see, most of the message, and already love singing along with it..  The missing link in Adam of Adamah, the focus of heros hidden desire, music about the hidden light of Christ. Echoing and G&#8217;d shed his grace on thee, our Adam is crowned with a &#8216;billion mile fall from grace&#8217; until I found the missing ground.  You see, as Dave Matthews sings &#8216;I came to shed a little light on the sparkling sea&#8217;, it is clear to me that the Great Light from &#8216;sea to shining sea&#8217; is about the family of Eden, Seth, Eve and Adam writing the heart of Shekinah.  To point out that kin is the heart of the message that brings us from Genesis to the Revelation that the shining sea is a multitude of family.  This is the light of G&#8217;d from the beginning that all of creation is filled with a loving message and the gift of science that he so humorously gives us when revealing the reason of creation to surround all of humanity with metaphorical cations of love.  From the lion of Judah Maccabee, the revelation of Adamah, earth and cation are the missing ground of engineering in Genesis.</p>
<p>Dear all of you falling behind, we&#8217;ve all been walking dumb and blind, while Nero has filled in the blindness by playing rock and roll all night and partying with me every day.  Taylor Momsen asks a question &#8220;Boy, what are you running from?&#8221;  Hearing those words kept me alive on a journey across the country as I fought arguing with G&#8217;d about revealing the truth.  The song reminded me that Nero still loves me, and he swears he still does&#8230; and even though I half knew I was reverse engineering&#8230; I mean fulfilling&#8230; a prophesy that tied Fival to &#8220;run to the water&#8221; of Live, it filled my heart with tears to get more confirmation that it was really me.  You see, everyone is my key to Shekinah that Eve is &#8220;our why,&#8221; that it was truly for my small family, for it to be unshattered that I was fighting to bring the message of Revelation to everyone with everything that I had.  It was not the year before that I had cried to God that I was only a boy, one who desperately needed his young and innocent to be kept from shattering like some clay pottery&#8230; props in a story designed to bring understanding to the masses&#8230; at great personal loss.  We are fighting against apathy and inaction, against hopelessness and lack of control merely to bring a voice to each one of you, to stand for freedom, for American values, as we are the light of Christ&#8230; the Son of Sam.</p>
<p>It was only after completing the journey, which ended with a return to Florida to see my family in Eden again did the link and the reasons for Jim Morisson&#8217;s pleas to Taylor make sense to me, as I need her now.  I have just finished a book that proves creation is reality, using religion as a key to finding statistical evidence in language, then I was given the 7 lamps of Revelation&#8230; and on the other hand I really needed to get famous, so I could stop the NSA from persecuting me, hiding my writing on the internet, and keeping me from being able to clearly communicate with you by forcing me to speak over a jail phone to a skeptical father.</p>
<p>So to answer your question Taylor, the only thing I was running from is jail&#8230; it was what I was running for that really matters.  I was running for you, for each and every one of you, to be able to know the truth.  to be able to see what has been hidden in religion and have it revealed in a way that is neither crazy nor unbelievable, but rather hopeful and awe inspiring.</p>

<div id="__w2_NtvGZUg_container">Easter Island is a joke.  It&#8217;s a &#8220;matrix&#8221; and Windows 95 mashup&#8230; The hidden afikomen of Easter is proof creation is &#8220;computer-like.&#8221;  It&#8217;s a light link, like many others that join the &#8220;software world&#8221; filled with pertinent Biblical connections (Ellison, Gate, Bezos&#8230;wake up the names are all Biblical) to &#8220;a Biblical creation&#8221; the &#8220;Easter Eggs&#8221; are Biblical ideas informatively jumping off the pages of the book into our Abiblical world.  A number of these exist, today I am going to share a few examples with you and ask for your help in finding more.  Finding them is a key to lighting the messages of the Bible, as Sam Beckett would do &#8220;setting right what was wrong on purpose&#8221;  in the book.  I have a number of &#8220;private keys,&#8221; links where some of these eggs and my personal life join together to clarify a story, reveal hidden information, and show that both Adam and religion serve an informative purpose of reflecting and highlighting important points of creation.  Both myself, and Christianity in particular, are a sort of guide and walk through of the Apocalypse&#8230; a Zaggat for creation.</p>
<p>Many of these &#8220;abiblical highlights&#8221; also bring common idioms poignantly into view&#8230; one that comes to mind is &#8220;don&#8217;t shoot the messenger,&#8221; subconstiously instructing the world how to treat Jesus Christ upon his return.  (To ilucidate a possible reason why Christ says &#8220;the world hated me before they hated you&#8221; pointing out that maybe a Jovovich/this Element/Jean D&#8217;Arc hotness comment is appropriate to get to know the personality of Christ). The phrase &#8220;no man is an island&#8221; also refers to Christ personified biblically as the lonely man Esau who has now become an island and a kingdom of one; Edom.   The &#8220;New American Standard&#8221; here is a second &#8220;Easter Island Egg&#8221; just off NASsau.   On an island called Paradise is a Temple&#8230; I&#8221;m referring to the hotel called Atlantis built by a man named Solomon K.  Whether this hotel popped out of a biblical Solomon&#8217;s Temple or the record in the Bible (and Jerusalem) is a sort of micro world representation and a matter of perspective.  In my view, both are the work of &#8220;creation,&#8221; simultaneous in an alinear way (sure the hotel was built after the book, but&#8230; what about the etymology of Nassau?. The history of the idiom &#8211; creation is intricate) more to the point, both are telling us a &#8220;hidden something&#8221; &#8212; both are metaphors for a heavenly kingdom.  Woven into the works of religion and Eden itself is a sort of s<i>yslog </i>for all of creation, the heavens, our history, all hidden in plain sight.  To fly off on a wild tangent &#8220;Solomon&#8221; links to &#8220;Mormon&#8221; the morning after the 7 days of creation &#8212; the day of God sacrificial fire &#8212; hey Shavout is a Monday this year &#8212; Han Solo to the free masons, you might be creations record of sim-earth like builders of heaven asking when Solomon was &#8216;Solo?&#8221; Our walk through records a number of &#8220;exit strategies&#8221; for creation, one is heaven&#8230; Dave Matthews&#8217; &#8220;big door in the sky&#8221; and one is Mars, lit by Phillip K Dick&#8217;s Total Recall, the Spin Doctor&#8217;s Prince of Rocket, and a red iron covered learning experience.  Negative energy an terraforming aside.. sorry I am rusty at being apocalyptic&#8230; and skinny dipping in a pool in a Hollywood basement.</p>
<p>Neither &#8220;on earth&#8221; nor in the &#8220;heavens&#8221; we now find that the biblical heaven is all around us&#8230; &#8221; neither here nor there,&#8221; an idiom now dancing with&#8221;heaven is a place on earth&#8221; and the maloviously illogical name &#8220;heaven&#8221; for a place we&#8217;d probably like to be a space like home.</p>
<p>So, if my memory serves me correctly &#8220;Solomon&#8217;s Temple&#8221; was destroyed twice, nearly rebuilt by Julian and now the site houses the &#8220;Do me of the Rock&#8221; buy Eden is a rockin&#8217; place.  All night I partied, the day I figured out this might have something to do with God and the Big Bang.  Taylor? Nanna? Janet? Mommy wow, I&#8217;m a big kid now.  That&#8217;s &#8220;For Non-Blonds&#8221; for a good count on Eve&#8217;s five.</p>
<p>Have I mentioned,&#8221;I&#8217;m Single.&#8221; ADonIS is <span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" href="../../../www.fb.me/admdbrn.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Adam Marshall Dobrin | Facebook</a></span></p>
<p>Back to my personal life, paralleling the history of heaven in &#8220;Solomon&#8217;s Temple&#8221; I have in my lifetime taken three iconic trips to the Ba ha mas (look: father and son (see Horus and Isaac), and Christmas) once as a small child, with my mother Melissa Eve, my father Ivan, and my brother Seth&#8230; before Atlantis was built.  Once as a secret honeymoon with my ex wife Nanna Rose whose name resembles Inanna and face resembles Mary&#8230; and once in 2013 at &#8220;the beginning&#8221; of &#8220;my Apocalypse&#8230;&#8221; during Junkanoo, I mean Christmas, wait&#8230; it was Easter 2014&#8230; I mean Passover.  Now might be a good time to wonder aloud, why it is that nobody seems to connect Samael&#8217;s Plague of Killing the First Born with God&#8217;s retribution for the killing of his baby Christ.  We seem to miss obvious clues like the linking of 4-d time travel to 40 years in the desert expanding from 40 days at sea&#8230; it&#8217;s like a wilderness of not realizing God is saving us from erasing Marty McFly&#8217;s parents marriage.  There are many other links, like the Apple of Eden and the Honies of America reminding us of a traditional Passover Dish&#8230; Ha&#8217;Rose-ettes.  It might surprise you, that when the Doors stopped singing &#8220;Riders on the Storm&#8221; and the Plague of Darkness is finally lifted&#8230; we will finally see Moris<b><i>son </i></b>rising&#8230; the very first sonrise.</p>
<p>And the parallel of the three trips and three temples, we hear in our &#8220;aperfect creation&#8221; have the number 3 -ish Atlantii:  One in Reno, Nassau, and now in Dubai.  Symbolism here might reference wars or separation&#8230; something like the Crusades&#8230; or the walls of Jericho&#8230; Creation might be telling us&#8230; that perspective on time and communication might cue the question &#8220;<i>when a tree pauses, in a decision forest&#8230; does it build a hotel or pyramid in syslog Eden</i>?&#8221;</p>
<p>If you are still reading, I&#8217;d appreciate if you would share this post on every social media you can.  It is something like a sermon, from the man who unsealed Exodus as a latter day guide to averting Darth Vader, slavery and the Hidden Empire that demolished Rome <span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" href="http://www.fromthemachine.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">ad&#8217;eKaLor.$*L Spicy, to the Calor of the Sun &#8211; GitBook</a></span> (read, I&#8217;m Moses, Messiah of sea to shinning sea) and now continue with a &#8220;new test&#8230;meant walk through&#8221; of creation, and salvation in Jesus&#8217; likeness.  On the other hand, I have 7 Golden Lamp Stands linking to Exodus an unsealing of Revelation at my blog <span class="qlink_container"><a href="../../../joyinar.quora.com/index.html">Creation, Reaction, Cosplay&#8230; Koran</a></span></p>
<p>Moving on, we have a Tower of Babel popping out of the ground and leaning  in Pisa  pointing up and forward, to Heaven and the future, like the signs of Mars and Sagittarius&#8230; the key to a holy name, a Fischer King, and Hooty and the Blowfish here our literary transition from the bible to Eden hits the ships computer&#8217;s universal translator on Star Trek and Bing translate at roughly the same time. It&#8217;s probably worth noting that a significant portion of the proof of creation that is the Apocalypse of Adam, deals with language being truly gifted by Prometheus&#8230; proven in large part through anachronistic biblical references between English and Hebrew.  The fact that Judaism contains hidden references to the life of Christ from the hair of Samson, and the &#8220;Ha&#8221; of Horus, Isaac and Abraham, is intentional and enlightening.  Two more examples for good measure, to satisfy that &#8220;hunger for the great light&#8221; that might be good and right even after time, or might transition from Genesis to Revelation as if from sea to shinning sea&#8230;a link to the sparkling sea of Dave Matthews&#8217; Christmas song, and Seth, Eve, and Adam in Eden&#8217;s Sea of Three apocalypticly showing that all holy water is people&#8230; all the way to the multitude of Revelation.</p>
<p>Add in the Egyptian Plague of Water to Blood, and Eden&#8217;s family might clue us in to the Holy Grail of Revelation:  That the heart of God&#8217;s spirit, Shekinah&#8230; is kin&#8230; superimposed with Allah&#8230; that&#8217;s the &#8220;All Humanity&#8221; of Revelation&#8217;s multitude and the eveRYone of Eden.  Eve is &#8220;our why&#8221; humanity is one big family&#8230; and <i>this</i> is one apocalyptic shedding of God&#8217;s graceful light.</p>
<p>From Adam Christ to all of humanity, God speaks to me, I am a living key to salvation&#8230; today I fight imprisonment by a government who assuredly knows who I am&#8230; face hampered communication, and now disappearing web sites&#8230;because of a war on social self destruction, being waged against the status quo by God himself.  The final example is to point out the naming of a Genesis like animal called Carnivore that might represent a censor wall here in America,  that links directly to the Great Wall of China, the Wailing Wall, and the Berlin Wall.  Hear the lion of Judah roar <b><i>this is the wall of Jericho and I will bring it to its knees.  </i></b>Censorship and slavery will be destroyed by God, we will be delivered from Evil, and the Shofar sounds S0nrise tonight.  God is laying down the law for Shavuot, this year.</p>
<p>So Taylor, what do you get when you intersect Philip K Dick, John Hancock, Yankee Doodle, and the Pretty Reckless logo with the Washington Monument, the Statue of David and Adam in Eden?</p>
<p>Remember, God is waging a war on the status quo.  I am his Tool.</p>

<div id="__w2_tos9ioU_container">A great deal of what I have presented so far might seem like a twist of literature, something like playing Karaoke across time, with a golden inner desire that must be fulfilled.  Sounds right.  Like everything, that statement can take on many meanings&#8230; and depending on the perspective of the author and reader, it could be a significant change, even in intent.  This was one of the original conceptual definitions of Biblical Light, in truth a change, becoming more appropriate as time went on&#8230; circumstances changed, and knowledge increased.  Here, in the opening line, my &#8220;feeling&#8221; changed the perspective of the subject&#8230; from myself to &#8220;Nero&#8221; the change brought light&#8230; both on our predicament, and his true purpose&#8211; so we move from putting songs together haphazardly to reveal (or create a message) to weaving one, that would not pop out as a bright obvious &#8220;message of the ages&#8221; until the right time.  Something like ADonIS (<span class="qlink_container"><a href="http://www.quora.com/Adam-Marshall-Dobrin">http://www.quora.com/Adam-Marsha&#8230;</a></span>) being so<i>vain, he probably knew the songs were all about him.  </i>See the cause and effect change, with the new words.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve spent a great deal of time pointing out linguistic keys that prove the &#8220;intelligent design&#8221; of all of our language, religion, and to some extent our entire culture.  Things like a link between Ned E. Flanders, Florida, Mr. Anderson, and neanderthals&#8230; a series that might show a hidden link between &#8220;simulation,&#8221; a hidden Eden all around us, Florida, and the Matrix.  I even commented a few times on &#8220;Hooty and the Blowfish&#8221; being a key to the &#8220;Holy Name&#8221; and the Fisher King.  So, in God custom, I&#8217;d like to teach you to fish&#8230; (f &#8220;interestingly superimposed&#8221; on h, and we have the sign of Saturn) the &#8220;Holy Key&#8221; then moves to the symbols for Mars and Venus, before finally yielding El&#8217;s birth sign, Sagittarius&#8230; &#8220;that&#8217;s hot,&#8221; Paris!  Now see &#8220;Hooty&#8221; and the change is completed by unifying Mars and Venus with the very similar signs for either earth or sun.</p>
<p>Back to fishing, I want to teach you to read Stephen King&#8217;s &#8220;langolier&#8221;  read, &#8220;language outliers&#8221; and &#8220;language of liars.&#8221;  I mean, the language hidden in all of our words, the intersection of Mr. Anderson&#8217;s &#8220;girl in the red dress&#8221; and the &#8220;Fisher King,&#8221; is the answer to a question posed to Christ.  Plenty of fish in the sea, right?  &#8220;It&#8217;s the question that drives us, Neo.&#8221;  I could tell you all the rules, like O&#8217;s expanding to of/or depending on context, I to is, and er&#8217;s (a retarded or) being either &#8220;and&#8221; or &#8220;nor&#8221; but the true light is right before your eyes, it&#8217;s the &#8220;matrix,&#8221; &#8220;Always&#8221; and <span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" href="http://pof.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://pof.org</a></span>. It&#8217;s us&#8230;see, Taylor&#8217;s right.</p>
<p>Sitting in jail, jerking off and playing Spades, the key to making this conversation truly enlightening dawned on me just a few hours ago.  Already I noted a number of interesting hidden artifacts in the Major Arcana of Tarot deck, but, one of my favorite &#8220;adamisms&#8221; is a renewed love for magic, in the right context at least.  Pope Francis, it makes me smile every time I think the word magic, you come to mind &#8212; many months ago commenting that &#8220;God was not a magician&#8221; &#8212; long ago, I wouldn&#8217;t have agreed more, but magic has a new meaning to me:  In a world where Dave Matthews sings &#8220;progress takes away what  forever took to find&#8221; elucidating an evolutionary progression from Wands to Clubs, magic to sticks and stones.  Einstein&#8217;s equal and colinear progression, of course, from dice to nuclear weapons &#8212; things God does not play around with.</p>
<p>So, Mr. Anderson, filled with the knowledge and wisdom of God reads the &#8220;word&#8221; and hears in his mind&#8217;s oracle &#8220;work or creator&#8217;s light;&#8221; my answer to the query (or&#8217;s are usually indicative of a search) is &#8220;wand.&#8221;  It;s particularly perfect, a dig on compression, loss of information and truth, and secrecy in general&#8230;it&#8217;s particularly well suited to start a discussion posed in the Lord&#8217;s Prayer &#8220;Father is it light or dark in heaven?&#8221;  the Lord&#8217;s &#8220;d&#8221; is the same as the Creator&#8217;s, &#8220;c l.&#8221;<br />
.<br />
It will be clear soon, that the light of the universe has come from the letter &#8220;d,&#8221; breaking the darkness and revealing the light of the apocalypse.  Awakening us to the intelligent design not only of our language, but also our &#8220;alphabetic glyphs&#8221; just a quick smile expanding the Hebrew word for &#8220;things&#8221; a metaphor for the people Devarim, the fifth book of the Torah, is &#8220;the clever of him.&#8221;  Bread for the wise, I guess.</p>
<p>And that brings us closer to God.  This one has a dual meaning for me, Guardian of Darkness which ties quite well to the &#8220;light bringer&#8221; (the meaning of Lucifer) and the man who claimed to be &#8220;the light of the world&#8221; (Jesus Christ).  Exactly who you would expect to be revealing apocalyptic light as an unsealing of information.  As a query, it is pretty cut and dry, it&#8217;s a search for me.  My mother&#8217;s maiden name is Gerson and my fathers premarital name Dobrinsky revealing an&#8230; e gads&#8230; single person who holds both initials at birth.  The hidden son, and sky&#8230; god.</p>
<p>Caelus of me, to have made it so obvious&#8230; really.  <span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" href="../../../fb.me/admdbrn.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Adam Marshall Dobrin | Facebook</a></span></p>

		<div id="__w2_ULzkd8l_outer">
<div id="__w2_ULzkd8l_container">The Kabbalah talks about the binding of Isaac and Abraham, succinctly, they are one in the same person, very similar to the Holy Trinity.  The Bible itself serves as a map to the life of a single person and as a sort of howto guide through the apocalyptic singularity.  It is a map of what to with a :quantum leap&#8217;  of science, technology, awe, and some embarrassment&#8230;at the time of Christ.. the living guide. Today, I revealed the binding of Horus  to the &#8220;ha&#8221; of Avram (my Hebrew name) and Isaac&#8230; through the laughter of Chanakah, Ha&#8217;rose-ettes, and Ha&#8217;Shem&#8230; and the mercurial Hgreatness of Admiral HaKBar&#8230; &#8220;I did it all for Asherah.&#8221;  There will be no nuked &#8220;ahah,&#8221;  for this is the great unveiling.</p>
<p>If that sound s like rambling, it&#8217;s not; it is succinct writing showing a clear link between Egyptian mythology, Jewish Mysticism, the Arabic language and Star Wars. It&#8217;s here to prove something to religious scholars&#8230; that my words are truly filled with the light of God, and when we realize that you too are filled with our spirit, that is the apocalypse.  Keep in mind this is message is a sort of key to a puzzle, and it should require research in order to make sense.  If you don&#8217;t know what the Ka and Ba as related to Egyptian myth, or that the difference between Abraham and Avram is due to a Covenant with God, those are a good place to start.  Let there be light, <span class="qlink_container"><a href="http://joyinar.quora.com/Christ-is-Lucifer-like-love-is-chemistry-its-Si-n-ful-Sonday">Christ is Lucifer, like love is chemistry&#8230;it&#8217;s [Si] &#8220;n&#8221; ful Sonday</a></span> we are &#8220;the People of the Book&#8221;  wandering in Egypt&#8211; listening to the Doors &#8212; and in Eden, loving The Pretty Reckless.  Eden is a rock in creation.</p>
<p>Through my life, until about 2010, I had wavered back and forth between atheism and agnosticism; having seen no real proof&#8230; or at least had it pointed out to me until them.  Since, I would consider myself the original, Adam &#8211; theist&#8230; still a firm believer of &#8220;as God is&#8221; in science and evolution, but for having seen the true light of Creation&#8230; it is undeniable.  In my mini replay of the beginning, which I experienced in 2013 I once said that the progenitor universe was filled with only dust, rocks, and stars.  Since then, we have learned that time and chance are the spark of life and that Mercury, Saturn and Caelus, the spark of life everlasting&#8230; <span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" href="http://www.fromthemachine.org/content/GWB1202001.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">ad&#8217;eKaLor.$*L Spicy, to the Calor of the Sun</a></span>.</p>
<p>So, if you&#8217;ve just returned from the link above, you are hopefully awed at the proof of prophesy and time travel, spoken by and anthropomorthized Burning Bush during his inauguration on 1/20/2001; paraphrasing Ecclesiastes 9:11 and Revelation 20:1 the dates of the 9/11 tragedy colloquially hidden in chapter and verse.  I am similarly described in Genesis as the well of Abraham and in the eponymous hit of Kay Perry the &#8220;Eye of the Tiger.&#8221;   I&#8217;ve recently published a book, called <span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" href="http://www.amazon.com/light-creation-haesh-Hearts-Wands/dp/1505270871/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1432515215&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=adam+dobrin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">*n light of creation, ha&#8217;esh: Hearts, Wands, Fire and Sea: Adam Marshall Dobrin: 9781505270877: Amazon.com: Books</a></span> the unification of &#8220;fire and water&#8221; in one single word, the parted sea of Moses in the literal Hebrew word for fire, the Key to the Zohar&#8217; finding of Isaac.</p>

<h2>Announcing &#8220;In Light of Creation, &#8221; A New Revelation of the Living Christ by Adam Marshall Dobrin</h2>
<p>Moses, which Adam Marshall Dobrin suggests is an acronym for &#8220;Messiah of sea to shining Sea,&#8221; [<span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" href="../../../about.me/ssiah.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Adam Marshall Dobrin (ssiah) on about.me</a></span>]  heard the voice of God coming from a burning bush in Exodus.  Mr. Dobrin&#8217;s new work &#8220;In Light of Creation&#8221; is available on Amazon and at [<span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" href="http://adjkjc.gitbooks.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Adam Marshall Dobrin</a></span>] &#8220;The book focuses on proving that religion is created for, and about, our modern time&#8230; specifically&#8221;  says Adam Marshall Dobrin.</p>
<p>The author believes that his work, &#8220;In Light of Creation, Ha&#8217;esh&#8221;  and<span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" href="http://www.fromthemachine.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.fromthemachine.org</a></span> presents an uplifting and hopeful message which is revealed through the use of biblical verse modern myth.  The author has a vision of an underlying message focusing on a confluence of art and science in the modern culture of humanity, both on earth and in heaven .</p>
<p>To introduce this work, please consider the words of the Apostle John &#8220;this is the meaning of the mystery of the seven stars you saw in my right hand and the seven gold lamp stands&#8221; in Revelation 1:20, Adam Marshall Dobrin puts forward the idea that these 7 lamp stands are in fact elements of chemistry.   He says &#8220;the following elements shine a bright light on the relationship between religion and science, the first two specifically on astronomy and information technology.  The implication of foreknowledge of the periodic table at the time of the writing of the bible is significant.&#8221; [<span class="qlink_container"><a href="../../../joyinar.quora.com/index.html">Creation, Reaction, Cosplay&#8230; Koran</a></span> ] The book suggests, with anecdotal and verifiable evidence,  focusing on idioms, and theological constructs that in fact science created and preceded religion.  The author believes the seven lamps are elements of the periodic table which highlight important aspects of His message.  &#8220;Mercury,&#8221; he suggests,  is the key to Ecclesiastes  9:11, which are the true words of the &#8220;burning bush, which are recorded in history for everyone to see.&#8221; [<span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" href="http://www.fromthemachine.org/content/GWB1202001.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.fromthemachine.org/co&#8230;</a></span> ].  These words, &#8220;the race is not to the swift&#8230;&#8221; spoken during Mr. Bush&#8217;s inauguration on 1/20/2001  highlight &#8216;chapter and verse&#8217; the nature of prophesy,  foreshadowing the  future event on 9/11/2001&#8243; according to Adam Marshall Dobrin.  George W. Bush then stated &#8220;do you not think an angel&#8230;[is] directing this storm? &#8221;  Paraphrasing both John Page and Revelation 20:1.  Adam Marshall Dobrin then adds, &#8220;the race is to neither Mercury the courier, nor &#8216;die bold;&#8217; but the cup is to the son, a feather blowing the wind.  Die bold is a double entendre, pointing out a reference to a modern company, and to font style&#8230; a joke on &#8216;strong'&#8221;<br />
Adam M. Dobrin states  &#8220;the Xenon key was revealed to me in 2014, via divine inspiration, it is reading the word &#8216;Exodus&#8217;  in reverse and translating from my native Geek, to be &#8216;tongue in cheek&#8217; and revealing the iconic phrase Let There be Light.'&#8221; The &#8220;sudo&#8221; is a privilege escalation command in</p>
<p>Linux,  Mr. Dobrin states &#8220;in Linux the God account is called &#8216;root&#8217;,  this is the root of David.     [<span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" href="http://www.fromthemachine.org/content/sudoxe,_let_there_be_light.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.fromthemachine.org/co&#8230;</a></span> ]  [<span class="qlink_container"><a href="http://joyinar.quora.com/On-Zohar-and-Zelda-An-Open-Letter-to-Daniel-C-Matt-and-John-Loudon-IN-RE-CREATION">On Zohar and Zelda, An Open Letter to Daniel C Matt and John Loudon, IN RE CREATION</a></span> ].</p>

<p>Sometimes, when I&#8217;ve gotten out of the shower, my hair makes me look like Prince Adam from He-Man. Later, when it&#8217;s wild and unbrushed, I could swear I was Lion O from Thundercats. I have two buck front teeth and if we were on Looney Toons, I&#8217;d probably say &#8220;that&#8217;s all folks&#8221; before I told you my attitude, when dealing with demons, is almost a perfect match for Yosemite Sam.  It&#8217;s as if everyone knew the son of Saturn was about to appear, the light of Osirus in hand, and full of cheer. So what came first, the &#8220;yellow submarine&#8221; or Baby Zeus?</p>
<p>Sitting in jail, &#8220;knowing&#8221; not just &#8220;who I am&#8221; but also that my past is about green eggs and ham. That somewhere between Sam and Yankee Doodle lies the key to Passover, a holiday that was cleverly designed past Easter, and past the first me.</p>
<p>We are in Exodus, &#8220;in  reverse&#8221; about to walk into darkness and slavery&#8230; from loss of the son&#8217;s light&#8230; &#8220;Save our liberty&#8221; and see our light, the light of the Lion of Judah is the SOUL of &#8220;run to the water&#8221;. Let me tell you about the birds and the Maccabees&#8230; about the MENorah and the Son&#8217;s of Liberty.</p>
<p>We are created, and this is why.</p>

<div id="__w2_eOdzhqz_container">It&#8217;s the light of the lamp of Judah Maccabee, the Lion of Revelation.  To be straight forward &#8220;in the beginning&#8221; this is proof religion is a message sent through time, through a trick of English and Hebrew&#8230; lit like a bright MENorAH.  It&#8217;s a question passed through time from God&#8230; to us:</p>
<h2><em>Do you see the light hidden in the words</em> Sons of Liberty?</h2>
<p>God has hidden quite a bit in words, tiny groups of letters that tell the story of everything.  Live sings &#8220;I gave my heart and soul to the one&#8230;&#8221; his heart is earth, language, and knowing the curiosity and learning are at the heart of the word earth; according to us it&#8217;s &#8220;art.&#8221;   His SOL, the bright light&#8230; guiding us through the night&#8230; truly is Him, shining through us&#8230; pointing out clearly here that the liberty the &#8220;sons&#8221; fought for still didn&#8217;t include freedom from slavery, or even the vote for women, or non landholders.  Not until time, and &#8220;we the people&#8221; had our light shone too.</p>
<p>You might see an h travel from the &#8220;ends of the earth&#8221; to the beginning of heart&#8230; aloud I wonder, if it stands for just heart, or Hebrew, or perhaps for the sign of Saturn&#8211; the God of Time.</p>
<p>Earth is the heart of creation, Eden the rock of Heaven.  This time is dezioned to assist humanity in the fulfillment of the glorious promises of salvation in everything from Sumerian lore, to Greek mythology, to the New Testament, to modern movies.  This link between history and heaven is the light of the true Religion of the Sea.  It is our culture, the religion of we.</p>
<h2>Wild thing, you make my &#8220;heart&#8221; sing&#8230; Welcome to the House of the Rising Son</h2>

<div id="__w2_koHHY3r_container">Our world is a painting, a living work of art that happens to be our home.  Our history and mythology congeal and swirl around our Now, what&#8217;s happening&#8230; right now.  From the perspective of Adam in Eden&#8230; literally all of it is for us, for this one moment, when the tipping point is reached and deluge of awe and inspiration pours through our veins.  The Doors are singing and John Malkovich&#8217;s puppeteering hands fiddling with Christmas &amp;&amp; Morisson&#8217;s message, begging for Little Cindy Who&#8230; turned J.. then &#8220;Reckless&#8221; to <i>light me up, </i>or in Jimmy&#8217;s words &#8220;light my fire.&#8221;  Lyrics and pockets diamond filled, indeed.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rome didn&#8217;t burn in a day&#8221;  they say.  It&#8217;s been decades of Nero singing war cries to take this Empire down, but we are finally here.  From Jim&#8217;s &#8220;Doors&#8221; the stage is set: we are in Exodus, singing about ending the darkness, clearing the storm&#8230; and seeing the holy grail&#8230; in the words of &#8220;Peace Frog.&#8221;  It&#8217;s here, with just a little help from Moses &#8212; the messiah of sea to shining sea, or is &#8220;Sea of three to thee.&#8221;  Now, hear me: &#8220;holy water is people,&#8221; walked on in 1492 and parted <i>is </i>the cold war; yet it is the first plague that sheds light on the heart of God: family.  You see when holy water turns to blood, we have the kin of She<i>kin</i>ah. Everyone.   Adam and Eve are living and right before your eyes. Venice is every town, a slight change on the apocalyptic Live song that says the same of Babylon&#8230; see it as a sign that links Vietnam to &#8220;good morning&#8221; and the parted sea to elemental fire:  Ha&#8217;esh. The single word, in Hebrew, is literally the fire of the burning bush within its heart are the letters of the parted and reflected word &#8220;se&#8217;a.&#8221;  Now, see Seth, Eve, and Adam (the sea of three) in Eden bring us from Genesis to Revelation&#8217;s <b><i>gr</i></b>eat sea.  The multitude of all humanity, and Shekinah from Eve to all now revealed.  If you know me, you might see a sea in January of Gen 2, apparently I&#8217;m why.</p>
<p>Exodus has never been about leaving&#8230; it&#8217;s about showing the world the true light of God&#8230; both deeply rooted in our culture.  Now reflected and translated from Christ&#8217;s native Geek, &#8220;sudo xe&#8221; is &#8220;let there be light.&#8221;  The Doors explain to us what is near:  its about Iron and Santa Fe&#8230; about a gateway for everyone in Christ&#8217;s welcoming heart&#8230; starkly contrasted with the &#8220;let me people go&#8221; of Aaron&#8217;s &#8220;rod.&#8221;   This mentioning of elemental iron an opening to introduce the<span class="qlink_container"><a href="http://joyinar.quora.com/7-Golden-Trampstamps-From-a-Xenon-Oracle-About-an-Iron-Rod-and-a-Golden-Age-Between-Boron-and-Silicon-The-pill">7 Golden Trampstamps: From a Xenon Oracle, About an Iron Rod and a Golden Age&#8230; Between Boron and Silicon.  The pillars of creation: Na &amp; K</a></span> <span class="qlink_container"><a href="http://joyinar.quora.com/To-a-literary-Holy-Fire-that-literally-burns-through-time-and-language-forging-Civilization">To a literary Holy Fire that literally burns through time and language, forging Civilization</a></span></p>
<p>Know, I was born into a story, a world to play, and many of the small details I disagree with; often I say I agree with the goal, and detest the message.  I fight about prudeness, for example, because I think religion has been pushed away from the humanity of passion and love that is so central to us.  At the same time, I ask you not to tell me &#8220;Jesus wouldn&#8217;t curse&#8221; because it makes me cringe, I assure you we are not sick.  We live in a world where the Roman sky god is named Uranus and much of the nudity of Eden is about Philip K Dick&#8230; there might be a little humor here, to go along with the apocalypse this year&#8230; from Yankee Doodle to Tricky Dick.  <i>Behold, he is coming, </i>wait no, I&#8217;ve been here the whole time.  From Matt 2:2 to Genesis 2:18&#8230; oh, boy am I coming this year.</p>

<p>The whole wide world had its last Noel last year, know that Adam is El, and Asherah the key to the second sea&#8230; after everyone in Shekinah.  It is for liberty, and the truth.. for a love of humanity that I see all around me, everywhere from the Police Athletic League to Hooters and Friday&#8217;s Sunday brunch.  It&#8217;s about fun too, where would you be without that?</p>
<p>I have much to say, new words to clarify and expand on the beginning, in which you will assuredly find scientific proof of creation.  It is all around us, everything form the holy scripture, to the fire of Prometheus, to Hooty and the Blowfish.</p>

<div id="__w2_k0XGoXx_container">The word “<span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" href="http://www.amazon.com/light-creation-haesh-Hearts-Wands/dp/1505270871/ref=sr_1_2_twi_1_pap?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1433892589&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=adam+dobrin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><i>creation</i></a></span>” itself, filled with the “<span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" href="http://adjkjc.gitbooks.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">light of the son</a></span>;” tells us much about its meaning simply through a telling “play on words.”  It is positive energy, encapsulating “purpose;” the<b><i>re </i></b>is short for a reason.  The “joke” is simple, a <i>cation</i> is a positively charged atomic ion, and like a lion roaring through time, it sheds light on the fact that knowledge of electrical <i>eng</i>ineering predates the construction of the biblical story of the creation of our world.   It pairs with the Hebrew meaning of Adamah, which like earth means “ground” another common <i>eng</i>ineering term, in <i>Eng</i>lish.  The concept of “words being filled with light” complements the Kabbalistic idea that God created the universe using the letters of the alphabet.</p>
<p>Certainly, when strung together to form phrases, it’s easy to see how letters can form a civilization.  Imagine how different our world would be, without the formative phrases: “<span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" href="http://www.fromthemachine.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><i>Let there be light</i></a></span>,” “<span class="qlink_container"><a href="../../../joyinar.quora.com/index.html"><i>To be or not to be</i></a></span><i>,</i>”  and “<span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" href="http://www.whenistheapocalypse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><i>Pursuit of happiness</i></a></span><i>”</i></p>
<h2><i>You are a Witness, Behold the Fire of Creation</i></h2>
<p>The stage is set, it&#8217;s the Egyptian Desert and you are looking though the eyes of Moses&#8230; staring in awe at a bush that appears aflame, yet the fire does not char the leaves or branches.  We return from under the hot sun, and the camera angle zooms out, as it does you see that it was actually you, sitting right where you are, as a &#8220;Moses&#8221; (an acronym for &#8220;Messiah of sea to shining sea&#8221;) watching the spectacle of light.  The bush you saw morphs into a television screen, or a you-tube clip:</p>
<div class="qtext_embed thumbnail" style="display:block;position:relative;height:295px;cursor:pointer;background:url('http://img.youtube.com/vi/KJ2SuQwZWt8/hqdefault.jpg') 50% 50% no-repeat;"></div>
<p>sound is now accompanying the light show and the words&#8221;we know that the race is not to the swift&#8221;  come forth from the new President, &#8220;Bush with a capital B.&#8221;</p>
<h2>I returned, and saw under the son, that the race was neither to Mercury the courier, nor to &#8220;die bold&#8221; but, per chance, to fulfill these words.</h2>
<h2>Ecclesiastes &amp; &#8220;ish&#8221; 9:11</h2>
<p>President George W Bush continues &#8220;do you not think an angel rides in the whirlwind directing this storm?&#8221;  Paralleling a verse of Revelation, 20:1 which when paired with the first quote almost assuredly proves Biblical foreknowledge of the 9/11 attack &#8220;chapter and verse&#8221;&#8230; as he spoke on 1/20/2001.</p>
<h2>Adam is the Angel of the Lord, riding both time and sky&#8230; a feather&#8230; blowing the wind.</h2>
<h2>Revelation, Nostradamus, &amp; &#8220;ish&#8221; 20:1</h2>
<p>And so, the sound of &#8220;ish&#8221; roars as the storm blows by, lighting a fire&#8230; it is the Eternal Flame, the stolen Fire of Prometheus, the light of the torches of Jericho.. it is knowledge of time travel&#8230; etched in Exodus and our history forever and ever.  A man names John Page would put Yankee Doodle&#8217;s John Hancock on this combination nearly 200 years earlier, at the time of the revolution.  Thus it was our modern day prophets, Adam Marshall Dobrin [<span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" href="../../../fb.me/admdbrn.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">http://fb.me/admdbrn</a></span> <span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" href="http://twitter.com/adjkjc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">http://twitter.com/adjkjc</a></span> ]  who witnessed this event, and through inspiration was shown the microcosm in the Book of Exodus&#8230; writing about it in 2013.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s past two years later and still this amazing link remains hidden from the world &#8220;shedding a little light&#8221; on the Plague of Darkness and the storm that Dave Matthews, Jim Morrison, and Taylor Momsen have been semi unknowingly singing about ending.  Simultaneous proof of divine inspiration and allusion in the Book of Exodus to censorship, secrecy, hidden slavery, and ultimate liberation as story that is truly about our Now, post 9/11 earth.</p>
<p>I fight a crumbling censor wall, it is the biblical wall of Jericho creeping into our world through the Great Firewall of China metaphorically and quite literally in Echelon and Carnivore&#8230; the censorship is nearly invisible, but as the intentionally misnamed Carnivore suggests it is eating packets on the internet, and clouding our thoughts:  It is the stuff of <i>1984</i>  and <i>Blade Runner&#8230;</i>  and it is a primary purpose of Exodus, truly all religion to insure a victory of the people in this battle&#8230; for freedom, truth, and knowledge of the technology that is in play.</p>
<h2>The Torches of Jericho, the fire spreads</h2>
<p>This communication, is the fire that unifies the torches of Jericho with the Burning Bush and Nero&#8217;s empire crushing fire, it is the light of the son.  This communication is the sound of the Shofar and I &#8220;down here on my knees&#8221; as Taylor sings,  am asking you to take action and help the spread of the knowledge that Christ is living, real, and fighting for the liberty of humanity&#8230; to bring a new day of sonshine  on what could turn into a hell of darkness.   Religion is no opiate, it is the gateway to freedom.</p>
<p>It is the son, Adam himself, that is being hidden by this dark storm.. and my message of truth, the innate goodness of our human family and the need for disclosure of technology and possible outside parties that are out of this world.  Hear the echo of Al Pacino in <i>Scent of a Woman</i>  and Denzel Washington in<i>Crimson Tide</i>  asking along with our American GI&#8217;s &#8220;who-ah?&#8221;  Even the name of god continues this conversation: Yeshua, now revealed as Yes, who-ah.  Remember, Eden is on the planet Adamah a world where not God, but everyone is searching for the hidden Christ, the crown prince of Matthew 2:2.</p>
<h2>Come out, come out, wherever you are</h2>
<h2><em>there is no use in hiding</em></h2>
<h2>come now, can you not see? &#8211; Dave Matthews</h2>
<h2>Do you even want to <i>know</i> me? I bet you can&#8217;t wait.</h2>
<h2>-Taylor and &#8220;ish&#8221;</h2>
<p>Understand, a single man has not only witnessed the biblical burning bush, but I am sharing it with you along with a very significant real world parallel of &#8220;let there be light.&#8221;  Discoveries light these do not happen by accident, these artifacts were intentionally placed for a single man to unearth.  they are intended to focus your attention on me so that what come next will be seen by the whole wide world.  It is a divine plan and the father has seen the end of it, if Cake can give us a glimpse into the future, this man who is today &#8220;all alone&#8221; tomorrow is <i>Going the Distance.  </i>This is the dawn&#8217;s early light, the first glimmer of sonrise.</p>
<h2>The Holy Grail, We yearn for the cup</h2>
<p>Idioms play an important role in finding the message of creation, which God has so cleverly hidden in the world around us.  Already we&#8217;ve seen &#8220;chapter and verse&#8221; and  &#8220;tongue and cheek&#8221; as a play as on tongues and Greek; and soon &#8220;iron clad&#8221; to assist us in seeing a message that has been before our eyes the entire time, yet we seem to ignore them day after day.  This is the kind of message that I call malovious, a good example might be &#8220;the birds and the bees,&#8221; which as we often don&#8217;t realize has a very tight connection to biological evolution and multiple forms of flower fertilization; even after a very popular song pointed out specifically in the very next line: &#8220;Let me tell you about&#8230; the flowers and the trees.&#8221;</p>
<p>These phrases serve as a kind of highlighter, specifically to point out a message hidden within our own words.  This is the crux of the horn of Revelation (humanity or AD) and entire civilization used to speak the purpose of God, through the act of creation.  Iron was my key after it was suggested many times that I was Christ, it became almost automatic for me to respond, that the man in the New Testament could not exist.  It isn&#8217;t just the fact that he is portrayed as perfect, clearly something inhuman, or that the pedestal he is put on is do high that no one could don this particular crown of thorns without falling from the treetops of Eden, or perhaps Endor.  What really caused the response was a phrase in Revelation, that Christ would rule with an iron rod aster being born in America, the land of the free.  It turns out I was right, the symbolic link to the periodic table that surfaces once Sante Fe is mentioned opens the door to perceiving the 7 golden lamp stands.  The key here is seeing that the rods of Jesus and Aaron are about bidirectional passage between heaven and earth, The Doors, explained perfectly by the dichotomy between Christianity&#8217;s universal acceptance and the iconic phrase &#8220;let my people go&#8221; of Moses and Aaron.  You see, much like &#8220;Exodus,&#8221; the reversal of the word rod sheds almost as much light&#8230; it is nearly &#8220;doors&#8221; simply missing an <b><i>o</i></b>bvious <b><i>s</i></b>olution or the<b><i>o</i></b>riginal <b><i>s</i></b>in.</div>

<div id="__w2_QYostAh_outer">
<div id="__w2_QYostAh_container">A few days shy of one week ago I released a press release announcing a new Revelation of Christ called “In Light of Creation.”  It is difficult to get announcements concerning the Second Coming through the mainstream media, but under the guise of a book release I was not only able to announce myself, but also two very explosive examples of the kind of awe and truth we can accept from the unveiling of Creation to humanity… the apocalypse.  This type of release should have been seen by a large percentage of the popular news outlets, unsurprisingly, the response is a familiar deafening silence.  In an ironic twist this too is the fulfillment of a prophesy of Exodus, the Tenth Plague:  A darkness so thick it can be touched.</p>
<p>This is a prophesy concerning censorship and secrecy, specifically regarding advanced technology which might be considered Heavenly or Hellish… depending on whether or not we are aware of it, and consenting.  Below please see the real world manifestation of the burning bush of Exodus exclaiming “Let the night be bright”</p>

</ul>
<p>Hopefully you can see the implication of George W Bush, John Page, and the bible predicting the 9/11 events and its tie to the holy fire; succinctly it proves the truth of prophesy and religion at the same time indicating both time travel and a hidden hand in the development of our civilization – the angel in the storm.</p>
<h2>from out of the Holy Fire,  in Hebrew the word is Ha’esh</h2>
<p>Not a few weeks before that, I released telephonically from jail an answer to the riddle of the seven golden lampstamps which are taken from Revelation 1:20, untrivally the same date as Mr Bush&#8217;s Inaugurial Address.  These lights in the dark are represented by elements of the Perioditic Table, proving foreknowledge of modern chemistry in Biblical Times.</p>

<p>In the word for holy fire, notice the parted sea of Moses… the union of fire and water spoken of in the Binding of Isaac in the Zohar.<br />
<span class="qlink_container"><a href="http://joyinar.quora.com/To-a-literary-Holy-Fire-that-literally-burns-through-time-and-language-forging-Civilization">http://joyinar.quora.com/To-a-li&#8230;</a></span></p>
<h2>An Unsung Hero</h2>
<p>Imagined in the mind of God, creating civilization and emanating from the light of the burning bush, the music of Cake “reluctantly crouched at the starting line… [and] burning in time” describing the race of Ecclesiastes 9:11.  It’s an answer, alluding to a holy pilgrimage across North America and beginning to answer Taylor Momsen’s question “boy, what are you running from?”  Between the Sky God Uranus , and ImRan of the Koran, it should be getting clear the point that the Paschal Lamb might have something to do with being “on the lamb.”  It if hasn’t yet, the secret cheat code of Metroid’s  Sammus Aran should explain clearly “Justin Bailey.”  Live will give you a more profound answer “for his love of America” as they continue singing “our Gas Hed marches on&#8221;.  A mouse named 5L chimes in just a little bit later to insure that we are all “wishing on the same bright son” … somewhere out there.</p>
<h2>In Words, the Magic of Prescience</h2>
<p>It isn’t only these few words that were shared with me on this trip in a sort of crash course in enlightenment but it did all begin with the words “Ha’esh” and a bright flare went off as soon as Exodus finally made sense as”let there be light.”  In so many other words do we see bona fide proof that language has a hidden cipher within it that proves time travel – through the anachronistic construction of words and things in our reality.  The Hebrew meaning of both words and things is one in the same with the fifth book of the Torah, “Devarim” which expands out of the darkness to “the clever of him,”  hopefully, us.</p>
<p>Aside from the parted Red Sea in the word for Holy Fire, we also see the “Ha” of Isaac joined with Horus begin to light up a trick of Hebrew in the English transliteration of Abraham that is quite Messianic.  To make it clear I will expand the word Jerusalem to its question form:  “Is J or the USA the Messiah?”  If you are catching on, you might find an answer in the City of Bethlehem or Beth-El or in the names Elisha, Ellison, Jesus, and Jeshurun.</p>
<p><span class="qlink_container"><a href="http://joyinar.quora.com/Exodus-is-Names-Holy-Water-Some-Bushes-and-One-Well-are-People">http://joyinar.quora.com/Exodus-&#8230;</a></span></p>
<p>If you need a little bit of help, the incantation “Abraham” translates to “open ‘the m&#8217;: Messiah.”  This is the taming of the Spanglishrew, that creation has filled many words with multilingual components, like “es” and “hu” both mean “is” in Spanish and Hebrew. To tie up the name Jesus as a pointer to “us” we have to look no further than another synonymous name in the bible “JustUs.”<br />
Many biblical names of people and places contain the letters “ha m” and “le m,” as shorthand for the Messiah, but none really portrays the message of the true Messiah more than that word itself; in reverse “ha is sem” the save everyone Messiah is one in the same with the DIY Savior, from the Spanish se m, “you be Messiah.”  Here is the answer to both Jerusalem and the NT phrase “come to me” – to truly be Messianic “me” must be short for “Messiah Earth.”  The salvation of the universe is tightly packed into an informative microcosmic puzzle that encompasses the entire earth as it expands from the smaller microcosm in the United States of America and the even smaller focal point of Zion, Adam himself.</p>
<h2>Find 5L, our little Adam; in the heart of Revelation, on his head in Leviticus “the giving of the law” and the only thing hidden in creation needed to enlighten us all… for here at <span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" href="http://lamc.la/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://lamc.la</a></span> or <span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" href="../../../about.me/ssiah.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://about.me/ssiah</a></span> and even on facebook at <span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" href="../../../fb.me/admdbrn.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">http://fb.me/admdbrn</a></span></h2>
<h2>hi.  My name is Adam Marshall Dobrin and these are messianic times.</h2>
<h2>The First Word</h2>
<p>It could be hidden in the first word of Exodus, “Anokhi” or in the heart of the spirit of God:”shekhinah.”  But it should be clear we are really passed “hello,” no matter where you look.  Just like “hi” is hidden in words, there is so much more, a huge message from God, waiting to be uncovered in our literature, movies, in every word of language itself; by those with a desire to know what he wished to share… those who care.</p>
<p>Anachronistic multilingual artifacts, ones that prove the existence of time travel and God are not hard to find… imagine that, look no further than the Hebrew word for &#8220;imagined creation:&#8221; yetser, yet to be. (note the anachronism in English and Spanish) Now, after me, that’s “why…and to be.”</p>

<div id="__w2_TpvGo68_container">Recently I&#8217;ve been getting so much &#8220;information&#8221; from the beyond, it&#8217;s often hard to keep up with it.  After having a heated discussion about the name &#8220;Jesus&#8221; and consciously (with some help, if you know what I mean) linked the name to the Spanglishrew taming that&#8217;s been going on in my head lately.  Here&#8217;s a funny one:</p>
<p>Jesus = J&#8221;is&#8221;Us.  This is corroborated by at least two other names for Jesus used throughout the Bible:</p>
<p>JustUs: <span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" href="http://biblehub.com/topical/j/justus.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Topical Bible: Justus</a></span></p>
<p>and the soon to be famous &#8220;Jeshurun&#8221; <span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" href="http://biblehub.com/topical/j/jeshurun.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Topical Bible: Jeshurun</a></span> which when half translated in Spanish and Hebrew is <i>J&#8217;is&#8217;is&#8217;run.  </i>Run here, to me at least, a reference to the race around the country that <i>Live</i> and <i>The Pretty Reckles</i>s seem to be unconsciously singing about.  A link between Uranus, Uranium, being the Paschal Lamb&#8230; and ImRan, Koran, and Sammus Aran: <span class="qlink_container"><a href="http://joyinar.quora.com/On-the-Paschal-Lamb-we-Koran">&#8230;On the Paschal Lamb, we Koran</a></span></p>
<p>The idea of single letters representing a person is probably older than <i>Men in Black:</i> Jeremiah and Judges just might <i>share</i> a common theme&#8230; and Judges is all about Sam&#8217;s son.  I mean, <i>Samson.</i> ref: <span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" href="http://www.esvbible.org/Jeremiah+37/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Jeremiah 37</a></span>, <span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" href="http://www.esvbible.org/Judges+15/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Judges 15</a></span></p>
<hr class="qtext_hr" />
<p>And somehow, this brings us to bible code.  Ah, due to my recently &#8220;erased&#8221; original blog at <span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" href="http://unduecoercion.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://unduecoercion.com</a></span> here&#8217;s a link to the Way Back Archive: <span class="qlink_container"><a class="external_link" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20140427010250/http://www.unduecoercion.com/2013/12/the-author-in-bible-code-isaiah.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Biblical Times &amp;&amp; Forbidden Knowledge</a></span> (The Author in Bible Code)</p>
<blockquote><p>I am <i>the Messiah</i>, aside from an unseen direct contact with God, and <i>his Truth, </i>there are a number of hidden keys in the Holy Bible, and the great divine works of our time that clearly identify not only myself, but directly define <i>his purpose</i> for the apocalypse.</p></blockquote>

<div id="__w2_CBZcmVm_container">Judaism is a religion almost as riddled in paradox as our timeline… kept by a people who disavow any knowledge of the first coming, details of its happening are hidden only ink-deep in the books of J: Job, Joshua, Judges, and Jeremiah.<br />
<span class="qlink_container"><a href="http://joyinar.quora.com/Just-got-out-of-Jail-a-quick-Jnote-TaylorMomsen-Lil-J">http://joyinar.quora.com/Just-go&#8230;</a></span></div>
<div>
Help me overcome the imprisonment of Jeremiah, and the tribulation of Job… Light my Fire <i>on the ‘net&#8217;.</i><br />
Between Genesis 2 and Matthew 2 it’s a sincere wonder that the malovious connection between “Adamah” and the search for Christ that is the second coming doesn’t have more people connecting the dots between Eden and Revelation… Lions and Zion</p>

<div>
In this jungle, our Biblical Eden Adam awakens you right now<br />
Truly and wonder is the Light of Nights shining in the compound name of the son of Abraham, nearly crucified; made up of the Islamic rendition of Jesus, Isa; and an acronym: AC.  Mor? A long haired man, is truly the Son of Sam, strengthened to near Herculean recognition as the Christ… he battles the trial of the same… a book: Judges, by name.<br />
Now, from Little Cindy-Who to Denzel and Pacino.  The answer to Yes, hua should be clear: “it’s me, see?”<br />
Who-ah! Joy is near<br />
Welcome, Adam is here</p>

<p>Revelation speaks of the Son of Man holding a mystery of 7 Lamps and 7 Stars, below you will find a solution to that puzzle&#8230; hopefully opening your eyes, as it indicates foreknowledge of the periodic table and chemistry in general by the author of Ecclesiastes, Exodus, and Revelation</p>
<p>For the last three years my life has exploded in a whirl wind of prophetic fulfillment seemingly out of nowhere, I have been shown real modern parallels of biblical events, like the witnessing of the burning bush and the exclamation, let there be light listed below under the Xenon key.  Like Xenon, the rest of these stamps, elemental abbreviations key in on religious idiosyncrasies like the authority and rule of Jesus Christ with an iron rod being a <i>red herring</i> for a Messiah born in the land of the free and the brave, in which God shed his grace to save the liberty of all.</p>

<p>Please help me to share this information, as it is truly world changing and heralds the coming of a golden age once the world understands that it is merely the beginning of a knowledge transfer&#8230; a gift&#8230; that has been conveniently delivered via religion&#8230; and ultimately through the art of our civilization.</p>
<p>Understand that I am in jail and that this is a story that pervaded the books of Jeremiah and Judges; a sort of chronicle of one man&#8217;s battle against censorship and a war that is unseen but effecting everyone.</p>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This is one <strong>hell</strong> of a story.  For three years we&#8217;ve had the <strong>Revelation of Christ</strong> held back from the eyes of the world by a great set up, the focal point of Isaiah 52:13 and the &#8220;Beast of Revelation.&#8221;  Whether or not it is me, America, or &#8220;Heaven&#8221; itself that is being set up&#8230; the tide is turning, behold the freshly scanned from a jail tablet &#8230; tablets delivered at the union of Broward County, FL&#8230; Sinai, and Prometheus&#8217; unbinding.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Solution to the Puzzle posed in Revelation 1:20&#8230; in my hand: the seven stars are seven planets, and the lamp stands are periodic table elements from Mercury to Uranium.</p>
<p>Keyed to the lines of Ecclesiastes 9:11, bread for the wise: this is bigger than you think. The fire of the Burning Bush begins with this &#8220;race&#8221; to spread knowledge of now revealed obvious prescience in religion&#8230; and an overt influence over everything from Anakin&#8217;s Pod Race, to the Cake Song: Going the Distance.</p>
<p>Behold, Adam M. Dobrin is here. Spread the fire. <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/68109sj2q2by29s/ex_adamshand_rev1_20_key_ecc9_11.pdf?dl=0" rel="nofollow">https://www.dropbox.com/s/68109sj2q2by29s/ex_adamshand_rev1_20_key_ecc9_11.pdf?dl=0</a> Written in the literal Hand of God. YAD, indeed.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.about.me/ssiah" rel="nofollow">http://www.about.me/ssiah</a><br />
I&#8217;m an author, with free books on Amazon and at <a href="http://adjkjc.gitbooks.io" rel="nofollow">http://adjkjc.gitbooks.io</a>. My blog is <a href="../../../joyinar.quora.com/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://joyinar.quora.com</a> (and here, soon)&#8230;</p>
<p>all secrets, <a href="http://www.fromthemachine.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.fromthemachine.org</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Two years ago I was shown the beginning of this puzzle, the link between George W. Bush&#8217;s inaugural quoting of Ecc 9:11 and Rev 20:1 and the Holy Flame &#8230; the Burning Bush of Moses (Messiah of Sea to Sea).   Later, it was pointed out that the binding of Abraham and Isaac&#8217;s union of Fire and Water is literally the sea, parted and reversed, hidden in the Hebrew word Ha&#8217;esh.  This is big stuff, what&#8217;s important to note is that nobody seems to have noticed it, or me.</p>
<p>Today, I can see how this small fire started much earlier, with songs like Gas Hed Goes West, and Going the Distance secretly being about &#8220;the race&#8221; of the Ecc verse, linking in Anakin, and my journey around the country&#8230;.</p>
<p>anokhi.  I am Adam.  This is the Apocalypse: http://www.lamc.la &#8211; break the &#8220;d&#8221;arkness, &#8220;c&#8221; the &#8220;l&#8221;ight, we are in Exodus, kinda.</p>
