I'm going to run through all 32 teams and rank the work they did.</p><p>To measure how each team performed, I'm comparing their roster, cap situation and future draft capital at the beginning of the offseason to what they have in mid-May. The most important thing a team can do is add talent, so those that made significant inroads in improving their roster will rank highly, while those that saw key people leave without replacements won't. I also considered how each attacked their specific needs, how well they read the market and handled the financial side of their deals, and what they did to create future draft picks.</p><aside class="inline editorial float-r" data-behavior="article_related"><h1>Editor's Picks</h1><ul><li><a name="&lpos=story:editorspicks:inline:1" href="/nfl/insider/story/_/id/29189803/nfl-experts-debate-most-improved-teams-underrated-2020-moves-more" class="img-link"><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/photo/2020/0521/r701143_1296x1296_1-1.jpg&w=130&h=130&scale=crop&location=center"></a><h2><a name="&lpos=story:editorspicks:inline:1" href="/nfl/insider/story/_/id/29189803/nfl-experts-debate-most-improved-teams-underrated-2020-moves-more" class=" espnplus">NFL experts debate: Which team has declined most this offseason?</a></h2></li><li><a name="&lpos=story:editorspicks:inline:2" href="/nfl/insider/story/_/id/29166756/ranking-nfl-offseason-25-biggest-position-upgrades-brady-gronk-kicker" class="img-link"><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/photo/2016/0831/r120738_1296x1296_1-1.jpg&w=130&h=130&scale=crop&location=center"></a><h2><a name="&lpos=story:editorspicks:inline:2" href="/nfl/insider/story/_/id/29166756/ranking-nfl-offseason-25-biggest-position-upgrades-brady-gronk-kicker" class=" espnplus">Ranking the 25 biggest position upgrades of the NFL offseason</a></h2></li><li><a name="&lpos=story:editorspicks:inline:3" href="/nfl/story/_/id/29160784/2020-nfl-offseason-winners-losers-qbs-free-agents-teams-trends" class="img-link"><img src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/photo/2020/0511/r697624_1296x1296_1-1.jpg&w=130&h=130&scale=crop&location=center"></a><h2><a name="&lpos=story:editorspicks:inline:3" href="/nfl/story/_/id/29160784/2020-nfl-offseason-winners-losers-qbs-free-agents-teams-trends" class="">Barnwell: Picking 20 NFL offseason winners and losers, from Lock to Dak</a></h2></li></ul><div class="button button-alt sm btn-related">2 Related</div></aside><p>For each team, I'll include what went right, what went wrong, what they might have done differently with a bit of hindsight and what they need to do next in the months to come.

The Bucs added quarterback <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2330/tom-brady">Tom Brady</a> to replace <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2969939/jameis-winston">Jameis Winston</a>. Getting even a declining Brady would be enough to push them toward the top 10, but they followed up those moves by convincing tight end <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/13229/rob-gronkowski">Rob Gronkowski</a> to come out of retirement and acquiring him from the Patriots for a pick swap. With a huge hole looming at right tackle, they then managed to protect Brady by using their first-round pick on <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4240589/tristan-wirfs">Tristan Wirfs</a>.</p><p>You knew about all of that already, but lost in the shuffle was the work Tampa Bay did to retain the core of a defense that ranked fifth in DVOA a year ago. It managed to bring back tackle <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/13234/ndamukong-suh">Ndamukong Suh</a> and ends <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/13256/jason-pierre-paul">Jason Pierre-Paul</a> and <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16967/shaquil-barrett">Shaq Barrett</a>. The Bucs pressured opposing quarterbacks 34% of the time when all three of those players were on the field last season, which would have been the second-best mark in football over a full season.

You could make a case that they should have added a veteran running back, but they let <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3051902/peyton-barber">Peyton Barber</a> leave and only replaced him by drafting <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3917612/keshawn-vaughn">Ke'Shawn Vaughn</a> in the third round, suggesting 2018 second-round pick <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3912550/ronald-jones-ii">Ronald Jones</a> will have a big role.</p><p><b>What they could have done differently:</b> Brought back the Creamsicle jerseys. I can't think of any personnel decisions the Buccaneers should have handled differently this offseason. Even if Brady disappoints, there's no way they could or should have turned down the opportunity to add him.

The new brain trust hired Bill Callahan to take over the offensive line, entrusting the weakest part of the 2019 team to arguably the NFL's best offensive line coach.</p><p>After quarterback <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3052587/baker-mayfield">Baker Mayfield</a> was left shell-shocked by subpar offensive line play, the Browns signed the top lineman available, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2979534/jack-conklin">Jack Conklin</a>, and used their first-round pick on their left tackle of the future, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4241482/jedrick-wills-jr">Jedrick Wills Jr.</a> Finally, in an attempt to surround Mayfield with playmakers before a make-or-break season, the Browns signed <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3043275/austin-hooper">Austin Hooper</a> to serve as their primary tight end.

The former first overall pick has been a superstar from the moment he arrived in Cleveland, and he was on pace for a 16-sack, 29-knockdown campaign before being <a href="/nfl/story/_/id/28685713/nfl-reinstates-browns-myles-garrett-suspension">suspended</a> for striking <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3116407/mason-rudolph">Mason Rudolph</a> with a helmet.

The Broncos signed running back <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2576434/melvin-gordon">Melvin Gordon</a> in free agency, then used their first two picks on wide receivers <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4241463/jerry-jeudy">Jerry Jeudy</a> and <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4240380/kj-hamler">KJ Hamler</a>. They also upgraded their offensive line by signing <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2576245/graham-glasgow">Graham Glasgow</a> and got Lock an accomplished offensive coordinator in former Browns and Giants coach Pat Shurmur.</p><p>I liked what the Broncos did on defense too. Letting cornerback <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14398/chris-harris-jr">Chris Harris Jr.</a> leave, Elway traded a pair of picks for veteran corner <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16562/aj-bouye">A.J. Bouye</a> and lineman <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14047/jurrell-casey">Jurrell Casey</a>, with the latter being stolen away from a Titans team that needed the cash and cap room for a seventh-round pick. Denver waited out the market on tackle <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16837/shelby-harris">Shelby Harris</a> and was able to bring back the 2019 starter on a one-year, $3.1 million deal, far less than the figures Harris' camp was tossing around before free agency.</p><p><b>What went wrong:</b> Gordon can be a valuable player, but he has been too inconsistent to justify the two-year, $16 million deal he took home. The move could marginalize <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3052117/phillip-lindsay">Phillip Lindsay</a>, and I'm not sure Gordon is actually a better back than the former undrafted free agent. Elway also didn't find a challenger or replacement for embattled left tackle <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4035662/garett-bolles">Garett Bolles</a>, who has shown precious few signs of improvement as a pro while committing a staggering 34 holding penalties during the past three seasons, 15 more than any other player over that time frame.</p><p><b>What they could have done differently:</b> The Broncos could have waited out the perennially flooded running back market for a bargain. I suspect they could have signed someone like <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16944/devonta-freeman">Devonta Freeman</a> on a one-year deal for less than half of what they'll pay Gordon in 2020, and while Gordon is probably the better player, the difference isn't commensurate with the money involved.</p><p><a name="IND"></a></p><p><b>What's left to do:</b> Bring in a challenger for Bolles. There aren't many exciting options at left tackle available on the open market, but simply getting somebody who won't commit three holding penalties per month would be a step in the right direction for the Broncos. <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/6012/jason-peters">Jason Peters</a> might be out of their price range, but they could pretty easily justify signing someone like <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15035/kelvin-beachum">Kelvin Beachum</a> or <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14971/cordy-glenn">Cordy Glenn</a> to compete for the job.</p><hr><img alt="" class="floatleft" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/ind.png&h=110&w=110" width="31"><h2>4. <a href="/nfl/team/_/name/ind/indianapolis-colts">Indianapolis Colts</a></h2><p><b>What went right:</b> Indy upgraded at arguably the two most important positions on its roster.

Sacrificing the surplus value of the first-round pick and tacking it onto Buckner's contract means they realistically paid north of $25 million or so per season for the interior disrupter.

The offense will run it back with <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2576623/devante-parker">DeVante Parker</a>, <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/17177/allen-hurns">Allen Hurns</a>, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/17051/albert-wilson">Albert Wilson</a> and <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3915399/preston-williams">Preston Williams</a> at wideout and <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3116164/mike-gesicki">Mike Gesicki</a> at tight end. Parker finally had his breakout season, but after four middling years up to that point, is he a surefire No. 1 wide receiver? And even if he is, why not add more behind him with Williams and limited production from Hurns and Wilson a year ago? There's a good chance the Dolphins will be back in the receiver market next offseason.</p><p><b>What they could have done differently:</b> I would have tried to come away with at least one wide receiver from those five picks in the first or second round. And given what the Cardinals paid, I would have loved to see Miami top the offer and trade for <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15795/deandre-hopkins">DeAndre Hopkins</a> before making him Tagovailoa's new best friend. I can't fault the Dolphins for taking Igbinoghene at No. 30, but would they have been better off drafting <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4239993/tee-higgins">Tee Higgins</a> or <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4035687/michael-pittman-jr">Michael Pittman Jr.</a> while signing free-agent cornerback <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15861/logan-ryan">Logan Ryan</a>?</p><p><a name="ARI"></a></p><p><b>What's left to do:</b> Wait and see. I would suggest they take a run at defensive end <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16734/jadeveon-clowney">Jadeveon Clowney</a>, but after he turned down multiple opportunities to join Miami over the past year, the Dolphins might be ready to move on. Unless the opportunity to acquire a significant wide receiver arises, they really need to take this year and evaluate what's working in advance of a possible playoff push and a full season from Tagovailoa as their starter in 2021.</p><hr><img alt="" class="floatleft" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/ari.png&h=110&w=110" width="31"><h2>8. <a href="/nfl/team/_/name/ari/arizona-cardinals">Arizona Cardinals</a></h2><p><b>What went right:</b> Not only were the Cardinals able to get out of <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2508176/david-johnson">David Johnson</a>'s underwater contract, they were able to use it as an asset as part of the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15795/deandre-hopkins">DeAndre Hopkins</a> trade. They are expected to give Hopkins a new contract, but <a href="/nfl/story/_/id/28911663/deandre-hopkins-trade-grade-texans-flunked-cardinals-got-elite-receiver">getting a star wide receiver in the prime of his career</a> for a second-round pick is a bargain when compared to trades past (<a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/stats/_/id/751/joey-galloway">Joey Galloway</a>, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/stats/_/id/1433/randy-moss">Randy Moss</a>) and present (<a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16733/odell-beckham-jr">Odell Beckham Jr.</a>, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2976212/stefon-diggs">Stefon Diggs</a>). Unloading the Johnson contract only makes the Hopkins trade an even bigger win for general manager Steve Keim.</p><p>Arizona still has to make the most out of his skills, but having do-everything defender <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4035462/isaiah-simmons">Isaiah Simmons</a> fall to No. 8 in the draft was exactly what coordinator Vance Joseph would have hoped for. Simmons should be able to solve this team's biggest weakness in 2019 -- its <a href="/nfl/story/_/id/29160784/2020-nfl-offseason-winners-losers-qbs-free-agents-teams-trends" target="_new">inability to cover tight ends</a>.</p><p><b>What went wrong:</b> It's a testament to the Hopkins trade that the Cardinals rank so highly, because I don't love their free-agent signings. They dipped into their future cap by adding voidable years to the contracts for linebackers <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3040180/de'vondre-campbell">De'Vondre Campbell</a> and <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16820/devon-kennard">Devon Kennard</a> and defensive tackle <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2577466/jordan-phillips">Jordan Phillips</a>. Campbell wasn't good in Atlanta, and Phillips is coming off a career season that is totally unsupported by his quarterback knockdown totals (16). Kennard has 14 sacks over the past two seasons, but the Lions have been one of the league's worst defenses, and they cut him because they didn't want to pay him $5.4 million in 2020. The Cardinals are going to give Kennard $6.2 million instead.</p><aside class="inline inline-photo full"><figure><picture ><source data-srcset="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2019%2F1025%2Fr617928_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg&w=570&format=jpg, https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2019%2F1025%2Fr617928_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg&w=1140&cquality=40&format=jpg 2x" media="(min-width: 376px)"><source data-srcset="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2019%2F1025%2Fr617928_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg&w=375, https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2019%2F1025%2Fr617928_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg&w=750&cquality=40&format=jpg 2x" media="(max-width: 375px)"><img  class=" lazyload lazyload" data-image-container=".inline-photo" ></picture><figcaption class="photoCaption">Star cornerback Patrick Peterson will be a free agent in 2021.&nbsp;<cite>Kevin Abele/Icon Sportswire</cite></figcaption></figure></aside><p>The <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2971048/dj-humphries">D.J. Humphries</a> contract (three years, $43.8 million) locks them in for an offensive tackle who has one productive season across five campaigns. Arizona decided to bring back <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/13998/marcus-gilbert">Marcus Gilbert</a>, who has played 12 games over the past three years, as opposed to pursuing a more reliable option at right tackle. (It did draft <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3914630/josh-jones">Josh Jones</a> in the third round.) The Cardinals also didn't manage to address cornerback, meaning they will likely start <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15817/robert-alford">Robert Alford</a> in nickel packages after he struggled badly in 2018 and missed all of 2019 with a broken leg.</p><p><b>What they could have done differently:</b> Using voidable years to pay a player like <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2580/drew-brees">Drew Brees</a> or <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2330/tom-brady">Tom Brady</a> while keeping cap space down is one thing, but to do the same to sign questionable defensive additions is just poor management. The Cardinals need to pay Hopkins and cornerback <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/13980/patrick-peterson">Patrick Peterson</a>, but good organizations find players like Campbell and Kennard on the cheap.</p><p>The Phillips contract also seems like a mistake for a guy who washed out of Miami and had no notable pass-rushing production before 2019. Arizona can get out of the deal after one season for $14.5 million, but it's more realistically a two-year, $20 million pact.</p><p><a name="NO"></a></p><p><b>What's left to do:</b> Re-sign Peterson. The Cardinals' first priority should be locking up their superstar corner, who is entering the final year of his deal. The market for cornerbacks on the wrong side of 30 was bleak this offseason, as players such as <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14398/chris-harris-jr">Chris Harris Jr.</a> and <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/13963/jimmy-smith">Jimmy Smith</a> signed short-term deals, while <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15861/logan-ryan">Logan Ryan</a> remains unsigned. Peterson will turn 30 in July, and while he is playing at a higher level than any of those guys, this could end up being a difficult negotiation if Keim & Co. don't rubber-stamp a huge deal.</p><hr><img alt="" class="floatleft" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/no.png&h=110&w=110" width="31"><h2>9. <a href="/nfl/team/_/name/no/new-orleans-saints">New Orleans Saints</a></h2><p><b>What went right:</b> The Saints brought back <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2580/drew-brees">Drew Brees</a>! While the odds of Brees playing somewhere else seemed remote, well, ask the Patriots about remote odds. It was always going to be tough to keep <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16728/teddy-bridgewater">Teddy Bridgewater</a> as the primary backup, but the Saints were able to get a relative bargain in their one-year, $1.1 million deal with <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2969939/jameis-winston">Jameis Winston</a>. Even if Winston is just the inconsistent quarterback we saw over five years in Tampa Bay, that sort of money is well below market value for a borderline starting quarterback.</p><p>Nobody seems to squeeze out more cap space to add veterans on short-term deals than the Saints, who were back to their usual tricks this offseason. In addition to retaining players such as offensive lineman <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2978278/andrus-peat">Andrus Peat</a> and defensive tackle <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4002046/david-onyemata">David Onyemata</a>, Sean Payton & Co. were able to import safety <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/12426/malcolm-jenkins">Malcolm Jenkins</a>, wide receiver <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/13295/emmanuel-sanders">Emmanuel Sanders</a> and defensive tackle <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15844/margus-hunt">Margus Hunt</a>. With $9.5 million in cap space remaining after cutting three-time Pro Bowler <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15870/larry-warford">Larry Warford</a>, they might not be done shopping.</p><p><b>What went wrong:</b> After using the first-round tender on jack-of-all-trades <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2468609/taysom-hill">Taysom Hill</a>, they elected to lock up the BYU product through 2021 by handing him a one-year, $16.3 million pact that is almost fully guaranteed. Hill has yet to play even half of the offensive snaps in a single game, and there's little evidence that he profiles as a viable long-term replacement for Brees. Hill turns 30 in August, and the Saints have trusted him to throw only 13 passes over the past two years, including one lone attempt over their five games without Brees in 2019. Hill has a passer rating of 46.6 on those throws. As a player who has touched the ball just under 50 times per season over the past two years, his usage rate needs to triple -- or he needs to turn into a useful quarterback after Brees retires -- to justify this deal.</p><p><strong>Read more: <a href="/nfl/story/_/id/28871296/2020-nfl-free-agency-trade-grades-bill-barnwell-tracks-every-big-signing-move">Barnwell graded more than 100 signings and trades this offseason</a></strong></p><p><b>What they could have done differently:</b> Hill is more valuable to New Orleans than he is to anybody else and vice versa. It's difficult to imagine that he would have earned this sort of money on the open market. Tendering Hill at the first-round level was fine, but I would have been willing to go year to year and trust that the team's relationship with Hill would have led to a new deal after the 2020 campaign.</p><p><a name="LAC"></a></p><p><b>What's left to do:</b> Add an edge rusher. One place in which the Saints are relatively thin is on the edge, where they have <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3052743/trey-hendrickson">Trey Hendrickson</a> and little else behind starters <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/13971/cameron-jordan">Cameron Jordan</a> and <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3124058/marcus-davenport">Marcus Davenport</a>. They want to continue developing Davenport after trading two first-round picks for the UTSA product, so that would probably rule out signing an expected starter like <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16734/jadeveon-clowney">Jadeveon Clowney</a> or <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/13373/everson-griffen">Everson Griffen</a>, but I would never rule out a signing when this team is involved. Someone like <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15785/ziggy-ansah">Ziggy Ansah</a> or <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/12438/clay-matthews">Clay Matthews</a> would make sense.</p><hr><img alt="" class="floatleft" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/lac.png&h=110&w=110" width="31"><h2>10. <a href="/nfl/team/_/name/lac/los-angeles-chargers">Los Angeles Chargers</a></h2><p><b>What went right:</b> The Chargers were able to add a number of veterans on what were team-friendly deals relative to the market. Offensive tackle <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/13247/bryan-bulaga">Bryan Bulaga</a> arrived on a three-year, $30 million deal. Cornerback <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14398/chris-harris-jr">Chris Harris Jr.</a> left the Broncos for two years and $17 million. Defensive tackle <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/13281/linval-joseph">Linval Joseph</a> signed on a similar deal. The Chargers won the trade when they dealt tackle <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/13242/russell-okung">Russell Okung</a> to Carolina for guard <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16789/trai-turner">Trai Turner</a>. They even franchised tight end <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3046439/hunter-henry">Hunter Henry</a> and locked up running back <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3068267/austin-ekeler">Austin Ekeler</a> on a four-year, $24.5 million deal. Every deal here looks good.</p><p><b>What went wrong:</b> The one position the Chargers didn't fill was at left tackle; they dealt Okung and never acquired a meaningful replacement. I thought they might go for a left tackle with the sixth overall pick, but they ended up using the selection on quarterback <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4038941/justin-herbert">Justin Herbert</a>. He'll compete with <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14163/tyrod-taylor">Tyrod Taylor</a> for the starting job; history tells us that Herbert should be the starter by the time October rolls around. As someone who thinks <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/5529/philip-rivers">Philip Rivers</a> has something left in the tank, I would consider the drop-off between Rivers and a mix of Taylor and Herbert to be meaningful.</p><aside class="inline inline-photo full"><figure><picture ><source data-srcset="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2020%2F0519%2Fr700115_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg&w=570&format=jpg, https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2020%2F0519%2Fr700115_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg&w=1140&cquality=40&format=jpg 2x" media="(min-width: 376px)"><source data-srcset="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2020%2F0519%2Fr700115_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg&w=375, https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2020%2F0519%2Fr700115_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg&w=750&cquality=40&format=jpg 2x" media="(max-width: 375px)"><img  class=" lazyload lazyload" data-image-container=".inline-photo" ></picture><figcaption class="photoCaption">Tyrod Taylor is expected to be the Chargers' Week 1 starter, but top-10 pick Justin Herbert will compete for the job.&nbsp;<cite>Photo by Robert Hanashiro/USA TODAY Sports</cite></figcaption></figure></aside><p>While it's impossible to talk a team out of taking a young quarterback when they see one they like in the top 10, the trade for <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4241394/kenneth-murray">Kenneth Murray</a> later in the first round is easier to argue. Off-ball linebackers just aren't that hard to come by, and the Chargers essentially valued Murray as a top-15 pick by sending their second- and third-rounders to move up and acquire him. Murray has to turn into a Pro Bowl-caliber player for this move to work. The Patriots were the team that traded down, and <a href="https://grantland.com/the-triangle/bill-belichick-nfl-draft-new-england-patriots/" target="_new">teams that trade up with the Patriots usually regret their move</a>.</p><p><b>What they could have done differently:</b> I would have stayed put and trusted that I could find a middle linebacker in the middle rounds or in free agency to rotate with <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2579621/denzel-perryman">Denzel Perryman</a>. The Chargers likely wouldn't have been able to find a plug-and-play left tackle in the second round, but adding someone like <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4048231/ezra-cleveland">Ezra Cleveland</a> as an option would have left them in better shape than moving forward with <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3052513/sam-tevi">Sam Tevi</a>, <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3123303/trent-scott">Trent Scott</a> and <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4411189/trey-pipkins">Trey Pipkins</a>.</p><p><a name="WSH"></a></p><p><b>What's left to do:</b> Sign <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/6012/jason-peters">Jason Peters</a>. While Peters has been popularly linked to a return with the Eagles, L.A. is the best possible landing spot for the 38-year-old tackle. The moves this organization made this offseason suggest it's trying to win now, even as it retools at quarterback. Peters wasn't at his Hall of Fame best in 2019 and probably won't be again in 2020, but he would be a massive upgrade on the likes of Tevi, Scott and Pipkins.</p><hr><img alt="" class="floatleft" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/wsh.png&h=110&w=110" width="31"><h2>11. <a href="/nfl/team/_/name/wsh/washington-redskins">Washington</a></h2><p><b>What went right:</b> Washington landed Ron Rivera as its new coach, and the two-time Coach of the Year went right to work attempting to fix the defense. Washington brought back <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3045465/kendall-fuller">Kendall Fuller</a>, reunited Rivera with longtime Panthers linebacker <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/8429/thomas-davis-sr">Thomas Davis</a>, and took one-year fliers on defensive backs <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2976210/sean-davis">Sean Davis</a> and <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2969920/ronald-darby">Ronald Darby</a> and linebacker <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16888/kevin-pierre-louis">Kevin Pierre-Louis</a>. The secondary has been a mess in Washington for years, and moving on from <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15124/josh-norman">Josh Norman</a> likely qualifies as addition by subtraction. The team topped the transformation off by using the No. 2 overall pick on pass-rusher <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4241986/chase-young">Chase Young</a>.</p><p><b>What went wrong:</b> Most of the deals I mentioned were reasonable, but the four-year, $40 million deal given to Fuller was too generous for a player who has played only one above-average season. The team also sold low on two disgruntled veterans, tackle <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/13241/trent-williams">Trent Williams</a> and cornerback <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2516049/quinton-dunbar">Quinton Dunbar</a>, although I'm pushing some of the blame for the modest Williams return from San Francisco on deposed executive Bruce Allen. Dunbar, meanwhile, was <a href="/nfl/story/_/id/29182475/giants-deandre-baker-turns-police-armed-robbery-charges">charged with armed robbery</a> last week.</p><p>Rivera didn't do enough to support second-year quarterback <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4040616/dwayne-haskins">Dwayne Haskins</a>. The only veteran receivers Washington imported this offseason were roster fodder like <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16813/logan-thomas">Logan Thomas</a>, <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16786/richard-rodgers">Richard Rodgers</a> and <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16793/cody-latimer">Cody Latimer</a>, the latter of whom was <a href="/nfl/story/_/id/29183341/redskins-receiver-cody-lar-arrested-assault-illegal-discharge-firearm">arrested Saturday on five charges</a> related to discharging his weapon in a Colorado apartment. The organization added <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4360294/antonio-gibson">Antonio Gibson</a> in the third round and <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4029893/antonio-gandy-golden">Antonio Gandy-Golden</a> in the fourth round of the draft, but its move to give up a second-rounder to jump up eight spots last year to draft edge rusher <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3134690/montez-sweat">Montez Sweat</a> cost Washington a chance at adding a more notable wide receiver with the No. 34 pick.</p><p><b>What they could have done differently:</b> When <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2574808/robby-anderson">Robby Anderson</a>'s price dipped, I would have liked to have seen Washington target the former Jets wideout on a similar sort of contract to the two-year, $20 million pact he inked with Carolina. Anderson is probably stretched as a No. 1 wideout, but he would have made an excellent No. 2 across from budding star <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3121422/terry-mclaurin">Terry McLaurin</a>.</p><p><a name="CIN"></a></p><p><b>What's left to do:</b> Extend <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2511708/brandon-scherff">Brandon Scherff</a>. After losing Williams, the next thing for Washington to do to protect Haskins is to retain its star guard. Scherff was retained via the franchise tag on a one-year, $15 million pact, and I'd expect the Iowa product to top that figure on an average annual salary across a new deal. A Scherff extension would likely come in somewhere around five years and $75 million.</p><hr><img alt="" class="floatleft" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/cin.png&h=110&w=110" width="31"><h2>12. <a href="/nfl/team/_/name/cin/cincinnati-bengals">Cincinnati Bengals</a></h2><p><b>What went right:</b> The Bengals added a guy coming off arguably the best season in college football history at the most important position in sports. Quarterback <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3915511/joe-burrow">Joe Burrow</a> is a great start for Cincinnati, which followed in the draft by adding <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4239993/tee-higgins">Tee Higgins</a> at the top of Round 2. With the organization retaining star wideout <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/13983/aj-green">A.J. Green</a> via the franchise tag, Burrow should quietly have one of the league's most exciting wideout corps to target in 2020.</p><p>Everyone knew the Bengals were taking Burrow. What was really surprising about the offseason, though, was their foray into unrestricted free agency. In an attempt to fix a defense that ranked 30th in DVOA a season ago, they signed defensive tackle <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2977670/dj-reader">D.J. Reader</a> from the Texans, cornerbacks <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3045120/mackensie-alexander">Mackensie Alexander</a> and <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2576283/trae-waynes">Trae Waynes</a> from the Vikings and safety <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3051388/vonn-bell">Vonn Bell</a> from the Saints. I'm pretty sure they spent more on defensive free agents this offseason than they did during Marvin Lewis' entire tenure running the team.</p><p><b>What went wrong:</b> Well, some of those deals weren't very good. The three-year, $42 million deal for Waynes stood out as a dramatic contract for a player who was often frustrating in Minnesota. Reader's market grew after an impressive 2019 season, but the Texans were actually slightly better rushing the passer over the past three years with him on the sideline. On a four-year, $53 million deal, Cincinnati is paying Reader to be both a run-plugger and someone who can disrupt the pocket. Last season was the only time Reader knocked down opposing quarterbacks more than six times.</p><aside class="inline inline-photo full"><figure><picture ><source data-srcset="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2019%2F1219%2Fr643686_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg&w=570&format=jpg, https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2019%2F1219%2Fr643686_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg&w=1140&cquality=40&format=jpg 2x" media="(min-width: 376px)"><source data-srcset="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2019%2F1219%2Fr643686_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg&w=375, https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fphoto%2F2019%2F1219%2Fr643686_1296x729_16%2D9.jpg&w=750&cquality=40&format=jpg 2x" media="(max-width: 375px)"><img  class=" lazyload lazyload" data-image-container=".inline-photo" ></picture><figcaption class="photoCaption">No. 1 overall pick Joe Burrow will start immediately for the Bengals, who will compete in a tough AFC North this season.&nbsp;<cite>Brett Davis-USA TODAY Sports</cite></figcaption></figure></aside><p>And while Burrow has plenty of wide receivers, the Bengals didn't really add much to help along the offensive line. <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4040726/jonah-williams">Jonah Williams</a>, a first-round pick last year, will return after missing all of his rookie season, but the only other lineman the organization added was <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16801/xavier-su'a-filo">Xavier Su'a-Filo</a>, who was a mess in Houston before spending the past two years as an injury replacement for the Cowboys. Burrow is a promising prospect, but if he doesn't get protection, it won't be any use.</p><p><b>What they could have done differently:</b> The Waynes deal looked aggressive at the time and arguably looks worse now, given that the cornerback market was relatively mild. I'm not sure there were a lot of teams rushing to give Waynes $14 million per season, and if they were, I would have preferred to let them take that risk.</p><p>Given the slim likelihood of any team trading anything meaningful for <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14012/andy-dalton">Andy Dalton</a> when they knew Burrow was on the way, the Bengals probably would have been better off just cutting Dalton back in March. I'm guessing they knew Dalton was going on the chopping block and didn't figure the Red Rifle's salary into their offseason budgeting, but they could have been a landing point for one of the other backups on the market. Now, they only have <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3042876/ryan-finley">Ryan Finley</a> and <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3921586/jake-dolegala">Jacob Dolegala</a> behind Burrow.</p><p><a name="NYJ"></a></p><p><b>What's left to do:</b> Sign <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15870/larry-warford">Larry Warford</a>. The Bengals should be at the front of the queue for the former Saints guard -- Warford would be a massive upgrade on 2019 fourth-rounder <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4040622/michael-jordan">Michael Jordan</a>. They naturally hope Jordan will develop into a useful starter, but with Burrow already facing major question marks on the right side with Su'a-Filo and <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2576789/bobby-hart">Bobby Hart</a>, I'd rather go after the three-time Pro Bowler as more of a sure thing.

Mosley</a>, new general manager Joe Douglas went all the way in the opposite direction. The former Eagles executive didn't make many headlines, but the moves he made were generally smart, one-year deals for moderate money, as Douglas brought back corner <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2980115/brian-poole">Brian Poole</a> and linebacker <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2977647/jordan-jenkins">Jordan Jenkins</a> and signed defensive back <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16948/pierre-desir">Pierre Desir</a>, receiver <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2972460/breshad-perriman">Breshad Perriman</a> and linebacker <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2576761/patrick-onwuasor">Patrick Onwuasor</a>. Johnson, meanwhile, was cut.</p><p>In an echo of what Brandon Beane did in Buffalo a year ago for <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3918298/josh-allen">Josh Allen</a>, Douglas rebuilt quarterback <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3912547/sam-darnold">Sam Darnold</a>'s line by signing four offensive linemen and retaining <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3116110/alex-lewis">Alex Lewis</a>. Douglas completed the process by using the Jets' first-round pick on massive offensive tackle <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4240090/mekhi-becton">Mekhi Becton</a>. With his second-rounder, Douglas drafted wideout <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4035403/denzel-mims">Denzel Mims</a>. The most important thing for the Jets to do in 2020 is figure out whether they want to keep treating Darnold as their quarterback of the future.</p><p><b>What went wrong:</b> I'm not sure some of the offensive linemen Douglas added are going to be able to protect Darnold. The deals given to Lewis (three years, $18.6 million) and <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2583951/george-fant">George Fant</a> (three years, $27.3 million) might go down as paying replacement-level linemen like viable starters out of hope and desperation. You could make a case that Douglas might have been better off paying for <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2979534/jack-conklin">Jack Conklin</a> at the top of the market while waiting for bargains to shake out as free agency wore on. As an example, the money they gave Lewis could have viably gone toward <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15870/larry-warford">Larry Warford</a>.</p><p>I wish the Jets had added more at receiver, although they were likely hamstrung by the contract handed to injured wideout <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16899/quincy-enunwa">Quincy Enunwa</a>. Did they have the opportunity to top the Cardinals' offer for <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15795/deandre-hopkins">DeAndre Hopkins</a>? The move to sign <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/8479/frank-gore">Frank Gore</a> seemed bizarre; as cool as it is to see Gore playing into his late 30s, they need to find a running back to replace Bell after he's presumably cut next offseason. I'm also not sure it was a great idea to hand coach Adam Gase a second season after a bizarre 2019 campaign; while New York finished 6-2, just two of those wins came against teams who had their Week 1 starting quarterback in the lineup for the majority of the game. One of the losses came to the Bengals, too.</p><p><b>What they could have done differently:</b> If I had to pick one Jets move to take back, Fant sticks out. It's tough to find starting tackles, but Fant was a below-average starter in 2016. After tearing his ACL the following offseason, he has really played only six games as an every-down player, with the Seahawks instead using him as a sixth offensive lineman and swing tackle. Drafting Becton means the Jets can start Fant on the right side, and they can get out of this deal next offseason after paying him $8.9 million in 2020 if Fant can pass a physical, but he's still just a project.</p><p><a name="NYG"></a></p><p><b>What's left to do:</b> Sign <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3115373/jamal-adams">Jamal Adams</a> to an extension. The trade rumors that surrounded Adams last offseason are only going to linger until the Jets get a deal done with their star safety. Adams is still two years away from free agency, but it'll still probably take a four-year, $60 million extension to get the former No. 6 overall pick to commit long term.</p><hr><img alt="" class="floatleft" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/nyg.png&h=110&w=110" width="31"><h2>14. <a href="/nfl/team/_/name/nyg/new-york-giants">New York Giants</a></h2><p><b>What went right:</b> The Giants needed a lot this offseason, and general manager Dave Gettleman addressed many of the biggest concerns. Help in the secondary? They signed corner <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2572841/james-bradberry">James Bradberry</a> from Carolina. A fix for the rotating void at inside linebacker? <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2978273/blake-martinez">Blake Martinez</a> came over from Green Bay. Protection for <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3917792/daniel-jones">Daniel Jones</a>?

(Remember that Garrett was the Ravens' <a href=" https://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=3197523" target="_new">first choice to replace Brian Billick</a> in 2008.) Recent league history is littered with guys like Pat Shurmur, Gary Kubiak and Todd Bowles, each of whom looked behind the times and overwhelmed as head coaches before revitalizing their careers when moved back into a coordinator role. Garrett could do the same in New York.</p><p><b>What went wrong:</b> Bradberry and Martinez both signed expensive deals, with Martinez's three-year, $30.8 million contract sticking out at a typically low-cost position for a player some Packers fans were happy to see leave town. The Giants also didn't address what might be their biggest position of need by adding an edge rusher; they haven't been able to re-sign <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2971432/markus-golden">Markus Golden</a> and only added <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2574229/kyler-fackrell">Kyler Fackrell</a>, whose 10.5-sack season in 2018 sticks out like a sore thumb, given that he had six sacks across his three other seasons combined.</p><p>Gettleman also placed the franchise tag on defensive lineman <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2971622/leonard-williams">Leonard Williams</a>, doubling down on <a href="/nfl/story/_/id/27950334/source-jets-trade-dl-leonard-williams-giants">the inexplicable trade</a> he made to acquire Williams for a going-nowhere Giants team last season. Williams will make $16.2 million and attempt to have his long-awaited breakout season in 2020, while New York will send a fourth-round pick in 2021 to the Jets to go with the third-rounder it shipped this past draft. Williams proceeded to file a grievance in the hopes of being repositioned as a defensive end, which would earn the former USC star an additional $1.7 million.

They also would have netted that pick only if they sat out the top end of free agency, which would have kept them from signing Bradberry.) They could have used the money they saved to sign <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16734/jadeveon-clowney">Jadeveon Clowney</a>, a more talented player at their most obvious weakness.</p><p><a name="LV"></a></p><p><b>What's left to do:</b> Bring back Golden. New York applied the rarely used unrestricted free agent tender to Golden, which would ensure that the team is eligible for a compensatory pick if Golden signs elsewhere. If he doesn't join another team before July 22, the Giants would be the only team eligible to sign him for the upcoming season. The tag offers Golden a one-year, $5.3 million deal, which is a good from the team's perspective, given that he racked up 10.5 sacks and 27 knockdowns in a bounce-back 2019 campaign.</p><hr><img alt="" class="floatleft" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/lv.png&h=110&w=110" width="31"><h2>15. <a href="/nfl/team/_/name/lv/las-vegas-raiders">Las Vegas Raiders</a></h2><p><b>What went right:</b> Jon Gruden and general manager Mike Mayock got to work fixing a defense that has ranked 30th and 31st in defensive DVOA during Gruden's second stint as Raiders coach. <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2614825/carl-nassib">Carl Nassib</a> and <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3040471/maliek-collins">Maliek Collins</a> add two solid rotation players up front.

</aside><p><b>What went wrong:</b> I'm not sure the offense adds up. The Raiders' top two wide receivers are both field-stretchers in Ruggs and <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2587819/tyrell-williams">Tyrell Williams</a>, but Carr's average pass traveled just 6.2 yards in the air last season, the shortest of any starting quarterback's. The only quarterbacks who threw 20 or more yards downfield less frequently were <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2580/drew-brees">Drew Brees</a> and <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16760/jimmy-garoppolo">Jimmy Garoppolo</a>. Maybe the offense will change, but Carr and Mariota haven't been prolific deep passers during their careers.</p><p>For the second year in a row, the Raiders used a first-round pick on a player who was regarded as a bit of a stretch. Last year, it was defensive end <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3728258/clelin-ferrell">Clelin Ferrell</a> at No. 4, a move whose wisdom was not immediately revealed during Ferrell's rookie season. This year, it was taking Arnette in the first round (No. 19) when many expected him to be available in Round 2. Las Vegas didn't have a second-round pick, but trading down would have been a viable option.</p><p><b>What they could have done differently:</b> I was surprised the Raiders brought back defensive coordinator Paul Guenther after two dreadful seasons. The team has unquestionably been transitioning on that side of the ball, but 30th and 31st is hard to defend. With Vegas importing the likes of Joyner and Littleton from the Rams, I thought it might make sense for Gruden to dial up legendary defensive coordinator Wade Phillips, who has a remarkable track record of turning around defenses overnight.</p><p><a name="SF"></a></p><p><b>What's left to do:</b> Bring in competition for <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3051909/daniel-carlson">Daniel Carlson</a>. The Raiders are pretty much set in terms of depth, so if I have to pick one spot in which they could make another addition, I'd look toward kicker. Carlson hit just 19 of his 26 field goal attempts in 2019 and was the league's <a href="https://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/nfl/special-teams/2019" target="_new">fifth-worst kicker on scoring plays by Football Outsiders' kicking measure</a>. They signed rookie free agent <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/stats/_/id/3932960/type/college">Dominik Eberle</a>, but this is a position in which they might want to grab a veteran who gets cut at the end of camp.</p><hr><img alt="" class="floatleft" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/sf.png&h=110&w=110" width="31"><h2>16. <a href="/nfl/team/_/name/sf/san-francisco-49ers">San Francisco 49ers</a></h2><p><b>What went right:</b> The 49ers stuck to their plan on both sides of the ball with their two first-round picks. After trading defensive tackle <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2971282/deforest-buckner">DeForest Buckner</a> to the Colts for the No. 14 pick, they used that selection to draft his replacement, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4259491/javon-kinlaw">Javon Kinlaw</a>.

The two sides agreed to leave Williams' contract on the table for future talks, but he was drafted by the Shanahan family when they were in Washington and should have no problem stepping in as a plug-and-play replacement on the left side of the San Francisco line.</p><p><b>What went wrong:</b> Buckner was one of the NFL's best defensive linemen, and while Kinlaw could develop into a superstar, that dominant 49ers line is going to miss Buckner's talent. San Francisco also re-signed <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2971275/arik-armstead">Arik Armstead</a> to a five-year, $85 million deal, which is an awful lot of money for a player who has only one season in five as an impactful pass-rusher.

The Ravens didn't really replace Hurst, and given how frequently <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3116365/mark-andrews">Mark Andrews</a> has been banged up as a pro, I expected them to use a midround pick to find a backup there.</p><p><b>What they could have done differently:</b> They franchised <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3961466/matthew-judon">Matthew Judon</a> as a linebacker, which saved them about $2 million as opposed to giving him the edge rusher tag. Judon hasn't signed his tag, and with the Ravens unlikely to sign him to an extension, they haven't been able to trade the 27-year-old for a draft pick. Had they known <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16734/jadeveon-clowney">Jadeveon Clowney</a> would be available this late in the offseason, I wonder if they would have simply let Judon hit free agency, picked up a compensatory pick and signed the former first overall selection on a one-year deal.

The Chiefs were able to convince receiver <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16725/sammy-watkins">Sammy Watkins</a> to take a pay cut, and they franchise-tagged star defensive tackle <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3044859/chris-jones">Chris Jones</a>.</p><p><b>What went wrong:</b> Breeland was <a href="/nfl/story/_/id/29110216/chiefs-cornerback-bashaud-breeland-jail-south-carolina-arrest">arrested at gunpoint on May 1</a>. Watkins is still earning nearly $9 million with the chance to earn $6 million more in incentives in 2020, which is a lot for a player who had been ordinary during his first two seasons in Kansas City before breaking out during the postseason. The team also didn't resolve Jones' future with a trade or a long-term contract, meaning it's likely to end up getting one more year out of him before losing him as a free agent in 2021.</p><p>The Chiefs used their first-round pick on running back <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4242214/clyde-edwards-helaire">Clyde Edwards-Helaire</a>, who should end up as one of the most productive backs in football when he takes over as the full-time starter. That's a good thing, but when you look at recent history for this team, just about anybody who has been in that role has been among the most productive backs in football. <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3059915/kareem-hunt">Kareem Hunt</a> was there as a third-round pick. <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/17359/damien-williams">Damien Williams</a> has been a touchdown machine in the playoffs.

Edwards-Helaire could be a star, but I wonder if the Chiefs would have been better off using their first-round pick on a position they've struggled to fill effectively, like cornerback, or targeted a wide receiver to replace Watkins.</p><div data-behavior="video_scroll" class="contentItem__content contentItem__content--media-card contentItem__content--fullWidth contentItem__content--inline"><figure  data-video="native,640,360,29148396" data-cerebro-id="5eb4af7dbe6ab3258271da94" class="media-wrapper_image video" data-source="espn"><picture  class="media-wrapper_image" ><source data-srcset="https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2020%2F0507%2Fevc_NCB_20200507_no_event_name_fdc5737b_a225_4369_1316%2Fevc_NCB_20200507_no_event_name_fdc5737b_a225_4369_1316.jpg&w=640&h=360&cquality=80&format=jpg" media="(min-width: 376px)"><source data-srcset="https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2020%2F0507%2Fevc_NCB_20200507_no_event_name_fdc5737b_a225_4369_1316%2Fevc_NCB_20200507_no_event_name_fdc5737b_a225_4369_1316.jpg&w=335&cquality=80, https://a4.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=%2Fmedia%2Fmotion%2F2020%2F0507%2Fevc_NCB_20200507_no_event_name_fdc5737b_a225_4369_1316%2Fevc_NCB_20200507_no_event_name_fdc5737b_a225_4369_1316.jpg&w=670&cquality=40&format=jpg 2x" media="(max-width: 375px)"><img  class=" lazyload lazyload"  ></picture><span class="video-play-button" data-id="29148396">play</span><figcaption class="media-caption"><div class="media-duration">1:50</div></figcaption></figure><div class="contentItem__contentWrapper"><h1 class="contentItem__title contentItem__title--media">What to make of the Chiefs' 2020 schedule</h1><p class="contentItem__subhead">Louis Riddick goes through the Kansas City Chiefs' 2020 schedule to break down some of the biggest challenges they will face.</p></div></div></video3><p><b>What they could have done differently:</b> Watkins ranks 59th in receiving yards over the past two years, placing him below the likes of <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3892889/dede-westbrook">Dede Westbrook</a>, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2576716/jamison-crowder">Jamison Crowder</a> and <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/13934/antonio-brown">Antonio Brown</a>. <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3139477/patrick-mahomes">Patrick Mahomes</a> has been better with Watkins on the field over the past two years, but the difference isn't enormous: He has posted a passer rating of 112.4 and a QBR of 84.7 with Watkins on the field, dropping off to 106.5 and 77.0, respectively, without the former Bills first-rounder. In a market in which every veteran wideout besides <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14053/randall-cobb">Randall Cobb</a> failed to get the deal they were expecting, Watkins likely wouldn't have come away with a similar deal if the Chiefs had let him go.</p><p><a name="ATL"></a></p><p><b>What's left to do:</b> Extend Mahomes. The team has just $1.4 million in cap space, and it's difficult to imagine the star quarterback's 2020 cap number staying anywhere close to its current figure of $5.3 million on a new deal, so this is going to be a difficult negotiation. His résumé over his first two years as a starter -- league MVP and Super Bowl MVP -- is unprecedented in modern football. Mahomes isn't going anywhere, but can the Chiefs get a deal done now as opposed to 2021, when he will be even more expensive? And will he be the first player in football to sign a contract worth $40 million per season?</p><hr><img alt="" class="floatleft" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/atl.png&h=110&w=110" width="31"><h2>22. <a href="/nfl/team/_/name/atl/atlanta-falcons">Atlanta Falcons</a></h2><p><b>What went right:</b> The Falcons finally acknowledged their need to rebuild on defense.

I'm worried that the Falcons might be fooled by what happened in the second half, when they allowed a league-best 25.8% conversion rate on third downs. Research has suggested that teams that grossly outplay their first- and second-down performance on third down struggle to keep that up, and while they were middle of the pack by expected points added on first and second down during the final eight weeks of the season, they were the league's best defense on third downs.</p><p>You could argue that they didn't have the cap room to make many additions, but after cutting <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16944/devonta-freeman">Devonta Freeman</a>, they still found a way to hand <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2977644/todd-gurley-ii">Todd Gurley</a> a one-year, $5.5 million deal. Even if Gurley returns to form and has a great season, this is the exact sort of organization that needed to focus on finding a cheap, multiyear solution at running back. The Falcons have committed serious resources to their offensive line, have a great passing game and desperately needed to save money for their defense.</p><p><b>What they could have done differently:</b> The money they committed to Gurley could have been part of an offer for someone like <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16734/jadeveon-clowney">Jadeveon Clowney</a>, although it would have also required Atlanta to restructure someone's contract, likely wideout <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/13982/julio-jones">Julio Jones</a>.

Tennessee hasn't yet come to terms on an extension with Henry, which I'm considering a plus given how poorly contracts have aged for running backs. It also lost right tackle <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2979534/jack-conklin">Jack Conklin</a>, but it replaced the former All-Pro by re-upping <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15054/dennis-kelly">Dennis Kelly</a> and using its first-round pick on <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4259568/isaiah-wilson">Isaiah Wilson</a>.</p><p><b>What went wrong:</b> Losing Conklin and cornerback <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15861/logan-ryan">Logan Ryan</a> cost the team two valuable starters, and I'm not sure the Kelly/Wilson combination or free-agent corner <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/9610/johnathan-joseph">Johnathan Joseph</a> are going to be as valuable in their absence. The <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2512400/vic-beasley-jr">Vic Beasley Jr.</a> signing locked the Titans in on a one-year deal for a pass-rusher who has been successful for 1½ of his five pro seasons and didn't offer any ability to keep him if he exceeds expectations.</p><p>Most notably, to get the Tannehill deal done, the Titans practically guaranteed their breakout quarterback three years and $91 million, which is a huge investment for a player whom the Dolphins paid $5 million to sell for a fourth-round pick at this time last year. He was one of the league's best quarterbacks last season, but he has a lengthy injury history. The Titans also want to build around running the football, which makes a $31 million quarterback an expensive accessory.</p><p><b>What they could have done differently:</b> I'm not sure the Titans had much of a choice, but even limiting the Tannehill deal to two guaranteed seasons would have been a much better deal. With hindsight, it's fair to suggest they might have been better off letting him hit the market and going after somebody like <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14877/nick-foles">Nick Foles</a> or <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14012/andy-dalton">Andy Dalton</a> at a much cheaper price. Likewise, for a team that has expressed interest in <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16734/jadeveon-clowney">Jadeveon Clowney</a>, the Titans would have been better off just signing Clowney to a one-year deal as opposed to Beasley. Some of that is hindsight, but the Beasley and Tannehill deals raised questions before we even saw how the rest of those respective markets worked out.</p><p><b>What's left to do:</b> Let Henry play out his franchise tag. When he was asked about a possible extension in January, Henry said the six-year, $90 million extension that <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3051392/ezekiel-elliott">Ezekiel Elliott</a> signed with the Cowboys <a href="https://twitter.com/RichEisenShow/status/1223247751401615364" target="_new">was "the floor."</a> Elliott's deal paid him $37.6 million over its first three years.</p><p><a name="SEA"></a></p><p>Henry's franchise tag is worth $10.2 million in 2020. If the Titans franchised him two more times, in 2021 and 2022, they would end up paying him $40.1 million, which is right about what Elliott's deal included after accounting for cap inflation. They also would retain the leverage of going year to year with the ability to opt out if Henry gets hurt or doesn't live up to expectations. The NFL's running back economics are absolutely warped, and it's unfair to Henry after his production over the past year and a half, but the Titans will likely <a href="/nfl/story/_/id/28121690/all-nfl-running-backs-get-paid-2020-why-recent-deals-look-disasters" target="_new">regret it if they give him a Zeke-sized deal</a>.</p><hr><img alt="" class="floatleft" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/sea.png&h=110&w=110" width="31"><h2>26. <a href="/nfl/team/_/name/sea/seattle-seahawks">Seattle Seahawks</a></h2><p><b>What went right:</b> The Seahawks added significant offensive line depth, re-signing <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/13246/mike-iupati">Mike Iupati</a> and signing the likes of <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2512172/bj-finney">B.J.

The former first overall pick is still a free agent, but Seattle was 30th in adjusted sack rate with him and could be even worse without him. The two-year, $23 million deal the team gave defensive tackle <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3115312/jarran-reed">Jarran Reed</a> had a player-friendly structure, and it kept the franchise aligned with a player who was <a href="/nfl/story/_/id/27239255/nfl-suspends-seahawks-dt-reed-6-games">suspended for six games after being accused of domestic assault</a> last year.</p><p>While it's obviously too early to make significant judgments about draft picks, Seattle's first-round selection of off-ball linebacker <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4043130/jordyn-brooks">Jordyn Brooks</a> was widely seen as a stretch for both the player and the positional value.

The line was a mess last season, and <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3046779/jared-goff">Jared Goff</a> just isn't good enough to overcome heavy pressure. He posted a league-worst passer rating of 34.5 under pressure. Even if second-round pick <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4240021/cam-akers">Cam Akers</a> turns into a superstar, the Rams should have waited to target a running back.</p><p><a name="DET"></a></p><p><b>What's left to do:</b> Sign Ramsey (or wide receiver <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2977187/cooper-kupp">Cooper Kupp</a>). Both Kupp and Ramsey are in the final year of their respective deals, and the Rams don't want to head to the 2021 offseason with the two stars vying for one franchise tag. They also will have to work on deals for tight end <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3918639/gerald-everett">Gerald Everett</a> and defensive backs <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3046292/john-johnson-iii">John Johnson III</a> and <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2525933/troy-hill">Troy Hill</a> next year, and while some of their pending free agents will be allowed to leave, they probably want to lock up at least one of their big two before the season begins. Ramsey will look to reset the cornerback market and will be asking something in the range of $20 million per season.</p><hr><img alt="" class="floatleft" src="https://a.espncdn.com/combiner/i?img=/i/teamlogos/nfl/500/det.png&h=110&w=110" width="31"><h2>29. <a href="/nfl/team/_/name/det/detroit-lions">Detroit Lions</a></h2><p><b>What went right:</b> The Lions went all-in on rebuilding their oft-frustrating secondary, trading cornerback <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15863/darius-slay">Darius Slay</a> and replacing him by signing <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15812/desmond-trufant">Desmond Trufant</a> and drafting <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4241984/jeff-okudah">Jeff Okudah</a> at No. 3 overall. On paper, the trio of Okudah, Trufant and <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2577707/justin-coleman">Justin Coleman</a> would rank as one of the best cornerback combinations in the league. Trading for safety <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15842/duron-harmon">Duron Harmon</a> completed the defensive back makeover. They will miss Slay, but even with him on the field last season, they allowed a passer rating of 97.4, which would have been the eighth-worst mark in the league.</p><p><b>What went wrong:</b> Coach Matt Patricia and general manager Bob Quinn elected to rebuild most of their defense by acquiring the players Bill Belichick didn't want to keep, a move that typically turns out poorly for other teams. <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15830/jamie-collins-sr">Jamie Collins</a>' three-year, $30 million deal seemed particularly onerous for a linebacker who was a mess outside of New England during his run with Cleveland. The Lions will now start four former Pats on defense in Collins, Harmon, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2574519/trey-flowers">Trey Flowers</a> and <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2578384/danny-shelton">Danny Shelton</a>. They look perilously thin along the defensive line, and while Belichick has been able to mold middling players into contributors across his front seven, Patricia's players have generally been better elsewhere than they were playing for him in Detroit.</p><aside class="inline float-r inline-track"><h1>NFL's Greatest Games</h1><img data-lazyload="true" data-src="https://a.espncdn.com/photo/2019/1010/16x9.jpg" class="round lazyload"><p>Relive some of the league's most memorable games, from Super Bowl XLII to the 2018 AFC title game. <b><a href="https://www.espn.com/watch/collections/23537/nfl-s-greatest-games" target="_blank">Watch on ESPN+</a></b></p>
</aside><p>The Lions also weren't able to parlay the No. 3 draft pick into a bidding war between the Chargers and Dolphins, forcing them to stay put. Okudah should be an impact cornerback, and I don't have any issue with them drafting him, but this team could have sorely used an extra first-round pick. Detroit used its second-round pick on running back <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4259545/d'andre-swift">D'Andre Swift</a>, and while he is a talented player, this isn't a roster that can afford to use two second-round picks on running backs across three years. You could argue <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3916925/kerryon-johnson">Kerryon Johnson</a> is a sunk cost, but the Lions could have addressed running back with one of a number of veterans at minimal cost.</p><p>Instead, Detroit hit free agency yet again, and its deals were questionable. Trufant hasn't lived up to expectations over the past three seasons. The five-year, $45 million deal it handed <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2971557/halapoulivaati-vaitai">Halapoulivaati Vaitai</a> pays the former Eagles swing tackle like he is an upper-echelon starter. It sure looks reminiscent of the big deal that Detroit handed former starting right tackle <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15900/rick-wagner">Rick Wagner</a>, which didn't work out.</p><p><b>What they could have done differently:</b> Resisted the urge to go after as many former Patriots as possible. The Collins deal is a mess, and under Belichick, the Patriots have exhibited the ability to develop players such as Shelton and Harmon into useful contributors. Patricia and Quinn are trying to buy them instead. If the Lions couldn't trade down in the first round, they should have used their second-rounder on a position that's tougher to fill than halfback.</p><p><a name="NE"></a></p><p><b>What's left to do:</b> Add defensive line help.

I'd love to see the Lions sign <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16734/jadeveon-clowney">Jadeveon Clowney</a>, but more realistically, this would be a landing spot for somebody like <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14036/jabaal-sheard">Jabaal Sheard</a> on the edge or <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/13992/marcell-dareus">Marcell Dareus</a> on the interior.

Even a diminished Brady would still project to be a playoff-caliber quarterback with the sort of defense this team had in 2019; the same thing isn't clear with Stidham, who appears to be the Week 1 starter.

Given that Brady ended up netting only a two-year, $50 million deal on the open market, this team could have made him a credible multiyear offer to stick around for the remainder of his career.</p><p>Would Brady have taken that kind of offer if the Pats had made it at this time last year? It's impossible to say. Given what both sides had to gain, though, it's not hard to imagine a common ground where the Patriots could have given him a new deal with two years of guarantees and a voidable year or two attached to help create short-term cap space. (The Pats used that space on <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/13934/antonio-brown">Antonio Brown</a>, which is another thing that didn't go well.)</p><p>Belichick is obviously not stupid; the Patriots chose not to make that sort of offer for a reason.

(I know that sounds weird, but in the NFL, the middle of May comes after June 1.)

Foles could work out as the team's starter, but this is the equivalent of signing an expensive three-year gym membership as a college senior. There couldn't have been much of a market for Foles, and <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/14012/andy-dalton">Andy Dalton</a>, who was cut by the Bengals after the draft, came without the pick or significant cash attached.</p><p>The <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/13232/jimmy-graham">Jimmy Graham</a> deal was likely the worst contract of free agency, as a Bears team that had already committed significant assets to tight ends <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/15974/dion-sims">Dion Sims</a>, <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4198676/adam-shaheen">Adam Shaheen</a> and <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16974/trey-burton">Trey Burton</a> under Pace gave Graham a two-year, $16 million deal with $9 million guaranteed and a truly inexplicable no-trade clause.

There are still questions about what this team has at wide receiver and in the secondary, where it will likely need second-rounder <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/4243253/jaylon-johnson">Jaylon Johnson</a> to start as a rookie.</p><p><b>What they could have done differently:</b> Waited out the quarterback market.

Even if Hopkins wanted a new deal, the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/2976212/stefon-diggs">Stefon Diggs</a> trade saw the Vikings send a less productive player with a reputation of creating drama inside his building to the Bills for a much greater haul, most <a href="/nfl/story/_/id/28914153/source-bills-acquire-wr-stefon-diggs-vikings-4-draft-picks">notably a first-round pick</a>. Beating the Vikings to the punch for that Bills deal would have been more defensible.</p><p><b>What's left to do:</b> Trade <a href="http://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16016/kenny-stills">Kenny Stills</a>. The Texans don't really have a need for Stills as their fourth wide receiver behind Cobb, <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/16731/brandin-cooks">Brandin Cooks</a> and <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/player/_/id/3052876/will-fuller-v">Will Fuller</a>, and the former Dolphins wideout has $7 million in unguaranteed money due on the final year of his deal. There's an obvious fit here with the Packers, who didn't get all of their shopping done this offseason.</p>
