<h3>12:49 GMT - Catastrophe unfolding in southern Yemen: medical charity</h3>
<p>The main coronavirus treatment centre in southern Yemen has recorded at least 68 deaths in just over two weeks, the medical charity running the site has said, more than double the toll announced by Yemeni authorities so far.</p>
<p>Doctors Without Borders (MSF) said the dedicated COVID-19 centre in Aden that serves the entire south admitted 173 patients from April 30 to May 17, at least 68 of whom died, suggesting "a wider catastrophe unfolding in the city".</p>
<p>"What we are seeing in our treatment centre is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of the number of people infected and dying in (Aden)," Caroline Seguin, MSF's operations manager for Yemen, said in a statement.</p>
<p>"People are coming to us too late to save, and we know that many more people are not coming at all: they are just dying at home."</p>

<h3>12:05 GMT - One in six Spanish children depressed during pandemic: Survey</h3>
<p>Nearly one in six Spanish children have felt regularly depressed during the pandemic, with those from poorer backgrounds suffering worse, a charity has said.</p>
<p>Spain has had one of the world's strictest lockdowns, including keeping children behind doors for weeks, to curb the outbreak which has killed nearly 28,000 people.</p>
<p>Save the Children said its survey from April showed that while lockdown was enabling many families to enjoy more time together, still 17 percent of children felt depressed often or daily and new economic hardships were widening inequalities.</p>

<h3>11:03 GMT - Despite closed borders, Argentina to fly in rabbis to certify kosher meat</h3>
<p>Argentina, which has enforced one of the world's toughest travel bans, plans to help charter a private flight to bring in rabbis from Israel to certify meat at the country's packing plants for kosher markets around the world.</p>
<p>The trip is key to Argentina being able to maintain beef exports to key buyer Israel, which has become increasingly important with exports stalled to the European Union and sharply down to major buyer China.</p>
<p>"The only alternative has been to be able to try to arrange a charter in combination with Israeli clients, and supervised, authorized and coordinated by the governments," said Mario Ravettino, head of Argentina's ABC meat export consortium.</p>

<h3>10:46 GMT - South Africa scientists say up to 50,000 deaths possible</h3>
<p>South Africa could see up to 50,000 coronavirus deaths and as many as three million infections by the end of the year as the southern hemisphere winter leads to a higher rate of infection, scientific models have showed.</p>
<p>The country already has the highest number of infections and deaths on the continent, with more than 18,000 identified cases and 339 deaths, but a national lockdown entering its sixth week had slowed infections.</p>
<p>However, scientists and statisticians hired by the health ministry to model the spread of the disease said the country could see between 35,000 and 50,000 coronavirus deaths by November.</p>

<h3>03:13 GMT - Trump threatens funds for US states easing voting during pandemic</h3>
<p>President Donald Trump has threatened to hold up federal funds for two election battleground states of Michigan and Nevada that are trying to make it easier and safer to vote during the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>He later backed away from that threat but stuck with his unsupported claim that widespread voting by mail promotes "a lot of illegality". The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends voting by mail as a safe option during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Trump has said repeatedly, without evidence, that mailed ballots allow widespread fraud and has worried publicly that wide availability could lead so many people to vote that Republicans would lose in November.</p>

<h3>02:50 GMT - Cambodia lifts entry ban from six countries as coronavirus eases</h3>
<p>Cambodia has announced the lifting of a travel ban of tourists from Iran, Italy, Germany, Spain, France and the US.</p>
<p>In an announcement late on Wednesday, the country's health ministry said visitors from those countries need to present a certificate no more than 72 hours old confirming that they are free from the virus, as well as proof of $50,000 health insurance coverage.</p>
<p>The visitors are also required to quarantine for 14 days upon the arrival.</p>
<h3>02:09 GMT - Recession-hit Japan's exports, imports fall due to pandemic</h3>
<p>Recession-hit Japan's exports plunged nearly 22 percent in April, the country's worst drop in more than a decade as the coronavirus pandemic slammed global demand, AP news agency reported.</p>
<p>The Finance Ministry also said on Thursday that imports fell 7 percent.</p>
<p>The drop in exports is the worst since the 2008 financial crisis, as export-dependent Japan struggles to juggle the health risks of COVID-19 with the dire need to keep the economy going.</p>
<p>Japan is in a technical recession after a contraction that began in the last quarter of last year deepened in the January-March quarter. Analysts say worse may be ahead, given the economic pain of the pandemic may be prolonged.</p>

<h3>01:38 GMT - Merkel says Germany not cutting foreign aid</h3>
<p>German Chancellor Angela Merkel says the country won't be cutting foreign aid due to the coronavirus pandemic, and further relief for poor nations is needed.</p>
<p>Speaking on Wednesday after a video meeting with heads of the World Bank, the International Monetary fund and three other global economic bodies, Merkel noted last month's agreement to freeze poor countries' debt obligations and said that "as far as the sustainability of debt is concerned further steps need to follow".</p>

<h3>01:17 GMT - New Zealand's Ardern proposes four-day workweek</h3>
<p>New Zealand's prime minister wants employers to consider switching to a four-day workweek as a way to promote tourism, which has been hard-hit by the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Jacinda Ardern said in a Facebook Live video that people had learned a lot about flexibility and working from home during the nation's lockdown, which was eased last week.</p>
<p>New Zealand's tourism industry had accounted for about 10 percent of the economy, but has ground to a halt during the outbreak, according to the Associated Press news agency.</p>
<p>The South Pacific nation's borders remain closed, but Ardern said that as much as 60 percent of tourism was domestic and that more flexible working arrangements could allow New Zealanders to travel more within their own country.</p>

<h3>00:01 GMT - Large contingent of Cuban doctors help Mexico with coronavirus</h3>
<p>At least 500 Cuban health workers are helping tackle the new coronavirus in Mexico City, Mexican officials told Reuters news agency, making it likely the largest contingent the communist-led island has deployed globally as part of its response to the pandemic.</p>
<p>Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum has publicly acknowledged the presence of "several" Cuban doctors working in the city's hospitals to help make up staffing shortfalls, but she has not confirmed the scale of the deployment.</p>
<p>A federal health ministry told Reuters there were now 600 Cuban health workers on the ground. Both sources asked not to be identified. Cuba has for decades sent medical professionals to countries across Latin America and as far afield as Africa to help during health crises.</p>
