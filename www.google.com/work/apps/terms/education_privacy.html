              This Privacy Notice is meant to help G Suite for Education users and parents
              understand what data we collect, why we collect it, and what we do with it. This
              Notice includes information about our privacy practices that are specific to G Suite
              for Education and summarizes the most relevant portions of the <a href=
              "https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/">Google Privacy Policy</a>, which
              provides additional examples and explanations that may be useful. We hope you will
              take the time to read this Notice and the Google Privacy Policy, which both apply to
              G Suite for Education accounts.
            </p><strong>Information we collect</strong>
            <p>
              A G Suite for Education account is a Google Account created and managed by a school
              for use by students and educators. When creating this account, the school may provide
              Google with certain personal information about its students and educators, which
              includes a user’s name, email address, and password in most cases, but could also
              include secondary email, phone, and address if the school chooses to provide that
              information. Google may also collect personal information directly from users of G
              Suite for Education accounts, such as telephone number, profile photo or other
              <a href=
              "https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/27442?hl=en&amp;visit_id=1-636361886285506712-1123491408&amp;rd=1">
              information</a> they add to a G Suite for Education account.
            </p>
            <p>
              Google also collects information based on the use of our services. This includes:
            </p>
            <ul class="legal-doc-bulleted">
              <li class="list-element">device information, such as the hardware model, operating

            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>In G Suite for Education Core Services</strong>
              </li>
              <li>The G Suite for Education Core Services (“Core Services”) are listed in the
              <a href="https://gsuite.google.com/intl/en/terms/user_features.html">Services
              Summary</a> and include Gmail, Calendar, Classroom, Contacts, Drive, Docs, Forms,
              Groups, Sheets, Sites, Slides, Talk/Hangouts, Vault, and Chrome Sync. These services
              are provided to a school under its <a href=
              "https://gsuite.google.com/intl/en/terms/education_terms.html">G Suite for Education
              agreement</a> and, as applicable, <a href=
              "https://gsuite.google.com/intl/en/terms/dpa_terms.html">Data Processing
              Amendment</a>. (Users and parents can ask their school if it has accepted the Data
              Processing Amendment.)
              </li>
              <li>User personal information collected in the Core Services is used only to provide
              the Core Services. Google does not serve ads in the Core Services or use personal
              information collected in the Core Services for advertising purposes.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>In Google services generally</strong>
              </li>
              <li>Besides the Core Services, G Suite for Education users may have access to other
              Google services that we make generally available for consumers, such as Google Maps,
              Blogger, and YouTube. We call these “Additional Services” since they are outside of
              the Core Services.
              </li>
              <li>The Google Privacy Policy describes fully <a href=
              "https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/#infouse">how Google services generally use
              information</a>, including for G Suite for Education users. To summarize, we use the
              information we collect from all of our services to provide, maintain, protect and
              improve them, to develop new ones, and to protect Google and our users. We also use
              this information to offer users tailored content, such as more relevant search
              results. We may combine personal information from one service with information,
              including personal information, from other Google services.
              </li>
              <li>Google may serve ads to G Suite for Education users in the Additional Services.
              For G Suite for Education users in primary and secondary (K-12) schools, Google does
              not use any user personal information (or any information associated with a G Suite
              for Education Account) to target ads, whether in Core Services or other Google
              services accessed while using a G Suite for Education account.

            </p><strong>Information users share</strong>
            <p>
              A school may allow students to access Google services such as Google Docs and Sites,
              which include features where users can share information with others or publicly.
              When users share information publicly, it may be indexable by search engines,
              including Google. Our services provide users with various options for <a href=
              "https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/example/sharing.html">sharing</a> and

              content</a>.
            </p><strong>Information we share</strong>
            <p>
              Information we collect may be shared outside of Google in limited circumstances. We
              do not share personal information with companies, organizations and individuals
              outside of Google unless one of the following circumstances applies:

              <li class="list-element">
                <strong>With user consent.</strong> We will share personal information with

                reasonably necessary to:

            <p>
              We may share non-personal information publicly and with our partners – like
              publishers or connected sites. For example, we may share information publicly to show
              trends about the general use of our services.
            </p><strong>Transparency and choice</strong>
            <p>
              We provide a variety of user controls that enable G Suite for Education users to make
              meaningful choices about how information is used in Google services. Depending on the
              settings enabled by the school, users can use the various controls described in the
              <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/#infochoices">Privacy Policy</a>,
              such as <a href=
              "https://myaccount.google.com/privacy?hl=en&amp;pli=1#accounthistory">Google activity
              controls</a>, to manage their privacy and information. We provide additional
              information for parents, students, and administrators on the <a href=
              "https://www.google.com/edu/trust/">G Suite for Education Privacy Center</a>.
            </p><strong>Parental review and deletion of information</strong>
            <p>
              The parents of G Suite for Education users in Primary/Secondary (K-12) schools can
              access their child’s personal information or request that it be deleted through the
              school administrator. School administrators can provide for parental access and
              deletion of personal information consistent with the functionality of our services.
              If a parent wishes to stop any further collection or use of the child's information,
              the parent can request that the administrator use the service controls available to
              them to limit the child’s access to features or services, or delete the child’s
              account entirely. Guidance for administrators on how to use service controls to
              accomplish this is available in the G Suite <a href=
              "https://support.google.com/a">Help Center</a>.
            </p><strong>Interpretation of conflicting terms</strong>
            <p>
              This Notice is intended to provide the key information about our collection and use
