&nbsp;Why would he care.<\/i>&nbsp; I refused, since it made no sense to me at all. &nbsp;It made so little sense that I was even more wary of bringing the dog, and more concerned about what was happening. &nbsp;She called him herself, and I could hear both sides of the conversation. &nbsp;He said it didn&#8217;t matter, and that we should just come&#8230; &#8220;everyone was waiting for us.&#8221;<\/div>\n<blockquote class=\"tr_bq\" style=\"text-align:justify;\"><p>Later I would deduce that the dog bed, the one that Mary had made a huge fuss about ordering from amazon, and then two magically appeared was the &#8216;storage unit&#8217; for the narcotics that she had warned me about. &nbsp;It had clicked at the time that it was related to the dog, though I wasn&#8217;t sure if it was swallowed balloons or exactly how the dog was related to the issue. &nbsp;It would become very clear very soon, but at the time, it was just another very strange thing surrounding Mary.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">We left, and arrived about 6 hours later, late at night, and slept until morning. &nbsp;Mary&#8217;s aunt had been nice enough to get us a free room at the hotel she worked at in the area, and we really needed the sleep. &nbsp;The next day, the Thanksgiving day affairs were&nbsp;relatively&nbsp;normal, until the very end. &nbsp; After dinner and a few hours of talking Mary approached me with a very concerned look on her face. &nbsp;She said we were leaving right then, as if something had happened, someone had told her something and she was downright frightened. &nbsp;I immediately agreed to go, and then her uncle tried to stop us. &nbsp;He said he wanted to follow us back to the hotel, and then made the strangest comment I&#8217;ve ever heard come out of the mouth of a family member. &nbsp;Mary had had one or two drinks, and he said that she &#8220;might get rear ended&#8221; on the way back to the hotel&#8230; or &#8220;he might just do it himself.&#8221; &nbsp;I was appalled, and I told him as much&#8230; <i>Was that a threat?<\/i>&nbsp; It made no sense to me, and I insisted then that we leave, which we did. &nbsp; We left the area in fact, and drove to nearby Orlando for the rest of the weekend, with the intention of going to an amusement park &#8212; hopefully to regain normalcy in our lives.<\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">We arrived in Orlando, and spent the night at a hotel near Universal Studio&#8217;s. &nbsp;There were several in a large semi circle right by the entrance, and I picked the first one I saw. &nbsp;The next day, the strangeness continued. &nbsp;Half of her family had followed us to Orlando, and they too were going to the theme park. &nbsp;Mary&#8217;s father, his spouse, and her cousin were also going to Universal&#8230;. <i>awesome<\/i>, <i>there&#8217;s no getting away from this.<\/i><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\"><i><br \/><\/i><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">The next day we went to Universal, and things were certainly no more normal than they had been in the previous weeks. &nbsp;Mary stopped me before we entered the actual park, and told me that &#8220;they&#8221; wanted us to drive back to South Florida that day. &nbsp;<i>Why<\/i>&nbsp;<i>would we do that?<\/i>&nbsp;Whatever had happened the previous evening, she seemed to have changed her mind. &nbsp;I asked her what was going on, specifically asking about what she had told me before we left South Florida. &nbsp;&#8220;I think they put something in the car at my aunt&#8217;s hotel, and they need it back at home.&#8221; &nbsp;She tells me coolly. &nbsp;It was like they were trying to trick us into being drug mules, without even having the decency to ask&#8230; &nbsp;I just didn&#8217;t get it, the audacity of the situation made no sense to me. &nbsp;We got in an argument about it&#8230; I told her I&#8217;d rather leave the car in the parking lot and take a plane home, I wanted nothing to do with whatever odd crap her family was into.. <b>nothing.<\/b>&nbsp; At this, Mary offered me &#8220;half&#8221; of what she was getting paid for the &#8220;job.&#8221; &nbsp;&#8220;Half?&#8221; I asked, &#8220;of what?&#8221;<\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">&#8220;Well.. nothing I guess.&#8221;<\/div>\n<blockquote class=\"tr_bq\" style=\"text-align:justify;\"><p>I just about had a coronary. &nbsp;Even if all of this were true, what kind of &#8220;family&#8221; would take advantage of their children like this? &nbsp;Making them &#8220;work&#8221; for nothing. &nbsp;The whole thing made so little sense to me, that looking back on it, I&#8217;m pretty sure none of it was true. &nbsp;At the time though, it all seemed very real. &nbsp;Regardless, I wasn&#8217;t going to be pushed around like this, and made it a point to search the car <b>thoroughly <\/b>as soon as we left. &nbsp;I didn&#8217;t find anything, and I wasn&#8217;t sure if it was because there was nothing there, or it had just been hidden too well. &nbsp;We never made it to the park that day, and those two things combined made me <b>want<\/b>&nbsp;to stay in Orlando instead of going back home early. &nbsp;We left the park, and went to another nearby hotel on the same stretch of road.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n"}
