Recent public advances in nanotechnology should give further credence to the possibility of \u201cfunctional\u201d mind control being possible through the direct electrical stimulation of neurons either utilizing a remote power source, or more likely the ion&#8217;s available for the brain&#8217;s own endogenous function.  When you add in the fact that military science is most likely at least thirty years ahead of public disclosure, it should be at least plausible to a free thinking person that the possibility of mind control exists.&nbsp;<\/span><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman, serif;\"><\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"tr_bq\"><p><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman, serif;\"><\/span><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman, serif;\"><\/span><\/p>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman, serif;\">Further, there are <b>many<\/b> publicly disclosed oddities which further attest to the fact that the government has had access to mind control technology for some time.  First and foremost, I believe anyone that has any knowledge of the operations of the CIA would certainly attest to the fact that disclosure and destruction of the MK-Ultra project is almost certainly the biggest lie the CIA has ever told to Congress or the American people.  It should be obvious that whether or not the disclosed project actually procured a workable \u201cManchurian\u201d candidate, the mind of an intelligence agency (as we have seen countless times through ignorance of congressional and supreme court decisions regarding warrantless wiretapping and surveillance) would only to bring that project <i>further black<\/i>which certainly implicates organized crime as a possible vector for continuing research.  Second, both the MK-Ultra and Soviet \u201cpsychotronics\u201d propaganda were more likely a cover for a more workable and universal mind control technology than they were \u201cleaks\u201d from intelligence agencies about top secret technology.  In my mind, the public disclosure of both of these movements in intelligence should be viewed by the general public as an information operation on their own government&#8217;s employees as well as the general public.  These are operations by intelligence agencies designed in order to obfuscate the truth.  Third, it is my contention that the <b>GRILLFLAME<\/b>and <b>STARGATE<\/b> projects, which were publicly disclosed military operations which went on for over 2.5 decades were nothing more than a covert military operation designed in order to transmit intelligence from <i>still<\/i>undisclosed military reconnaissance satellites as well as the mind control program, utilizing the mind control program as a covert method of disseminating this information to a lower echelon of the military which was not cleared to know about the satellites, SIGINT such as Echelon, or the neural surveillance.   It should also be noted that it is almost idiotic that the military and the Government have not confirmed the existence of real time satellite imagery being available to intelligence agencies, the military, the FBI, other federal agencies, and possibly local police forces in our own skies pointed directly at US Citizens.  Please understand that a decade ago, the disclosure of such technology would have caused a public outcry, and while it would probably go almost unnoticed today, it is still a gross violation of privacy, and an insult to the intelligence of the American people not to be making the existence of this imagery available, and most especially not to be allowing its use in court cases where it could prove innocence or guilt.<\/span><\/div>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman, serif;\"><\/span><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<div class=\"western\" style=\"line-height:150%;margin-bottom:0;margin-left:0;page-break-inside:auto;text-align:justify;\"><\/p>\n<blockquote style=\"background-color:white;border-left-color:rgb(221,221,221);border-left-style:solid;border-left-width:5px;color:#333333;font-family:'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif;font-size:10.909090995789px;line-height:16.5px;margin:0;padding:0 15px;text-align:left;\">\n<div style=\"line-height:1.5em;\">The&nbsp;<strong>Stargate Project<\/strong>[1]&nbsp;was the umbrella&nbsp;code name&nbsp;of one of several sub-projects established by the U.S. Federal Government to investigate claims of&nbsp;psychic&nbsp;phenomena with potential military and domestic applications, particularly &#8220;remote viewing&#8221;: the purported ability to psychically &#8220;see&#8221; events, sites, or&nbsp;information&nbsp;from a great distance.[2]&nbsp;These projects were active from the 1970s through 1995, and followed up&nbsp;early psychic researchdone at The&nbsp;Stanford Research Institute&nbsp;(SRI), Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), The&nbsp;American Society for Psychical Research, and other psychical research labs.[3]<\/div>\n<div style=\"line-height:1.5em;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"line-height:1.5em;\">The Stargate Project was terminated in 1995 following an independent review which concluded:<span class=\"photo_right\" style=\"clear:right;float:right;max-width:180px;padding:2px 0 5px 10px;\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"photo_img img\" src=\"https:\/\/fbcdn-photos-a.akamaihd.net\/hphotos-ak-prn1\/545231_213330765470839_954284072_a.jpg\" \/><\/span><\/div>\n<div style=\"line-height:1.5em;\">The foregoing observations provide a compelling argument against continuation of the program within the intelligence community. Even though a statistically significant effect has been observed in the laboratory, it remains unclear whether the existence of a paranormal phenomenon, remote viewing, has been demonstrated. The laboratory studies do not provide evidence regarding the origins or nature of the phenomenon, assuming it exists, nor do they address an important methodological issue of inter-judge reliability.<\/div>\n<div style=\"line-height:1.5em;\"><\/div>\n<p>Further, even if it could be demonstrated unequivocally that a paranormal phenomenon occurs under the conditions present in the laboratory paradigm, these conditions have limited applicability and utility for intelligence gathering operations. For example, the nature of the remote viewing targets are vastly dissimilar, as are the specific tasks required of the remote viewers. Most importantly, the information provided by remote viewing is vague and ambiguous, making it difficult, if not impossible, for the technique to yield information of sufficient quality and accuracy of information for actionable intelligence. Thus, we conclude that continued use of remote viewing in intelligence gathering operations is not warranted.<\/p>\n<div style=\"line-height:1.5em;\">\u2014&nbsp;Executive summary, &#8220;An Evaluation of Remote Viewing: Research and Applications&#8221;, American Institutes for Research, Sept. 29, 1995[4]<\/div>\n<\/blockquote>\n<div style=\"background-color:white;color:#333333;font-family:'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif;font-size:10.909090995789px;line-height:16.5px;text-align:left;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"background-color:white;color:#333333;font-family:'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif;font-size:10.909090995789px;line-height:16.5px;text-align:left;\">Seriously, 25 years to &#8220;research&#8221; that? &nbsp;I have news for you,<strong>&nbsp;they&#8217;re not that stupid.<\/strong><\/div>\n<div style=\"background-color:white;color:#333333;font-family:'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif;font-size:10.909090995789px;line-height:16.5px;text-align:left;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"background-color:white;color:#333333;font-family:'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif;font-size:10.909090995789px;line-height:16.5px;text-align:left;\"><\/div>\n<blockquote style=\"background-color:white;border-left-color:rgb(221,221,221);border-left-style:solid;border-left-width:5px;color:#333333;font-family:'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif;font-size:10.909090995789px;line-height:16.5px;margin:0;padding:0 15px;text-align:left;\">\n<div style=\"line-height:1.5em;\"><strong>Israel&#8217;s Quest for Satellite Intelligence<\/strong><\/div>\n<div style=\"line-height:1.5em;\"><strong><em>E. L. Zorn<\/em><\/strong><\/div>\n<div style=\"line-height:1.5em;\">In the spring of 1995, the successful orbiting of&nbsp;<em>Ofeq-3<\/em>&nbsp;(the name is the Hebrew word for &#8220;horizon&#8221;) represented the initial satisfaction of a longstanding Israeli desire: an independent space reconnaissance capability. For more than 20 years before they began receiving imagery from the satellite, Israeli defense officials had recognized that spacecraft offered unique capabilities to intensify information gathering in adjacent countries while extending their intelligence reach to more distant lands. After the nation was almost overwhelmed in 1973, Israeli intelligence officers further focused their efforts on preventing future surprise attacks. Satellite photography was seen as a vital tool, able to provide unprecedented warning about the movement of enemy troops and equipment in preparation for war, as well as the movement of enemy forces once hostilities were underway.<\/div>\n<div style=\"line-height:1.5em;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"line-height:1.5em;\">The value of satellite imagery was not unknown to the Israelis before the Yom Kippur war. Faced with invading armies on two fronts in October 1973, Israeli military attach\u00e9s in Washington urgently requested satellite information from the United States about the disposition of the Egyptian and Syrian forces. According to former Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) Chief of Staff Gen. Mordecai Gur, who had been one of those attach\u00e9s, US authorities responded that the information was unavailable due to &#8220;damage&#8221; to the satellite.<strong>1<\/strong>&nbsp;An unnamed CIA analyst subsequently recalled that the United States had acquired &#8220;wonderful coverage, but\u2026didn&#8217;t get the pictures until the war was over.&#8221;<strong>2<\/strong>&nbsp;Even those photos showed the positions of invading forces only during the earliest part of the war.<strong>3<\/strong>&nbsp;The findings of the House Select Committee on Intelligence (the &#8220;Pike Committee&#8221;) in its recommendations to the Final Report in 1976 also indicate that the United States was unable to obtain adequate imagery and other information about the conflict while it was underway. As part of its criticism of US intelligence activities, the committee concluded that the United States had gone &#8220;to the brink of war&#8221; with the Soviet Union during the 1973 war because it lacked timely intelligence.<strong>4<\/strong><\/div>\n<div style=\"line-height:1.5em;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"line-height:1.5em;\"><strong>Israeli Dissatisfaction<\/strong><\/div>\n<div style=\"line-height:1.5em;\">If the United States was unable to obtain the satellite photography necessary to satisfy its own intelligence needs during the conflict, then it logically follows that it was likewise unable to provide any information derived from satellite intelligence to Israel. Faced with the possibility of imminent military defeat at the hands of enemies whose avowed purpose in past conflicts had been the total annihilation of the so-called Zionist entity, however, the Israelis were distrustful of US statements that it was unable to respond with desperately needed intelligence assistance. As Gur noted in 1992, &#8220;How could I know if [the satellite] was really damaged? The bottom line was that we didn&#8217;t get the information.&#8221;<\/div>\n<div style=\"line-height:1.5em;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"line-height:1.5em;\">from&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cia.gov%2Flibrary%2Fcenter-for-the-study-of-intelligence%2Fkent-csi%2Fvol44no5%2Fhtml%2Fv44i5a04p.htm&amp;h=kAQHG_Y2n&amp;s=1\" rel=\"nofollow\" style=\"color:#3b5998;cursor:pointer;text-decoration:initial;\" target=\"_blank\">https:\/\/www.cia.gov\/library\/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence\/kent-csi\/vol44no5\/html\/v44i5a04p.htm<\/a><\/div>\n<\/blockquote>\n<div style=\"background-color:white;color:#333333;font-family:'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif;font-size:10.909090995789px;line-height:16.5px;text-align:left;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"background-color:white;color:#333333;font-family:'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif;font-size:10.909090995789px;line-height:16.5px;text-align:left;\">So tell me, did Casey Marie Anderson do it? &nbsp;Should the CIA have told us?<\/div>\n<div style=\"background-color:white;color:#333333;font-family:'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif;font-size:10.909090995789px;line-height:16.5px;text-align:left;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"background-color:white;color:#333333;font-family:'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif;font-size:10.909090995789px;line-height:16.5px;text-align:left;\">What about you, if your child goes missing,&nbsp;<strong>would you want the &#8220;Agency&#8221; to help you find them?<\/strong><\/div>\n<div style=\"background-color:white;color:#333333;font-family:'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif;font-size:10.909090995789px;line-height:16.5px;text-align:left;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"background-color:white;color:#333333;font-family:'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif;font-size:10.909090995789px;line-height:16.5px;text-align:left;\"><strong>How many abduction cases are there every year?&nbsp;<\/strong><\/div>\n<\/div>\n","thumbnail_url":"https:\/\/i2.wp.com\/fbcdn-photos-a.akamaihd.net\/hphotos-ak-prn1\/545231_213330765470839_954284072_a.jpg?fit=440%2C330&ssl=1","thumbnail_width":null,"thumbnail_height":null}
