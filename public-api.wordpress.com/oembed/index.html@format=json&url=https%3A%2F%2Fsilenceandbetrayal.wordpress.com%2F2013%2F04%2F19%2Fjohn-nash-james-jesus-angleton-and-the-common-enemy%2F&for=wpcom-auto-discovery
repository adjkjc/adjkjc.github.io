Golitsyn convinced him that the KGB had reorganized in 1958 and <b>1959<\/b> to consist mostly of a shell, incorporating only those agents whom the CIA and the FBI were recruiting, directed by a small cabal of puppet masters who doubled those agents to manipulate their Western counterparts.&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"background-color:white;line-height:19.190340042114px;text-align:start;\">DCI&nbsp;<\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/William_Colby\" style=\"background-color:white;background-image:none;color:#0b0080;line-height:19.190340042114px;text-align:start;text-decoration:none;\" title=\"William Colby\">William Colby<\/a><span style=\"background-color:white;line-height:19.190340042114px;text-align:start;\">&nbsp;reorganized the CIA in an effort to curb Angleton&#8217;s influence, beginning by stripping him of control over the Israeli &#8220;account,&#8221; which had the effect of weakening counter-intelligence.
