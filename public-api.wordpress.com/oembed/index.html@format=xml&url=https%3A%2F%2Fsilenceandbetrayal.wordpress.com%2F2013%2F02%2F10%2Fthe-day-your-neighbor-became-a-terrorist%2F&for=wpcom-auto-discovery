<div style="text-align:justify;">Occupy, the &#8220;false flag&#8221; attack against peaceful protest. &nbsp;The Federal government is attempting to use this movement to silence dissidents, peaceful political protest, and destroy our Constitutional freedom to assemble. &nbsp;Your neighbors are not terrorists, they are concerned citizens, they are&nbsp;exercising&nbsp;their Constitutional rights. &nbsp;Lately, FBI internal leaks are showing an interest in this group that our country hasn&#8217;t seen since the Vietnam era.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">This is COINTELPRO, no if&#8217;s and&#8217;s or but&#8217;s. &nbsp;It is something that was done and supposedly stopped during the 70&#8217;s, and it is a manifestation of a government that is unwilling to hear the voice of it&#8217;s people. &nbsp;Back then, it lead to violence on the part of the government against peaceful protesters. &nbsp;Don&#8217;t let this happen again. &nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">In my eyes, the behavior of the FBI, and the &#8220;leaks&#8221; are an attempt to &#8220;Engineer Revolution,&#8221; or at least a non-peaceful attempt at it. Violence should always be used as a last resort, however when people are silenced in peaceful protest, it may lead them to act irrationally. It&#8217;s important that we stand up for, and <i>maintain our rights of peaceful protest without compromise</i>.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Government interference cannot be tolerated, if not only to keep the peace. &nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Escalation of violence, on the part of protesters <i style="font-weight:bold;">or</i>&nbsp;the government cannot be tolerated. &nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Labeling peaceful political groups as domestic terrorists brings us one step closer to 1984. &nbsp;</div>
<p>Take a step back.<br />We are looking through a tunnel at an &nbsp;oncoming train..</p>
