Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King, John Lennon, Ronald Reagan; and the result of these horrific actions was nothing but whitewashing by the Congressional investigations which followed. &nbsp;Ask yourselves why? &nbsp;Possibly because the same technology being used to coerce these individuals into committing horrific crimes was also being used against the very people investigating them. &nbsp;This is our reality.<\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear:both;text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/silenceandbetrayal.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/02\/lepoulpe-copy1.gif\" style=\"clear:left;float:left;margin-bottom:1em;margin-right:1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"107\" src=\"https:\/\/silenceandbetrayal.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/02\/lepoulpe-copy.png?w=200&#038;h=107\" width=\"200\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;<span style=\"text-align:justify;\">This organization was once made up of a few, with broad sweeping connections into all facets of the&nbsp;bureaucracy&nbsp;which was spawned to manage the vast resources of the United States Government. &nbsp;It was once called <\/span><i style=\"text-align:justify;\">The Octopus<\/i><span style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;for this very reason, though today it is no longer made up of tentacles, as it has consumed the whole. &nbsp;Our government is in peril, and the corruption and evil which has given it its strength will one day be its undoing. &nbsp;Before you today, the machinations of Constitutional liberty are aflame. &nbsp;The Executive Branch has taken it upon itself, with no legal authority whatsoever, to make and pass law. &nbsp;The Judicial Branch and Legislative Branches have <\/span><b style=\"text-align:justify;\">failed<\/b><span style=\"text-align:justify;\">&nbsp;to check this broad sweeping abuse of power, as is their mandate, and are now complicit in the actual and apparent movement from a Constitutional Republic to a Fascist Empire. &nbsp; Today, the Constitution is no more than the opiate of the masses, something that is on display for you to see, as if it still protected you. &nbsp;<\/span><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"text-align:justify;\"><br \/><\/span><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\"><span style=\"text-align:justify;\">At the same time, the Supreme Court and <b>The People<\/b>&nbsp;have allowed for tragic abuses of civil rights since the tragedy. &nbsp;In the same of safety and security, the Constitutional rule of law has been suspended. &nbsp;What is before you is not the dysutopic vision of writers like Orwell and PKD and Alan Moore, it is much much worse. &nbsp;The <b>fingermen <\/b>and <b>thoughtpolice<\/b>&nbsp;do not exist, at least they are hidden from plain view.
