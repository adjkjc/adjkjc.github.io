<ol>
<li>Completely insane</li>
<li>Makes sense, but its far fetched.</li>
<li>Complete agreement</li>
</ol>
<div>Those that think it insane seem to be of the camp that there is a scientific explanation for anything, they are non believers, and make insulting remarks to &#8216;debunk&#8217; theories which basically are nothing more than pointing out synchronistic irregularities in history.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The arguments are very similar to the attacks that evolutionists would use against creationists, but completely the opposite. &nbsp; My use of scientific and historical evidence in the attempted explanation of &#8220;supernatural&#8221; events like <i>divine inspiration</i>&nbsp;and <i>demonic possession </i>are met with the same disbelief and ignorance creationists would use to defend their position. &nbsp;It is the use of science of the mind and human history which can assist to prove the existence of exo-human intervention, and I would think an attempt to explain these phenomenons with science would be met with at least inquiry by the &#8216;evolutionist&#8217;/scientific crowd. &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div>It is my firm belief that organized religion has been used for the last thousand or so years in order to suppress scientific evidence, including the <i>obvious</i>&nbsp;force of evolution on biological life. &nbsp;I think we have a similar enemy, attempting once again to hide scientific explanations for paranormal events which are well documented in our history and literature.&nbsp;</div>
