<div style="text-align:justify;"><i><a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2013/01/taxi-cab-confession.html">Still playing ball</a>? </i>I repeated it in my head, as I walked briskly out the door, intent on not being stuck in the same situation I had been, surrounded by people playing this nefarious game. &nbsp;<i>What&#8217;s the point, all these people.. </i>I hadn&#8217;t tried to visit the FBI again, but I was sure her &#8216;game&#8217; was about not complaining to the authorities. &nbsp;I walked outside, around the corner, and across the street&#8230; Noticing a small boutique hotel around the corner, I increased my pace &nbsp;and asked how much a night would be. &nbsp;&#8220;No rooms available tonight,&#8221; &nbsp;<i>Of course not.</i>&nbsp; Feeling railroaded.. I thought that maybe if I did &#8216;play ball,&#8217; I could end this hellish &nbsp;experience, feeling bold and armed with the new idea of attacking them on their own turf, I walked back in to the Marriott on Atlantic Ave.</div>

<blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align:justify;"><p>This was <b>street theater</b>, but I didn&#8217;t know it yet. &nbsp;Strangers having staged conversations around you, with the sole intent of you hearing. &nbsp;Their conversations often included personal details from your life that they should have no knowledge of, or communicated a message to you. &nbsp;Alerting you to their constant presence, it serves to create the illusion of paranoia, one of the prime reasons for the attack. &nbsp;The attack works, and it&#8217;s been used for decades against honest victims, like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Jesus_Angleton">James Jesus Angleton</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://warofmoles.blogspot.com/2011/09/james-jesus-angleton-reconsidered.html">too close</a> to <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol53no4/201ccunning-passages-contrived-corridors201d.html">the truth</a>. <span style="font-size:xx-small;">(tm)</span></p></blockquote>
<div style="text-align:justify;">I walked back in through the restaurant on the left side of the building, it was under construction. &nbsp;Unsure of whether or not I was doing the right thing, I slowly walked towards the front desk, I had received intimidating threats.. suggestions that I might be thrown from a balcony, as I re-affirmed my decision to stay at that hotel, I decided I would only stay on the first floor, just to be safe. &nbsp;&#8220;Any rooms available?&#8221; &nbsp;I asked, knowing full well the answer would be yes. &nbsp;&#8220;We have one ground floor room by the spa,&#8221; the clerk replied, without me even asking. &nbsp;&#8220;Perfect.&#8221;</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">I paid for two nights, thinking my girlfriend would join me, especially if I enticed her with the spa on the&nbsp;premises, and took the electronic key card and started walking towards the room. &nbsp;The blonde couple had been in the shadows behind me the entire time, and as I walked away, the woman made another comment, &#8220;did you even have to pay?&#8221;</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">I found the room, slipped the electronic key in to the door, and as I was walking in I overheard a voice, &#8220;he&#8217;s not going to be happy when he see&#8217;s the door.&#8221; &nbsp;I walked in and immediately surveyed the room, the first thing I notice is the glass sliding door, facing the parking lot is slightly ajar, and has no lock on it. &nbsp;<i>Wonderful&#8230; </i>Turning around and placing my book bag on the bed, I notice that the smoke detector is hanging off the wall it had been mounted on, pointed towards the room. &nbsp;<i>Found one camera.</i>&nbsp; I immediately stood up on the bed, thought about ripping it down and taking it for evidence.. <i>ball game</i>.. I placed the smoke detector back on its mount, and rotated it, locking it in place.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Afterwords, I decided to browse back to <a href="http://myfreecams.com/">myfreecams.com</a> to see if the <b>weirdness </b>was still there. &nbsp;Instantly after joining a room: &#8220;wow, where are you now?&#8221; &nbsp;I&#8217;ve got to be honest, I&#8217;m a little excited now, I&#8217;d pretty much decided this was an elaborate joke, and the whole thing was starting to be a little bit more.. fun. &nbsp;At least that&#8217;s how I felt right at that moment. &nbsp;Getting back to business, you know, trying to stop these very skilled hackers from being able to monitor my whereabouts using my cellular phone, I decided to upgrade to <a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.org/">cyanogenmod</a>, leaving MFC in the background. &nbsp;I&#8217;ve done this many, many times, so in about 2 minutes I have the ROM downloaded, and I&#8217;m flashing.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">From nowhere, I hear a voice.. &#8220;what&#8217;s wrong with this thing.. I can&#8217;t see him anymore.. anybody else having a problem with the phone?&#8221; &nbsp;<i>My phone camera.</i>&nbsp; Honestly, hadn&#8217;t even thought of it, but given the last surveillance device I had dealt with, it made <b>a lot</b>&nbsp;of sense. &nbsp;I also apparently just found out that there are multiple camera&#8217;s on this strange system.</div>
<blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align:justify;"><p>Note to victims reading: &nbsp;Just like <b>street theater</b>, the camera story is designed to induce the appearance of insanity. &nbsp;The camera&#8217;s aren&#8217;t really there, not in your phone, not in your TV, and there aren&#8217;t people watching you all over the world, I promise. (It&#8217;s <a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2012/11/the-carnivore-conspiracy.html">just the NSA</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2012/12/occams-razor.html">friends</a>) &nbsp;The psychological abuse however, <i>is real</i>, and there are real people trying very hard to make you think you are being watched. &nbsp;They&#8217;re probably doing a pretty good job, too.</p></blockquote>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Feeling reassured that I had shut down all of the illicit surveillance, I called my girlfriend, who did not answer the phone, <b>again.</b>&nbsp; Time for some desperate measures, I phoned her best friend.&nbsp;</div>
