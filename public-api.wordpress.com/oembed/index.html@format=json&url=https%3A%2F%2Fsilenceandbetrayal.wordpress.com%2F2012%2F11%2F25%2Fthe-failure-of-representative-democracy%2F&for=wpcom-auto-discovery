The Constitution was meant to be a living document, to grow and change with our society and its advancement, to usher in a new world of self-rule where the voice of the people was the final word.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom:0;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom:0;\"><span style=\"color:black;\"><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\">Today, this same system is failing. Representative democracy has failed to evolve with our society and technological advancement, and now serves no purposes greater than to insulate the people from the process of governance.  It&#8217;s sprawling in<span lang=\"en-US\">efficient bureaucracy has become the equivalent of Marx&#8217;s opiate of the masses, placating your desire for freedom and justice, and replacing it with the false impression of holding a voice that matters.  <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom:0;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom:0;\"><span style=\"color:black;\"><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">In a time when your voice <\/span><span lang=\"en-US\"><i>could, and should<\/i><\/span><span lang=\"en-US\"><i><b><\/b><\/i><\/span><span lang=\"en-US\">be heard, you are instead inundated with a news and media weapon which covers the machinations of election more than the will of the people.  Four years ago, Barrack Obama promised us <\/span><span lang=\"en-US\"><i>change,<\/i><\/span><span lang=\"en-US\">and change we did get.   Unfortunately the change we got was an increase in the destruction of Constitutional Liberties, an increase in spending without oversight, and an increase in conflict around the world.  These changes serve to benefit a small minority, one bent on perpetual war in order to falsely inflate our economy, and to steal valuable resources from innocent nations around the world. <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom:0;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom:0;\"><span style=\"color:black;\"><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">These changes have taken your privacy from you, almost unilaterally, in your home, from your communications, and on the internet.  They have taken from you a media which once served the purpose of investigating government corruption and correcting wrongs in the world, to one which serves no purpose other than to rubber stamp governmental programs which would <\/span><span lang=\"en-US\"><i>never<\/i><\/span><span lang=\"en-US\"><i><\/i><\/span><span lang=\"en-US\">have been allowed to exist twenty years ago.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom:0;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom:0;\"><span style=\"color:black;\"><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">The great advances in our technology have done nothing to increase your representation in government.  Instead of allowing you to vote for important legislation online, now your private emails and data will be opened to secretive organizations with no legislative oversight or mandate for existence.  Instead of opening government data and information to the people, you are given the FOIA, which is routinely ignored by all members of the Executive Branch \u2013 \u201copenness in America\u201d is nothing more than another drug used to silence your conscience.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom:0;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom:0;\"><span style=\"color:black;\"><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">Democracy is failing, not because it&#8217;s a bad idea, but because the people in charge of <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><span style=\"color:black;\"><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\"><i>changing<\/i><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><span style=\"color:black;\"><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">and <\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><span style=\"color:black;\"><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\"><i>evolving it <\/i><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><span style=\"color:black;\"><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">have had their power taken from them.  The United States Congress has been systematically having its legislative power removed from it by the Office of the President of the United States of America since 2001, in plain view.  The treasonous acts of George W. Bush&#8217;s broad sweeping overuse of the Executive Order in order to legislate has not been checked by the removal of a neo-conservative from office, rather it has been perpetuated and made worse.  This abuse destroys the protections afforded by the Constitution, and removes your voice from governance further. &nbsp;It is the sole purpose of the legislative branch to create law, the laws the People need and desire. &nbsp;<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom:0;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom:0;\"><span style=\"color:black;\"><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">To the Congress of the United States, to The People, and to the Media:<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom:0;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom:0;\"><span style=\"color:black;\"><span style=\"font-family:Times New Roman;\"><span style=\"font-size:medium;\"><span lang=\"en-US\">Why have you ignored your loss of Liberty?<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom:0;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"margin-bottom:0;\">Do you <a href=\"http:\/\/unduecoercion.blogspot.com\/2012\/10\/how-stupid-are-you.html\">even<\/a> <a href=\"http:\/\/unduecoercion.blogspot.com\/2012\/11\/nobody-is-mind-controlling-me.html\">know<\/a>?<\/div>\n"}
