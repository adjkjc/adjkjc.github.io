<blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align:justify;"><p>I had a very strange experience in a taxi a few weeks prior, so I was attempting to avoid getting one that was <b>on the payroll,</b>&nbsp;as I called the people who were somehow associated with the large group of people acting strangely around me for the last few months. &nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">I&nbsp;walked in to a restaurant, sat down and had a cup of coffee, and requested that the waitress call a cab for me, thinking that this would avoid whatever listening device had been placed in the software of my cell phone. &nbsp;The cab came about thirty minutes later, a long wait in the area I was in, and I jumped in and asked him to take me to the Extended Stay America in Palm Beach.</div>
<div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">The cab driver was Jamaican, asked me how I was doing in, and put on some music. &nbsp;Everything seemed normal, apparently my evasive maneuvers had worked. &nbsp;Feeling relieved, I called my girlfriend again to see if she wanted me to stop by and pick her up on the way to the hotel. &nbsp;This time she answered the phone, and during the conversation, I overheard a train in the background. &nbsp;The only person I knew of that she knew who lived near train tracks was her ex, and cringed inside. &nbsp;She told me she might come to the hotel in a few hours, and barely made small talk before telling me her cell phone battery was low and she&#8217;d have to call me back. &nbsp;<i>Great</i>.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">A bit more agitated now, I rolled own my window in the rear of the cab, and asked the driver if he minded if I smoked a cigarette&#8230; he said no. &nbsp;I slouched a bit in the chair, thinking about the <a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2013/01/now-you-know.html">strange events</a> of the <a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2013/01/the-morning-star.html">previous night</a>. &nbsp;<i>It&#8217;s just not true. &nbsp;</i>I thought about who would have access to the exploits that would be required to access a webcam on a machine not connected to a network, the kind of people I had read about in <a href="http://manybooks.net/titles/dakanrother07Geek_Mafia.html">Geek Mafia</a>, by Rick Dakkan&#8230; or maybe an intelligence agency &#8212; certainly nothing I had ever read of law enforcement (state of federal) being able to accomplish. &nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">We were exiting I-95, heading towards Congress where the hotel was. &nbsp;Suddenly, the driver rolled up my window, and said he was going to put on the air conditioning. &nbsp;I didn&#8217;t object, and looked out the window for the hotel, which was supposed to be right off the highway. &nbsp;Neither of us saw it, and we circled around one more time before I asked him to drive east towards the beach, thinking that might entice my girlfriend to join me later. &nbsp;Driving east, the driver began pressing buttons somewhere out of view, I could tell because of the strange chimes that each button press echoed in my ear. &nbsp;I was alerted to his center console, and noticed that the normal GUI interface had been replaced with a high contrast text interface. &nbsp;I could not read it.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Seconds later, the air went full bast, it was a&nbsp;noticeable&nbsp;change in sound, and I looked around the cab. &nbsp;Tiny white particles were flying around in the air, and stuck when the hit front of my eye glasses. &nbsp;I whirled inside, thoughts of the set up my girlfriend had warned me about focused clearly in my mind&#8217;s eye. &nbsp;&#8220;<i>They&#8221; are drugging me..</i>&nbsp;it was almost exactly like the last time this happened, and I immediately told the driver to stop at the first hotel he could find. &nbsp;I was so anxious that I did not even know where I was. &nbsp;I attempted to roll down the window, to get fresh air, and it had been locked. &nbsp;&#8220;Please roll my window down.. &#8221; I grunted at the driver. &nbsp;He complied, just as he was pulling in to the parking lot of a Marriot hotel right on the beach. &nbsp;I jumped out of the car immediately, grabbing my backpack and walked around to the driver side. &nbsp;I didn&#8217;t feel any different, <i>what on Earth could these people be thinking, so brazen. &nbsp;</i>I paid the driver a large tip, almost twenty dollars, relieved that he had both rolled the window down and stopped quickly. <i>&nbsp;Maybe disaster had been averted</i>, since I had noticed what was going on.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">I walked in to the hotel to book a room, and as I walked towards the front desk, a blonde man standing with his wife and speaking to the clerk said, &#8220;Here he is now.&#8221; &nbsp;He looked directly at me.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Enraged, I immediately turned around, <i>the cab driver must have brought me here on purpose</i>, my heart sank, and I began walking towards the door. &nbsp;A mind control alert followed, and I heard his companion say &#8220;he&#8217;s still playing ball, right?&#8221;</div>
