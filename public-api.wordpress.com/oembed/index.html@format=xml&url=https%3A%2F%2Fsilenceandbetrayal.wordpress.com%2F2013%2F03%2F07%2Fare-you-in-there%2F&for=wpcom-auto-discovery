<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">I stood up and walked over to her, looked into her eyes and asked her if she was in there. &nbsp;She looked startled.. and responded &#8220;How can you tell?&#8221; &nbsp;<i>You never talk like this, I&#8217;ve known you for a long time.</i>&nbsp; I told her the conversation seemed strange to me, and began wondering if she was somehow being possessed by a third party. &nbsp;Then she told me that she was communicating with someone, using a covert transmitter that had been implanted in her tooth, a dental filling. &nbsp;<i>Now I really know it&#8217;s not you.</i>&nbsp; Mary was very non-technically oriented, words and phrases like &#8220;covert transmitter&#8221; would never have come out of her mouth. &nbsp;She went on, walked over to the clock radio, and said that it works over the airwaves. &nbsp;Internally, my mind clarified what she was talking about. &nbsp;I imagined a system where the radio stations were being used to broadcast encrypted messages which were decoded by some sort of in hardware encrypted audio device. &nbsp;In a cascade, more things began clicking. &nbsp;All her talk about laser eavesdropping and cell phones being used had been to cover up that she had a listening device implanted in her dental filling the whole time, a kind of misdirection. &nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Shortly after, Mary began crying uncontrollably. &nbsp;At one point she screamed &#8220;No, why?&#8221; &nbsp;It was clear she was communicating with this third party, who she later identified to be a &#8220;distant family member.&#8221; &nbsp;I had no idea what the conversation was about, but it was clear that she was genuinely sad and frightened. &nbsp;After five or so minutes of non-stop crying she looked up at me. &nbsp;She began relaying messages directly from the third party communicating with her, she told me that &#8220;they&#8221; had said they &#8220;had to set me up,&#8221; and there was nothing we could do to avoid it. &nbsp;Except run.</div>
<blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align:justify;"><p><a href="https://silenceandbetrayal.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/agentinplace2.png" style="clear:right;float:right;margin-bottom:1em;margin-left:1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="https://silenceandbetrayal.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/agentinplace.png?w=143&#038;h=200" width="143" /></a>This night was used to plant the idea of OSEH/mindwar perpetrators communicating with covert implanted devices. &nbsp;I would later realize that this also, was just another layer of deception being used to hide the actual method of communication &#8212; a direct neural link. &nbsp;It was central to the psychological abuse I was a victim of, as I was later made to believe that me, and a very small group of fellow victims were actually unwitting test subjects in a government experiment. &nbsp;Had I known that the perpetrator agents were also being mind controlled, it would have been clear that this was a deception. &nbsp;For a very long time, I believed Mary had a special Illuminati communication device which was used in order to facilitate criminal operations, like drug trafficking and gang-stalking itself.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align:justify;"><p>In the significant research I later did into the technology involved, I would at one point think the radio transmitter was akin to &#8220;The Thing&#8221; a covert soviet listening device which did not require a power source. &nbsp;Even later, I would read and learn about transmitters which could be powered by remote microwave, and also surface&nbsp;acoustic&nbsp;wave devices. &nbsp;This is how mind control works, by planting an idea in the minds of victims, and then reinforcing it with real world &#8220;props&#8221; like newspaper articles, scientific research, and even patents.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Mary continued to tell me that they had to set me up because I had witnessed something, but she didn&#8217;t say what it was, and at the time I really had no idea. &nbsp;She continued having a noticeable conversation with this third party, in which I could only hear her half of the conversation, which she spoke aloud. &nbsp;She seemed to be arguing with them, attempting to find some sort of alternate solution. &nbsp;Near the end she looked up and said, &#8220;they say that we can&#8217;t go back to the car, if we do they will kill you.&#8221;</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">She said she would come with me, and help protect me, and I wanted nothing more than to stay with her. &nbsp;We went the next morning to the store, and bought a significant amount of prepaid credit cards, cell phone cards, and food cards so our purchases could not be tracked. &nbsp;We really had no idea what we were doing, but the entire thing seemed so surreal that I felt like my actions were forced. &nbsp; Mary suggested sending her money, which at the time seemed reasonable, and I wired her 10,000 into her personal account. &nbsp;We rented a car in her name, and began driving, destination unknown.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">I imagine at this point reality returned, and having no place to go and frankly no reason to be going, I told Mary there must be something else we can do. &nbsp;I suggested going back to her grandparents house and trying to convince them to stop whatever it was that was going on. &nbsp;She paused before answering, and I imagined that she was receiving a communication&#8230; &#8220;that&#8217;s a good idea,&#8221; she said, &#8220;I think they want to help you.&#8221;</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Now, with a destination, purpose, and hope to escape from this fate, we set out to return to Ocala.</div>
