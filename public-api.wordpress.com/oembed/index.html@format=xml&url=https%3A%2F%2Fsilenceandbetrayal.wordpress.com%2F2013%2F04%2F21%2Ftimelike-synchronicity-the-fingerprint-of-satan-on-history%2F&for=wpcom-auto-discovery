<div style="text-align:justify;"><b>Timelike Synchronicity:&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;</div>
<blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align:justify;"><p>Synchronicity is the experience of two or more events that are apparently causally unrelated or unlikely to occur together by chance, yet are experienced as occurring together in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meaning_(non-linguistic)">meaningful</a> manner. The concept of synchronicity was first described in this terminology by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung">Carl Gustav Jung</a>, a Swiss psychologist, in the 1920s.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-1"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synchronicity#cite_note-1" style="background-image:none;color:#0b0080;font-family:sans-serif;line-height:1em;text-decoration:none;white-space:nowrap;">[1]</a></sup>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align:justify;"><p><a href="http://phys.org/news/2011-01-physicists-method-timelike-entanglement.html">Timelike Entanglement</a>: is the connection, via <b>quantum entanglement</b>, through time. &nbsp;It is described in <a href="http://phys.org/news/2011-01-physicists-method-timelike-entanglement.html">this article</a>, and clearly states that it revolves around a pattern of equidistant time periods between events.</p></blockquote>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Taken together, these things form <b>timelike synchronicity</b>, which is the linking of two or more events which are&nbsp;<i>casually related</i>, though the relation is not apparent in anything more than their general theme, though the connection implicates the influence of an intelligent external force in the group of events.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">These patterns are defined and explained in the following articles:</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2013/04/timelike-entanglement-synchronicity-and.html"><b>1984</b>, Orwell and Huxley</a>, along with the <a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2013/02/silence-is-freedom-tyranny-is-security.html">reason it&#8217;s related</a>.</div>

<div style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2013/04/john-nash-james-jesus-angleton-and.html">Schizophrenia, John Nash, James Angleton, and James Tilly Matthews</a>, and <a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2013/04/schizophrenia-is-alien-weapon-against.html">the reason</a>.</p>
<p>Just to highlight how pivotal the above events are to our modern time, and the 20th century: &nbsp;It&#8217;s probably pertinent to point out that <b>every single one</b>&nbsp;has had a major motion picture created about it in the last 20 years.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">In an attempt to prove that this pattern is <i>highly statistically improbable,</i><b style="font-style:italic;">&nbsp;</b>I have done a cursory search using what I believed to be an innocuous unrelated event, the election of several randomly selected President&#8217;s of the United States. &nbsp;This attempt, using<b> Lyndon Johnson, Gerald Ford, and Jimmy Carter</b> yielded zero <b>timelike synchronicities</b> between the three President&#8217;s. &nbsp;One, Lyndon Johnson, had a single midpoint correlation to his Presidency in his lifetime at 1950. &nbsp;<i>Not coincidentally, Johnson has been implicated in the assassination of John F. Kennedy.</i>&nbsp; Ignoring the possibility that Johnson should be removed because of his relationship to JFK, and allowing it to stand, this&nbsp;exercise yields a statistical probability of of <b>1 in 9</b> for the existence of Timelike Synchronicity without a relationship. &nbsp;Using the most broad definition, and expanding this with just the list above, the (roughly estimated) statistical probability of these events all having a <b>timelike synchronicity</b> is <b>0.137%</b>. &nbsp;I will be attempting to lower this number, and make it more accurate, in the future.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">It should be noted that the events noted above have been the focus of my investigation into the influence of this force on our modern history, and of those events nearly all of them include timelike synchronicities. &nbsp;I had previously written about all of these events <i>prior</i>&nbsp;to finding the pattern, and have found it in every single instance I have looked.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">While my cursory attempt to prove the significance of the correlation is small, it does show that the phenomenon of timelike synchronicity is not the kind of pattern that can be found &#8220;anywhere;&#8221; but is rather a highly unlikely pattern which points to the <b>influence of an outside force in many pivotal affairs of our modern times</b>.</div>
