<blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align:justify;"><p>This is one of the events that has stuck clearly in my memory throughout this ordeal. &nbsp;Similar to my searches on the internet for the technology and corruption responsible for gang-stalking, my search related to this was clearly directed. &nbsp;It wasn&#8217;t that significant of a thing to have merited the half hour dedicated to it a few days later, but it brought me directly to the Holy Bible.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq"><p><span style="background-color:#fffefd;color:#001320;line-height:21px;text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:inherit;"><i>And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your offspring and hers; he will crush your head, and you will strike his heel.</i>&nbsp; Genesis 3:15</span></span>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align:justify;"><p>When I read it, the words spoke to me. &nbsp;I <i>knew</i>&nbsp;it was meant to explain why she did what she did, and I also realized, that like much of the gang-stalking street theater, it was meant to convey a message to me. &nbsp;The idea of Satan being involved in what was happening had occurred, along with demons, evil spirits, and aliens. &nbsp;I put them out of my mind. &nbsp;I had to remain grounded, and that is what I did. &nbsp; <b>Remain grounded </b>had been a repeated phrase in my mind during this time, and while I recognized the possibilities, I was almost ashamed that I had previously given so much credence to the possibility of the preternatural being involved.</p></blockquote>
<div style="text-align:justify;">We saw headlights through the large window in our living room, it was very late. &nbsp;I crept down further to see that it was my friends pickup truck, and we walked towards the door. &nbsp;I stopped in front of it and told Mary that I would go out first, and she should follow directly behind me. &nbsp;I opened the door, and walked a few steps outside, instantly feeling relieved. &nbsp;We made it in to the truck, and my friend asked where we were going. &nbsp;At that instant, out of the corner of my eye, I saw the cab, sitting in the lot, parked so it had a clear view of our front door. &nbsp;Its lights turned on and it drove off, almost instantly.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">The initial spike of fear that came when I saw it dissipated quickly, as now we would not be followed. &nbsp;I asked to be dropped off at my parents, only a few miles away, and we said very little for the rest of the ride. &nbsp;We entered my parents house, went directly to my room, and I let out a final sigh of relief before it happened.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Mary was sitting on my bed, her bare legs touching the ground, leaning back slightly. &nbsp;I stood near the door, and in my inner voice, the thoughts in my mind, <i>I hope we make it back to Charleston, I can&#8217;t take much more of this.</i></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><i><br /></i></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;I hope we make it back to Charleston, I can&#8217;t take much more of this.&#8221; &nbsp;<b>Mary repeated, out loud</b>. &nbsp;Numerous times over the past weeks, she had intimated that the mafia related organization responsible for our plight had the ability to read thoughts. &nbsp;</div>
<blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align:justify;"><p>Thinking back on it, it had been proven to me many times, but never in such an overt manner &#8212; I had always dismissed it as trickery and deception. &nbsp;Now, with proof beyond a reasonable doubt, I was filled with joy&#8230; the fact that I was witnessing something supernatural, something I never thought to be possible made me&nbsp;ecstatic..&nbsp;&nbsp;further reflection, and much more experience with <b>mind control</b>&nbsp;in the coming years would yield the truth to me, that my emotional response was scripted &#8212; directed by someone else &#8212; just as the words I was thinking during this time were.</p></blockquote>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><i>That&#8217;s the coolest thing ever. &nbsp;</i>Again, she repeated, &#8220;That&#8217;s the coolest thing ever.&#8221;</div>
<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><i>How are you doing it? &nbsp;</i>Repeated again.</div>
