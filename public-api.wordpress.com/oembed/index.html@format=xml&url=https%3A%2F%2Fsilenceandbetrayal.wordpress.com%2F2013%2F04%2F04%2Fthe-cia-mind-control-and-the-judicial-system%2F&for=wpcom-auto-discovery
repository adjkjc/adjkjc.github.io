<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"><a href="https://silenceandbetrayal.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/president-john-f-kennedy2.jpg" style="clear:left;float:left;margin-bottom:1em;margin-right:1em;"><img border="0" height="157" src="https://silenceandbetrayal.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/president-john-f-kennedy.jpg?w=200&#038;h=157" width="200" /></a></div>
<p><span style="font-family:inherit;">The assassination of John F. Kennedy is one of the most pivotal moments in American history.  There are tales of visual hallucinations on the part of by standards and officers of the law, which give credence to the idea that mind control technology was utilized during the assassination.  It has been speculated that Oswald himself was a mind control victim, and his quick murder after the assassination certainly should leave doubt in the minds of anyone that he was the lone gunman.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:inherit;"><br /></span></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:inherit;">Prior to the&nbsp;assassination&nbsp; a serviceman stationed with Oswald in Japan wrote a fictional novel, loosely based on his and Oswald&#8217;s experiences.  The novel, The Idle Warriors, detailed MK-Ultra like experimentation including unknowing LSD administration.  Thornley, the author testified at the Warren Commission regarding his and Oswald&#8217;s link to the CIA program.  He was charged with perjury, a charge that was later dropped.  Some believe Thornley&#8217;s later mental illness was due to <a href="http://kerrythornley.com/misc/mkultra.html">drug experimentation</a> conducted on members of the military including Oswald. Others suspect being linked to the assassination contributed to his paranoia.  In light of recent events however, it is significantly more likely that his later contraction of mental illness was itself mind control induced, in order to discredit the testimony he gave in his later book, Oswald, as well as that given to the Warren Commission.</span></div>
<blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align:justify;"><p><span style="font-family:inherit;"><span style="background-color:white;line-height:19.184028625488px;">At the trial, the prosecution sought to have entered into evidence a fingerprint card with Clay Shaw&#8217;s signature on it and, which also had on it, Shaw&#8217;s admission that he had used the alias &#8220;Clay Bertrand.&#8221; In regard to this, Judge Edward Haggerty, after dismissing the jury, conducted a day long hearing, in which he ruled the fingerprint card inadmissible. He said that two policemen had violated Shaw&#8217;s constitutional rights by not permitting the defendant to have his lawyer present during the fingerprinting. Judge Haggerty also announced that Officer Habighorst had violated&nbsp;</span><i style="background-color:white;line-height:19.184028625488px;"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miranda_v._Arizona" style="background-image:none;background-position:initial initial;background-repeat:initial initial;color:#0b0080;text-decoration:none;" title="Miranda v.

The judge said that Habighorst had violated Shaw&#8217;s rights by allegedly questioning him about an alias, adding, &#8220;Even if he did [ask the question about an alias] it is not admissible.&#8221; Judge Haggerty exclaimed, &#8220;If Officer Habighorst is telling the truth — and I seriously doubt it!&#8221; The judge finished with the statement, &#8220;I do not believe Officer Habighorst!&#8221;</span><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-36" style="background-color:white;line-height:1em;"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trial_of_Clay_Shaw#cite_note-36" style="background-image:none;color:#0b0080;text-decoration:none;white-space:nowrap;">[36]</a></sup></span></p></blockquote>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:inherit;">The judges actions in this case scream of mind control &#8212; not only that, but the fact that these statements have been recorded and repeated, left not only in the written court record, but all over the internet; shows that some entity wanted to make an example out of this case. &nbsp;An exclamation that he simply did not believe an Officer of the law, for what amounts to no reason whatsoever (especially considering he had black and white evidence, in the form of a signature card) shows that he was either complicit in the cover up of the&nbsp;assassination&nbsp;conspiracy, he was mind&nbsp;controlled&nbsp;&#8220;not to believe the evidence,&#8221; or both.</span></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:inherit;"><br /></span></div>
<p><span style="font-family:inherit;">Later in the trial, both CIA and mind control tactics would reveal themselves as a significant part of both the defense, as well as the mechanism which destroyed its credibility. &nbsp;</span></p>

<div style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:inherit;">The ability to cause multiple governors not to honor extradition requests, as well as to practically disappear a possible witness until after the trial is most likely outside the normal powers of the CIA.

<div style="text-align:justify;">According to Pete Brewton’s book, <i><b>The Mafia, CIA and George Bush</b></i> [1992, Shapolsky Publishers, p. 193-94], George DeMohrenschildt, a key subject of the Kennedy assassination by the House Select Committee on Assassinations in the late 1970s, was a White Russian count with extensive ties to the CIA who lived in Texas.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">DeMohrenschildt was associated with Clint Murchison’s meat-packing business and cattle ranches around Dallas according to Brewton; but more importantly, Congress found that DeMohrenschildt’s personal address book contained the name and Midland, Texas address of George H. W. Bush, providing additional evidence linking Bush 41 to events surrounding JFK’s death, covered up and watered down by the congressional committee to protect the future president and others.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Former President Bush has publicly stated he does not remember where he was on November 22, 1963, the day President Kenney was assassinated; and no prosecutor has interrogated him as to his ties to DeMohrenschildt and Murchison—part of Nixon’s “Texans.” &nbsp;Bush was later made director of the CIA, and Nixon, of course, was his father Prescott&#8217;s protege.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Prescott Bush was a known supporter of Hitler and the Nazi Party, there are newly discovered files in the US National Archives that a firm of which Prescott Bush was a director was involved with the financial architects of Nazism.  Further, he was associated with an attempted fascist coup, in conjunction with the DuPont and Carnegie families called the<b> Business Plot. &nbsp;</b>It seems these desires were never quenched, and in the wake of the JFK assassination, his son managed to take the office of President and crash the country into a deceptive global plot of cocaine trafficking and natural resources theft.</div>
</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">G.H.W. Bush himself has been linked to the scene:</div>
