<div style="text-align:justify;">I feel like I need to stop the story for a moment, and explain what&#8217;s going on. &nbsp;I have had several victims contact me asking questions, who seem to be going through a very similar situation right now. This tells me two things; first, what happened to me is more common place than I had previously thought. &nbsp;Second, I can&#8217;t make the story as fun as I thought it would become. &nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">My goal with telling the story the way I have been was to show you how my thought process changed throughout this ordeal. &nbsp;I wanted to make it very clear that <b>mind control</b>&nbsp;was responsible for distorting the truth, making me unaware of what was going on around me, and believe fanciful things. &nbsp;My intention was to make this surprising and suspenseful, not really making it obvious that my world-view was changing (even though I did tell you about <b>reality shifting</b>). &nbsp;The point, was to vicariously explain how you can be aware that your perceptions are being altered, while still being unaware that your changing realizations &#8212; how you perceive what is happening &#8212; is actually being directed by someone or something else. &nbsp;More clearly, my understanding of what was going on, which was my primary drive in &#8216;playing the game&#8217; of discovering how <i><b>mind control</b>&nbsp;worked</i>&nbsp;was, and still is, the mechanism through which my opponent was controlling me. &nbsp;Please be aware that most of this writing is told as if I were current experiencing what I am writing about, and I have tried to remain as true to my inner mindset as possible. &nbsp;Almost all of how I felt at the time is no longer valid. &nbsp;As I start finishing up the &#8220;Truman Show&#8221; portion, and move <i>back in time</i> towards the darker drug cartel and organized crime portion, you will begin to see not only the point of the Truman Show, but also how much I didn&#8217;t understand for so long.</div>
<blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align:justify;"><p>In certain instances, I have indented text, this is meant to be closer to my &#8220;current take&#8221; on what is going on. &nbsp;You might consider it similar to Fred Savage&#8217;s voice-over in <i style="font-weight:bold;">The Wonder Years, </i>or his grandfather&#8217;s voice in <i style="font-weight:bold;">The Princess Bride.</i>&nbsp; Just a little note on synchronicity and lack of coincidence here: &nbsp;it&#8217;s pretty funny that both of my examples point back to the same actor.</p></blockquote>
<div style="text-align:justify;">For those that are experiencing symptoms of what I am describing, you are in a much more dangerous situation than the current posts describe, please do not think I am taking what is happening to you lightly. &nbsp;I have written a letter to victims of &#8220;Mindwar,&#8221; as I call it, and hope you will read that. &nbsp; Beware, the people that are actively working to damage your credibility as a Federal witness, intimidate you into <i>not</i>&nbsp;testifying, and psychologically abuse you are <i style="font-weight:bold;">dangerous criminals.</i>&nbsp; Also please be aware that not everyone you <i>think</i>&nbsp;is &#8220;in on it&#8221; is.. one of the most difficult mechanisms of this attack to get through is the feeling that the entire world is out to get you. &nbsp;It&#8217;s definitely not. &nbsp;There are still good and loving people around you. &nbsp;Your family loves you. &nbsp;The world has not plunged into the depths of Hades yet, though it might be on the precipice.</div>
