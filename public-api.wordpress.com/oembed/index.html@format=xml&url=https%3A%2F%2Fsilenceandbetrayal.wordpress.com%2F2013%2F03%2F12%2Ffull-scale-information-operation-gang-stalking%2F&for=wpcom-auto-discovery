</div>
<div style="text-align:center;">&nbsp;&#8220;It&#8217;s because of me, and I will make them stop.&#8221;</div>
<blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align:justify;"><p>It was obvious, when you think about it, that the whole thing had been revolving around our reunion, and her family. &nbsp;It gave me a great sigh of relief that she had finally come clean, and I was eternally grateful to have finally gotten honesty from her &#8212; something I had always cherished about her. &nbsp;Unfortunately, this particular statement was only a half truth, if that, and what would ensue over the next month was anything but stopping. &nbsp;Over the next month, we would both be gang-stalked: &nbsp;followed from place to place being threatened by third parties, police officers, hotel clerks, and random strangers on the street. &nbsp;It was the most unsettling thing anyone could imagine, and its sole intent is to create the appearance of paranoia in its victims. &nbsp;After much research, it becomes clear that it is a military grade information operation, used by the mafia in order to discredit witnesses against their Octopus like tentacles stretching far and wide into the body of the United States government. &nbsp;Their network includes police in almost every jurisdiction in Florida, as well as judges, lawyers, and civilians all working feverishly to hide their very existence. &nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<div style="text-align:justify;">I fell asleep for about 2 or three hours, and was again woken to something very unsettling. &nbsp;Apparently Mary had left shortly after me dosing off, and when she returned she noticed she had locked herself out of our apartment. &nbsp;I had never known her to be very athletic, but she managed to <b>climb to the second floor</b>, and woke me up by sliding open the balcony door. &nbsp;I was shocked, and slightly amused at the contraption she had built, stringing together the dogs 20 foot standing leash with some other cords on the patio in order to get in the house. &nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">While she was gone, and I had been asleep, our puppy had apparently ripped open the dog bed that we had not brought to Ocala. &nbsp;The stuffing was strewn all over the house, between the stairs and the bottom floor. &nbsp;When we discovered it after her return, she was&nbsp;noticeably&nbsp;upset. &nbsp;In what would become one of many internet searches which would later be revealed to have been directed with the use of mind control technology, I began searching for the reason that this item had caused her so much distress over the last week. &nbsp;I found an article talking about organized crime using the very same item, a dog bed, in order to traffic cocaine.&nbsp;</div>
<blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align:justify;"><p>It all made sense, in a cascade of understanding, that we had avoided the real set up because of my unwillingness to bring the dog on the trip. &nbsp;I was later made to believe it was my keen inference of her distress that saved us, and then even later that it was some form of psychic intervention, that we were saved for an unknown reason. &nbsp;None of these things would prove to be true in the end, what it now seems like is manipulation of all parties involved, law enforcement the mafia, Mary and myself, in order to tell this story. &nbsp;Who would do such a thing? &nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<div style="text-align:justify;">I continued searching, this time for a mechanism which would enable drugs to be hidden inside the stuffing of the dog bed, and was quickly given an answer by &#8220;Google&#8221;. &nbsp;Almost instantly, several US Patents for doing just that, hiding illicit drugs inside cellulose fibers were shown to me. &nbsp;They&#8217;re still there, against any and all logical reason for such a thing to be patented&#8230; and filed with the government. &nbsp;</div>
<blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align:justify;"><p>Search results are just one of the electronic communications mechanisms which this entity can control. &nbsp;It has the ability to modify not only what comes up in the search, but also what is seen by the viewer. &nbsp;Even so far as being able to redirect cell phone calls, instant messages, and emails &#8212; it&#8217;s mastery of all things electronic would be shown to me over the next month and a half, but not make sense until much much later.</p></blockquote>
<div style="text-align:justify;">I questioned Mary about what I had found on the internet, and she looked at me sternly. &nbsp;Her response was out of the ordinary, as if it were not coming from her. &nbsp;The words were clearly a question, however her tone and demeanor were not&nbsp;quizzical: &#8220;How do you know?&#8221; &nbsp;It would later be clear that she was silently or covertly telling me that the entire search and discovery process had been directed, though I still do not know if she knew that was what she was doing.. to this day.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Mary began going around the house picking up the soft filling of the dog bed. &nbsp;She was placing it in publix bags, and setting them next to the door. &nbsp;I started helping her, and it seemed as if she thought that was odd, she then told me that &#8220;they&#8221; wanted it back. &nbsp;<i>Great, get it the fuck out of here.</i>&nbsp; I told her what I had thought, and she asked me if I would come with her to bring it to Damon.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><i>No. &nbsp;fucking. &nbsp;way.</i></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><i><br /></i></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">I said I&#8217;d be more than happy for her to take it, and that I would meet her after she did it. &nbsp;I wanted nothing to do with it, after repeated threats of being set up. &nbsp;Now that I knew what the issue was, I was going to stay as far away from it as possible. &nbsp;She received a communication over her &#8220;two way radio&#8221; and told me that if I wasn&#8217;t coming, she didn&#8217;t want to take it anywhere. &nbsp;I told her that it was going down the toilet then, and her eyes narrowed, angrily.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Seconds later she agreed that was the best thing to be doing, and I proceeded to flush all of the loose fibers down the toilet. &nbsp;I felt relieved that she had not argued with me, and that it was gone. &nbsp;Mary had been planning on having her mother over, we had talked about it on the drive home, and she called at almost the instant the toilet flushed.</div>
