This opinion is made in hindsight after quite a bit of analysis, and the actual psychological attack attempts relentlessly to create confusion and delusion as to both the &#8220;how,&#8221; &#8220;who,&#8221; and &#8220;why&#8221; of something that is so off-putting that it almost unanimously causes its victims to not only cry out at the top of their lungs, but seek out grounding in reality.<\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">When it first began happening to me, in November and December of 2010, I called it &#8220;reality shifting,&#8221; and I imagine it will be very hard to describe just how powerful it is, but I am going to try. &nbsp;OSEH is designed to use fear and intimidation in order to cause the victim to tell a story. &nbsp;It seems the reason for wanting them to tell the story is two-fold: &nbsp;1) the story that the victim winds up telling is not <i>true<\/i>, it&#8217;s what has been communicated to them using very sophisticated tools, like military grade information operations, and <i>mind control<\/i>&nbsp;technology &#8212; this is probably to discredit further testimony from these people, or at least keep it locked up in written record until it is &#8220;needed&#8221;. &nbsp;2) the second purpose of OSEH is to prove to the world, at some future time, that this technology was really being used for nefarious purposes, en masse, across the globe. &nbsp;As a victim, that&#8217;s obvious, because the use of this technology, its existence, and <i>some<\/i>&nbsp;of its capabilities are proven routinely. &nbsp;As an observer, however, it serves to instill a feeling of disbelief, giving you a <i>reason<\/i>&nbsp;to discard what would be otherwise valid testimony for a reason that doesn&#8217;t really hold water. &nbsp;The reason is that <i>none of the victims know exactly how it is happening, but most of them are almost positive that they do. &nbsp;<\/i>There is <i>so much<\/i>&nbsp;talk on the Internet from &#8220;Targeted Individuals&#8221; about <i>how<\/i>&nbsp;mind control works, that doesn&#8217;t make any scientific sense, that their claims are dismissed completely as delusion, when in fact the only delusion they have has been imparted to them using mind control.<i>&nbsp;<\/i>This is by design, and it is the crux of the psychological attack on the general public, that the victims are forced into committing&#8230; against themselves. &nbsp;It&#8217;s very hard to overcome for both sides.<\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">Once <i>mind control capability<\/i>&nbsp;has been proven to you, the normal response is to research exactly how this is happening, in order to stop it. &nbsp;This is another reason the internet is now littered with falsehoods about how it works, and the garbage that pervades the <i>mind control community<\/i>&nbsp;is there first and foremost so that knowing victims can do absolutely nothing about it, and second (in my belief) when awareness becomes more broad, that the entire world will have a very difficult time in figuring out how to stop it.<\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">Tomorrow I&#8217;m going to talk about how I first became aware of it, and that will probably seem like a very strange story to you, let me alert you in advance to the fact that its nothing anyone would <i>intentionally make up<\/i>, it will be the actual story that was told to me, and it&#8217;s somewhat comical.<\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">Today, I&#8217;m going to go through some of the &#8220;research&#8221; available on the internet about &#8220;how&#8221; mind control works, and tell you why I think it makes no sense.<\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.whale.to\/b\/nsa7.html#Capabilities_of_NSA_Operatives_Using_RNM_\">Microwave radiation used to control your mind<\/a><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/www.whale.to\/b\/nsa7.html#Capabilities_of_NSA_Operatives_Using_RNM_\">http:\/\/www.whale.to\/b\/nsa7.html#Capabilities_of_NSA_Operatives_Using_RNM_<\/a><\/div>\n<blockquote class=\"tr_bq\" style=\"text-align:justify;\"><p>One of the more often cited, and &#8220;more technological&#8221; looking articles, the above purports to tell victims that they are being influenced by low frequency microwaves, and that these have the &#8220;capability&#8221; of modifying thoughts, feelings, sight, sound etc. &nbsp;This is reinforced by numerous public articles on things like the Soviet &#8220;woodpecker&#8221; and psychotronics, which the intelligence community would have you believe they thought were attempts and modifying the U.S. population&#8217;s thoughts during the Cold War. &nbsp;It&#8217;s my belief that this was a very well planned and executed cover operation for technology that actually does work.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"tr_bq\" style=\"text-align:justify;\"><p>&nbsp;If you look into neuroscience research, and how the brain actually works, it&#8217;s pretty clear that thoughts and feelings are products of electrical impulses.. the firing of neurons, and how these neurons connect to other neurons, like a very advanced biological integrated circuit. &nbsp;The idea that these impulses can be significantly modified with radio frequency radiation is pretty silly. &nbsp;It&#8217;s even more silly when you realize that in order to change something like a thought, it would require the complex modification of the firing of <i>many very small neurons <\/i>in a very specific pattern, it would require that neurons surrounding the ones intending to be fired did not accidentally fire, and it would have to be sustained &#8230; indefinitely in order to create the effect that I will be describing. &nbsp;It&#8217;s just not possible to create a <i>mini-EMP<\/i>&nbsp;that satisfies these requirements.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"tr_bq\" style=\"text-align:justify;\"><p>When you throw in that a great number of victims, myself included, worked feverishly to create electromagnetic shielding in order to <i>stop mind control<\/i>, it becomes even more apparent that this is not the product of radio frequency. &nbsp;Once you figure out that something strange is happening to you, and you &#8220;find&#8221; the TI community, this is one of the first things you see, and it leads you in the wrong direction, sometimes indefinitely.&nbsp;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Covert implants by <a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Alien_implants\">aliens<\/a>, the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thetruthdenied.com\/news\/2012\/07\/06\/mind-control-gang-stalking-implants-testimony-of-james-walbert-dr-barrie-trower\/\">government or illuminati<\/a>, and the like<br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/www.examiner.com\/article\/secretly-forced-brain-implants-pt-1-explosive-court-case\">http:\/\/www.examiner.com\/article\/secretly-forced-brain-implants-pt-1-explosive-court-case<\/a><br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/pesn.com\/2010\/12\/07\/9501740_Bob_Boyce_verichip_removed\/\">http:\/\/pesn.com\/2010\/12\/07\/9501740_Bob_Boyce_verichip_removed\/<\/a><\/p>\n<blockquote class=\"tr_bq\" style=\"text-align:justify;\"><p>For decades, there has been a conspiratorial saga revolving around UFO abductions, and implanted devices. &nbsp;This phenomenon was depicted quite accurately in the <a href=\"http:\/\/x-files.wikia.com\/wiki\/Dana_Scully's_abduction\">X-Files<\/a> in the early 90&#8217;s and while the entire subculture appears to have been removed from the mainstream, it was written and complained about for a significant period of time. &nbsp;Over the last 7 years, similar stories have begun surfacing, this time in relation to OSEH, and mind control abuse. &nbsp;There has always been an opinion that the alien abductions were in fact government operations, disguised in order to shift blame, or worse, as a false flag operation.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<blockquote class=\"tr_bq\" style=\"text-align:justify;\"><p>The technology being used, because of the sheer breadth and lack of discovery of mass implants, leads me to believe that the cases above are themselves a deceptive operation in order to perpetrate a lie on the general public, and the mind control community. &nbsp;Namely: that microchip or nanotechnology implants are <i>required <\/i>to do these horrible things. &nbsp;This is supposed to give you a feeling of relief&#8230;

the group of TI&#8217;s seeks a mechanism that they believe they can <i>stop,<\/i>&nbsp;and in doing so wind up repeating stories and using articles that were shown to them for the specific purpose of confusing them as to how this is happening. &nbsp;They then begin regurgitating this information as fact, and because this is done in concert with their stories of <i>why<\/i>&nbsp;these things are happening, both are discarded by many. &nbsp;This is a <i>huge problem<\/i>&nbsp;for everyone, as they can and do give very valid testimony as to their personal experiences.<\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">Many of the &#8216;individual plays&#8217;
