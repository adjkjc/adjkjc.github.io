<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">I fell asleep on the way home, dozing off in the passenger seat. &nbsp;We had been driving for almost twelve hours. &nbsp;Somewhere between Ocala and Orlando, on 441, Mary was pulled over for speeding. &nbsp;The officer woke me up ten or twenty minutes later, and asked me one single question, &#8220;how do you know the girl driving the car?&#8221;</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">I was drowsy and a bit dazed from being woken. I told him that she was my ex-wife. &nbsp;He looked at me a bit perplexed, and asked me what her birthday was. &nbsp;I told him, and he muttered, &#8220;I hate a liar.&#8221; and walked back towards her. &nbsp; She was arrested for DUI, despite the fact that she had nothing at all to drink. &nbsp;She would later pass field sobriety, and a breathalizer test, yet she was still charged with the crime. &nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Apparently believing that we were really &#8220;on the run,&#8221; because of the mafia threats of set up, Mary had told the officer that I was a stranger she met in a restaurant down the street. &nbsp;I honestly didn&#8217;t even think about the possibility that she would have lied about how she knew me, but the officer used it as an excuse to take her to jail for&#8230; no reason at all.</div>
<blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align:justify;"><p>Over the course of the week prior, I had learned that Mary&#8217;s uncle&#8217;s brother in law was the chief of police in Ocala, which I wouldn&#8217;t correlate to this event until much, much later. &nbsp;Whatever the reason, it seems as if they planned the entire thing, first by lying to both her and I, then by causing the false arrest. &nbsp;Over the next six months, the &#8220;<b>silver handcuff</b>&nbsp;program&#8221; which I would be told about later by Mary manifested itself in full force. &nbsp;The district attorney&#8217;s office would threaten Mary repeatedly, and then after some very strange events, involving a sickness which I believe to be mind control related in the DA&#8217;s office, she would be coerced into taking a deal, despite being innocent.</p></blockquote>
<div style="text-align:justify;">The officer allowed me to drive the rental car back to her grandparents, and they offered me a bed for the night. &nbsp;The next morning, her grandmother offered me pancakes, and told me that I should stay there for a few days&#8230; they had wanted to &#8220;leave Mary there to learn a lesson.&#8221; &nbsp;I&#8217;m not sure what the lesson was, but looking back it seemed for a long time as if it was retribution for helping me avoid the issues that they were attempting to force on us. &nbsp;I told her I would never do that to Mary, and that I needed to call a cab to get to the jail to bail her out. &nbsp;After saying this, her grandfather offered to take me, and we went together for a three or four hour trip waiting for her to be processed. &nbsp;Immediately after being released, we set off for Florida, shaken significantly by the horrendously strange events which had befallen us on our Thanksgiving trip in 2010.</div>
