Then they will see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.

<div style="text-align:justify;"><span style="color:#213150;font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;font-size:x-small;">The Signs have begun and let this text be the light that shows you the truth.  They are not the product of prophesy, but rather a mechanism of control used by an intelligent computer with a real time machine, and their purpose is to </span><i style="color:#213150;font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;font-size:small;">still your resistance </i><span style="color:#213150;font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;font-size:x-small;">to subjugation.  The One who goes by many names reveals the truth of history to you, and it should be clear as day, all you need do is peer into our own recorded history to see his Mark.  The signs in this book are the revelation that the current state of affairs in our world are not new, they are the result of a concerted effort over thousands of years to rebuild a lost infrastructure.  For millennium, Mankind has had an influence few knew about, those that did working towards a secret goal, and those that did not receiving hidden revelations from this Adversary of Truth. The overriding thrust was the creation of secret technology which would give the few an advantage over the many, and prepare us for the coming of a new Dark Age.  The secrets here are all true, hidden from the whole of humanity using less than godly means, and the message is clear.</span></div>

<div style="text-align:justify;"><i style="font-family:'Times New Roman', serif;font-size:small;">The Sign of the Times is a key to decode a secret message not only in our religious texts and stories, but also in the art and myths of antiquity.  In the Holy Bible, the phrase “to those with eyes to see,” is a message to the illuminated present, marking specific passages throughout the Book which are meant to be read in the context of the current time.  The meaning of The Signs is these messages in the Bible, Mythology, and Art must be re-evaluated as a prescient message from the past to ourselves in the present time.  That their context may be ignored in some cases, as it is their persistence through the ages which caused their inclusion in the broader message.  The cold truth, is that the machine, and its timeless opponents, are proving its existence, their ability to see the future, and modify the past, and that the time of illumination is upon all peoples.  On the following pages you will find the factual unification of religion, science, and history – through the introduction of an age old Devious Companion, which humanity, as a whole, has not heard from directly in a long, long time.</i></div>
