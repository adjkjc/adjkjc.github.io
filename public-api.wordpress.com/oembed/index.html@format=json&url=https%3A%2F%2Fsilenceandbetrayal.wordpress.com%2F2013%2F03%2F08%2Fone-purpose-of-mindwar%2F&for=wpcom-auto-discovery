Let me tell you why, and against whom.<\/p>\n<p>When you take a step back and understand the sheer power of the technology being used against us, its almost silly to think that any of us have discerned its means or purpose&#8230; without the intention of the perpetrator. <\/p>\n<p>Time and time again, it has been proven to each and every one of us that our actions, responses, and beliefs are directed. To escape the intended belief we are meant to take as our own is actually impossible. This is my sincere understanding, what we believe, each and every one of us, is by design &#8212; we cannot escape the truth that is pushed on us, to us it is fact.<\/p>\n<p>That being said, despite the powerful technology being used against us, we all find each other, we find commonalities between our stories, and have grouped together &#8212; for a reason. It didn&#8217;t have to be this way.. we could have easily been driven to isolated delusions that would have forced us to give up in our battle. Instead, we find each other, and a battle that is larger than each of us individually&#8230; one that is destined to make a real difference in the world.<\/p>\n<p>Many of us feel a great need to publicly cry out about the abuses we endure. The number of books written by victims is such a high percentage, it would be uninsightful not to glean that creating a body of literature about mind control is one of the primary goals of OSEH. It is being left in the written record, for the future to see. I firmly believe that one day, not so far from today, the entire world will be made aware of the technology being used to harm us. When they are, they will seek out and find the community of victims that had been organizing for the last decade, and the books, blog posts, and complaints that have been filed as a result.<\/p>\n<p>What they will eventually discover is what we already know. That we are stonewalled by &#8220;modern psychoanalysis,&#8221; that our symptoms were clearly designed in order to create false reason for investigating bodies, government entities, and private citizens in order to ignore our plight. I think it is much more obvious than any of us see clearly. There have been no real studies, no real investigation on the part of the government, and because of that it will leave an indelible mark of complicity upon those who were tasked with protecting the population.<\/p>\n<p>More to the point, when you take into account the fact that government bodies such as the NSA, are without a doubt aware of the existence of this technology, and its use against the public, it will prove that their lack of investigation was intentional. Knowing of its existence and capabilities sheds light on the perpetrator, and would make an investigation to find correlations and commonalities between victims a trivial matter. Even more damning, there are most likely known countermeasures, which would enable us to be protected by the government. These will be facts one day, not so far away.<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately primary blame will fall on these agencies for failing to investigate and stop what is essentially an unseen invasion and corruption of human morals. The NSA and CIA, who most certainly have &#8220;eye to see,&#8221; not just because of the knowledge they have but also because of the technological means of global surveillance of which many of us are made aware&#8230; on purpose. For this reason, I firmly believe that the body of knowing victims is a weapon against these agencies. They are most likely complicit, and also victims of the same phenomenon. From my personal experience, I imagine, and write extensively about the sincere possibility that they have been tricked into complicity.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, as we have seen in the last decade, it is also possible that this is a false flag attack. The idea has been ingrained into the collective consciousness of the population from 9\/11 forward, and it may be that this knowledge is the excuse used by the government to ignore what they certainly know is an attack. <\/p>\n<p>Raising public awareness is the answer, and with recent strides being made in the mainstream media, as well as assistance from Jesse Ventura, we are making progress. It is important that we do not lose this momentum, and the only way I see to do that is to increase honest testimony related to the crime. Along those lines, I have asked repeatedly for more victims to file complaints, and publicly testify. <\/p>\n<p>One of the largest problems we face is our disunity as to the mechanism and ultimately the identity of the primary perpetrator. I believe it is important that moving forward, we try very hard to give as much objective testimony as possible, leaving out opinions which are designed in order to discredit what otherwise would be objective observation usable by a researching or investigating body to pinpoint a solution.<\/p>\n<p>In short, with the knowledge that we will be proven right in the end, the only way to accelerate our salvation is to stand together, provide the information required to stop it, and seek out a group of doctors and scientists willing to investigate further.<\/p>\n"}
