this information has come from first hand discovery. &nbsp;I have been a knowing victim since about December of 2010, right around my thirtieth birthday. &nbsp;I can trace the influence of mind control back throughout my entire life, however, from isolated incidents at ages as young as five, to much more involved intervention in my life from twelve onward. &nbsp;What has happened to me since 2010 has been a kind of demystification process, I have probably believed every stupid theory put forth by our fellow victims on the internet at one point or another. &nbsp;In the end, the vast majority of them are really <a href=\"http:\/\/unduecoercion.blogspot.com\/2013\/01\/what-is-oseh-organized-stalking-and.html\">bad theories<\/a>.<\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">I find almost unfathomable the lack of interest in our plight. &nbsp;From the government, who surely knows it exists at certain levels and is either ignorant or complicit, to friends and family who are <b>controlled<\/b>&nbsp;not to believe the victim, to the actual perpetrators &#8212; who are likewise <b>controlled<\/b>&nbsp;to participate, the entire world has become a wall of disbelief to me. &nbsp;Even fellow victims fight over technological and operational details, ignoring the fact that we are all victims, not only of the same crime, but of the <b>same perpetrator.<\/b>&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">This is one of the most important things I can convey: &nbsp;there are no individual perpetrators purchasing mind control in a box and using it against you. &nbsp;Your neighbor does not have a website interface to see inside your home, through your eyes, or to make you &#8220;feel&#8221; or &#8220;think&#8221; things. &nbsp;There does exist however, a very large civilian army of victim perpetrators, people who for one reason or another act <b>inhumanely <\/b>by participating in the torture of victims. &nbsp;They may be people you know well, they could be perfect strangers, and they could be neighbors. &nbsp; It is possible they were &#8220;planted&#8221; in your life, much like an intelligence handler, many years before their participation. &nbsp; At the same time, one of the major weapons used against victims is to create the appearance of a much larger group of people &#8220;out to get them.&#8221; &nbsp;Loved ones are mind controlled to disbelieve, and then to act in a manner which the victim sees a threatening, while their motivation may not be nefarious. &nbsp;Mind control is used in order to falsify the voices of people, which this enemy can do flawlessly. &nbsp;If you overhear conversations of people, without participating, it is highly probable the conversation was not real. &nbsp;At the same time, noises coming from neighbors homes, are most likely not real. &nbsp;It is very possible to create what is essentially an <b>auditory hallucination using mind control technology<\/b>. &nbsp;<\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">Along those lines, victims who receive V2K, or voice to skull, are not being attacked with silent sound, or an LRAD, and nobody has a tooth implant with a powerless radio transmitter in it (as I once believed with all my heart). &nbsp;The perpetrators are not communicating with cell phones, text messages, or using radio communications at all. &nbsp;These ideas are implanted in the mind of victims, and then rigorously <b>displayed to them<\/b>&nbsp;as a way of reinforcing this false belief. &nbsp;The purpose of this idea, in my case, was to nurture my personal belief that <b>only the victims of mindwar<\/b> are being mind controlled. &nbsp;In reality, all of the perpetrators are also being heavily mind controlled, and any and all communication regarding the OSEH\/mindwar operation is being conveyed to them with the very same technology that tortures victims&#8230; V2K. &nbsp;This is a direct manipulation of the auditory cortex, and using a mechanism which is not radio frequency related, it is nearly untraceable.<\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">Over the course of &#8220;learning&#8221; about mind control technology, I have tried and failed at using every conceivable countermeasure. &nbsp;<b>Faraday cages do not work<\/b>, this is prima facie evidence that the technology being used is <b>not electromagnetic in nature<\/b>. &nbsp;Period. &nbsp;It is not microwaves, it is not the Soviet woodpecker technology, and it is <b>not<\/b>&nbsp;coming from GWEN towers, cellular phones, wifi hotspots, or the microwave ray gun that you think your neighbor has pointed at your house.&nbsp;<\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">For a long, long time I believed that the easiest mechanism to control the minds of humans was nanotechnology. &nbsp;Several nano-stimulators per neuron, communicating either via some non electromagnetic means, or not requiring constant radio contact (they could store a &#8220;program&#8221;, upload it when communication is possible) made the most sense to me. &nbsp;I researched modern technology, like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/19964776\">IBCOM<\/a>, and for a long, long time I was <b>positive<\/b>&nbsp;that this was the predecessor of the technology being used. &nbsp;<b>It is not. &nbsp;<\/b>The technology afflicting not only the victims, but the perpetrators, and the world at large, is much more advanced than you would think. &nbsp;It has been affecting humanity for much longer than anyone would rationally decide.<\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\"><b><br \/><\/b><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">One of the primary reasons for making us, as victims, believe that we are a small persecuted group, is to hide from us the fact that mind control is being used on <b>everyone around us, all the time.<\/b>&nbsp; I never knew the people that were causing me such distress were also being mind controlled, because I believed they were communicating with high tech covert microwave transmitters. &nbsp;They could have just as easily been using text messages. <b>&nbsp;<\/b>&nbsp;I am very close to an entire family, connected to <b>organized crime<\/b>, and the United States <b>military<\/b>, who were primary participants in the initial phase of my introduction to OSEH\/mindwar. &nbsp; This is what I see, because it is what I have been shown. &nbsp;Others see jews, masons, religious groups, the <b>United States government <\/b>and the real truth is these groups are all&nbsp;involved&nbsp; but not as a whole. &nbsp; Had I known the entire time that those close to me were also victims, I probably would have acted differently. &nbsp;That is the purpose of these lies, to ensure that we do not realize that those around us are being affected by the very same technology which is tormenting us.<\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">The real group involved in attacking us is much more federated (kindof how we see Al-Quaeda today, in cells), but at the same time it also shows to the victims a front of solidarity. &nbsp;Groups which would otherwise be at each others throats, like warring narcotics empires, come together in order commit this crime. &nbsp;This tells you one thing, very clearly: at the highest level, these people are working for another entity. &nbsp;It could be the CIA, or it could be space aliens, it doesn&#8217;t really matter. &nbsp;What matters is that they work for this <b>thing<\/b>&nbsp;to their own detriment in order to further <b>it&#8217;s goals.<\/b>&nbsp; Period.<\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\"><b>The mind control works better than you think.<\/b>&nbsp; For a long, long time, I thought I was a test subject. &nbsp;I&#8217;m not, and neither are you. &nbsp;This thing is not being tested, it&#8217;s perfected. &nbsp;I was made to believe I was dealing with technology which needed to record and playback neural firing patterns, this was a complete falsehood, in the end. &nbsp;It was designed however, to make me believe that mind control was in its infantile stage, and further the <b>delusion <\/b>that I was an unwitting test subject. &nbsp;In the end, after all the falsely reinforced idea s about playing back previously recorded &#8220;feelings,&#8221; it has become clear that this technology has not only decoded human emotions, but has completely reverse engineered the entirety of neural circuitry. &nbsp; It&#8217;s been proven to me that this is a deception. &nbsp;<b>We are not test subjects, we are a weapon.<\/b><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\"><b><br \/><\/b><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">There have been other ideas that I&#8217;ve believed and dismissed. &nbsp;The ultimate perpetrator is <b>not religious, nor morally correct. &nbsp;<\/b>The attack on us is not meant to improve us in any way, nor to teach us a lesson. &nbsp;More to the point, the attack is designed <b>specifically to engender self-blame, where none is deserved.<\/b>&nbsp; You have not brought this upon you, and there is probably <b>nothing you can change internally to make it go away.<\/b><br \/><b><br \/><\/b><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">Back to the mind control working better than you think: &nbsp;there are points in our experience which we believe to be pivotal. &nbsp;Crossroads and turning points that internally we understand to have been a monumental decision that has changed the course of our lives. &nbsp;These points, along with our internal <b>feelings, <\/b>subvocal thought, and the ultimate decision itself <b>might be the result of nothing more than mind control.<\/b>&nbsp; It is absolutely possible that we have no free will, though its rational to believe we have some. &nbsp;Defeating the mind control technology is <b>impossible<\/b>&nbsp;without technological countermeasures. &nbsp;Christ will not save you, meditation will not save you, and <b>knowing about it, will not save you.<\/b>&nbsp;<\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">What will save us all is loving each other, organizing, and motivating ourselves to sacrifice for the greater good of humanity. &nbsp;We can today, join together, and make a difference. &nbsp;We need to show understanding to each other, and work together regardless of petty disputes. &nbsp;We need to stand up not only for ourselves, and our individual problems; but also for each others problems. &nbsp;<\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\"><b>I think.<\/b><\/div>\n"}
