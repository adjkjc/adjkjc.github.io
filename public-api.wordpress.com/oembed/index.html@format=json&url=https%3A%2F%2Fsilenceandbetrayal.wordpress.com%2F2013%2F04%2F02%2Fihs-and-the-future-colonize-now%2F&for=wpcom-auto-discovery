Repeatedly we have been told of a depopulation scheme, one which will ensure that this group has the resources they require to sustain themselves for perpetuity. &nbsp;The humor in all this, is that this very group is the one responsible for the slow but assured destruction not only of the world&#8217;s scarce resources, but in the drive to suppress any alternative fuel source which would allow for not only&nbsp;sustenance&nbsp;on Earth, but&nbsp;outside our planet in the Universe. &nbsp;At the same time that alternative energy sources and medicinal advances are suppressed in order to control the population, internationally space exploration programs are shut down; with the supposed intent of&nbsp;transferring&nbsp;these also to corporate interests. &nbsp;It is these very corporate interests, the likes of ExonMobil and their allies which have worked feverishly to&nbsp;suppress&nbsp;the technology required for interplanetary travel.<\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear:both;text-align:center;\"><a href=\"http:\/\/silenceandbetrayal.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/04\/ii-interior-perspective-12.jpg\" style=\"clear:left;float:left;margin-bottom:1em;margin-right:1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"198\" src=\"https:\/\/silenceandbetrayal.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/04\/ii-interior-perspective-1.jpg?w=320&#038;h=198\" width=\"320\" \/><\/a><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">It has been obvious for at least a century, the <i>only way that our species is to survive<\/i> is to shift gears, and focus on <b>intergalactic colonization<\/b>. &nbsp;The simple fact that the governments of the world have chosen to fight amongst each other, spending untold resources on a nuclear arms race which served no purpose but to stone wall the coming unification of humanity is the fingerprint of <b>IHS<\/b> on the 21st century.<\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\"><\/div>\n<div style=\"text-align:justify;\">The only way to defeat this enemy, is to unite and focus on self-sustenance&nbsp;throughout the galaxy. &nbsp;We are being destroyed, though without the proper vantage point it certainly would look like we are doing it to ourselves. &nbsp;Take a step back, and wonder who would attempt to stop us from growing, flourishing, and ensuring our survival. &nbsp; Humanity itself? &nbsp;I don&#8217;t think so.<\/p>\n<p>It appears to me that the goal of <b>IHS<\/b>, at least in the 20th and 21st century, has been to divide us to the point where it could overtake our global governments, and force a stand down to a battle which I believe was being waged by the USA and USSR together towards the end of the Cold War. &nbsp;I believe this alien force not only made itself known, but its true intentions, to keep us locked to this planet became apparent. &nbsp;At this point, both sides of the Cold War began detonating high atmosphere nuclear weapons under the guise of testing. &nbsp;It is my belief that they were not testing, but were rather trying to destroy a machine which they had deduced was invading the minds of government employees. &nbsp;It seems they have acquiesced to this desire, and international space exploration efforts have all but stopped, all eyes shifting to a financial crisis which appears to be manufactured in order to eliminate the debt of these governments.<\/p>\n<p>This force is limited, and while its weapon is powerful and fearful, there are most likely countermeasures known to the CIA and related bodies. &nbsp;In addition, pure growth, on a galactic scale, would most likely weaken its ability to influence human events&#8230; in short, agreeing not to colonize space is equivalent to <b>surrendering our civilizations future and hegemony<\/b>.<\/div>\n","thumbnail_url":"http:\/\/silenceandbetrayal.files.wordpress.com\/2013\/04\/ihs.jpg?fit=440%2C330","thumbnail_width":null,"thumbnail_height":null}
