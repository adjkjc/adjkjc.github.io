<p>In researching this article, I was searching for documentation relating to the Carnivore Project, and the resulting legal battle with the ACLU. &nbsp;Once upon a time, our society responded to such unconstitutional and treasonous privacy intrusions with a legal battle, or a temporary restraining order. &nbsp;The media covered these events once.</p>
<p>Check out the following:<br />&nbsp;<a href="http://www.accelerated-promotions.com/consumer-electronics/usa-patriot-act-carnivore.htm">http://www.accelerated-promotions.com/consumer-electronics/usa-patriot-act-carnivore.htm</a></p>
<p>And then be very, very sad that NBC has removed the <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/660096.asp?cp1=1">page that is linked to at the bottom</a> of the above. </p>
<p><b>Welcome to the Hidden American Empire. &nbsp;</b>Censorship of this type, in private sector media, at the obvious behest and benefit of the United States Government is <i style="font-weight:bold;">disgusting</i>, and you <b>should</b>&nbsp;care.</p>
<p>Do you? &nbsp;What&#8217;s really going on here:</p>
<p><a name='more'></a><br />The sad truth is that both Carnivore and Magic Lantern are part of a public disinformation campaign, one that is hiding a much more disturbing truth. &nbsp;That the United States, as well as international intelligence, has had the capability of modifying circuitry, including computer processors and neural circuitry, remotely for at least the last 50 years, using advanced physics, which they are also hiding from the general public.</p>
<p>From aclu.org (who by the way is <b>censoring</b>&nbsp;the fact that Carnivore was in operation prior to 9/11/2001:</p>
<blockquote><p>August 15, 2007&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Since 2002, telephone companies have been colluding in the president&#8217;s domestic spying program, wiretapping communications networks and voluntarily providing the NSA with millions of customers&#8217; calling records. This information has been turned over without customer knowledge or consent, and without any court order, warrant, or other proper legal process.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>In 2006,&nbsp;<a class="noline_blue" href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2006-05-10-nsa_x.htm" style="background-color:transparent;background-position:initial initial;background-repeat:initial initial;border:0;color:#225588;font-size:14px;margin:0;outline:0;padding:0;text-decoration:initial;vertical-align:baseline;" target="_blank"><i style="background-color:transparent;border:0;font-size:14px;margin:0;outline:0;padding:0;vertical-align:baseline;">USA Today</i>&nbsp;revealed</a>&nbsp;the telecoms’ participation in the illegal spying program. A number of lawsuits were filed against various telecom companies including the ACLU of Illinois lawsuit&nbsp;<i style="background-color:transparent;border:0;font-size:14px;margin:0;outline:0;padding:0;vertical-align:baseline;">Terkel v. AT&amp;T</i>, on behalf of the late author Studs Terkel and other Illinois citizens, and two lawsuits filed by the three California ACLU affiliates,&nbsp;<i style="background-color:transparent;border:0;font-size:14px;margin:0;outline:0;padding:0;vertical-align:baseline;">Campbell v. AT&amp;T</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i style="background-color:transparent;border:0;font-size:14px;margin:0;outline:0;padding:0;vertical-align:baseline;">Riordan v. Verizon</i>. These cases were all joined together with over 40 others and are now pending before U.S. District Court Judge Vaughn Walker in California.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The ACLU of Illinois has been named co-lead counsel in the consolidated cases.<br />But by the time the consolidated cases came to him, Walker had already ruled on one of those cases,&nbsp;<i style="background-color:transparent;border:0;font-size:14px;margin:0;outline:0;padding:0;vertical-align:baseline;">Hepting v. AT&amp;T</i>. Hepting is a class-action lawsuit brought by the&nbsp;<a class="noline_blue" href="http://www.eff.org/" style="background-color:transparent;background-position:initial initial;background-repeat:initial initial;border:0;color:#225588;font-size:14px;margin:0;outline:0;padding:0;text-decoration:initial;vertical-align:baseline;" target="_blank">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>&nbsp;that was filed soon after the&nbsp;<i style="background-color:transparent;border:0;font-size:14px;margin:0;outline:0;padding:0;vertical-align:baseline;">The New York Times</i>&nbsp;revealed the NSA’s warrantless surveillance program in December 2005. That lawsuit charges that the telecom giant violated customers&#8217; Fourth Amendment rights by giving the NSA unfettered access to its communications and customer data with a warrant. Walker ruled that government could not use the state secrets privilege to block the lawsuit.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The government appealed that decision, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit heard oral arguments in August 2007. But before the appeals court could deliver a decision on the appeal, Congress passed the FISA Amendments Act in July 2008, which essentially legalized the NSA&#8217;s wiretapping operation. Following the law&#8217;s signing, the appeals court declined to rule on&nbsp;<i style="background-color:transparent;border:0;font-size:14px;margin:0;outline:0;padding:0;vertical-align:baseline;">Hepting</i>&nbsp;and remanded the case back to district court.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>On December 2, 2008, the ACLU and EFF were back before Judge Walker arguing the unconstitutionality of the FISA Amendments Act. <b>A decision is pending.</b></p></blockquote>
<p>To summarize, in response to an illegal and unconstitutional operation being conducted by the National Security Agency and a multitude of private telecommunications providers, the United States Congress passed an unconstitutional law to &#8220;legalize&#8221; the program before a decision could be delivered by our &#8220;judicial system.&#8221; &nbsp;Just to fill you in, it is the job of the Judicial branch of our Federal government, and specifically the Supreme Court, to strike down unconstitutional laws.</p>
<p>In related news, the Supreme Court is still being <a href="http://aoc.gov/projects/supreme-court-west-fa%C3%A7ade-restoration">renovated</a>.</p>
