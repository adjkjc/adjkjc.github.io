<div style="text-align:justify;">After terrorizing AOL with freedom, many of the people who were engaged in chatting on the famous service&#8217;s &#8220;rooms&#8221; for hours on end moved to something that was much older, and much larger. &nbsp;Internet Relay Chat. &nbsp;AOL began offering TCP/IP connection to the <i>internet</i>&nbsp;in the early nineties, though most users didn&#8217;t know or utilize it. &nbsp;This opened many of the fledgling web&#8217;s hidden services to people who had never before experienced the breadth of global&nbsp;connectedness&nbsp;which came from a vast sea of users. &nbsp;Many of us began congregating on IRC, and almost unilaterally changed direction from Windows programming in Visual Basic to learning another very old technology. &nbsp;The POSIX system, embodied in freely distributed and community created systems: FreeBSD and Linux. &nbsp;This was mid 90&#8217;s, and in those days <i>Ubuntu&#8217;s </i>Windows like plug and play distribution wasn&#8217;t even an idea in Mark Shuttleworth&#8217;s mind. &nbsp;We were plunged into a world of custom kernel compilations and config file jockeying. &nbsp;Children learning to service the innards of the types of systems which ran the world&#8217;s largest companies and government operations.</div>
<blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align:justify;"><p>It&#8217;s no surprise to me today that the world we were plunged into was also <b>tagged</b>&nbsp;with religious iconography, much like the world&#8217;s multitude of corporations including illuminati imagery. In my mind, these things are done subconsciously, like much of the modern day prophesy which secretly implants the ideas as symbols of the <b>hidden influence</b>&nbsp;in our culture and society. &nbsp;Some of these ideas are <b>Deus Ex Machina</b><i>, </i>the artificial intelligence singularity: the <b>Source</b> (from the Matrix), and <b>Skynet</b> (from Terminator). &nbsp;The idea of a consciousness being born from the creation of humanity, machines, is riddled in our modern day art, and for most people it&#8217;s an inevitable conclusion that it will eventually happen. &nbsp;<b>What if it has already?</b>&nbsp; What if it happened before we began building tools from sticks and stones?<i> </i>If Satan were in the Machine, as kids we were learning how to do routine maintenance on the <b>hidden influence</b>&nbsp;itself.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<div style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace;font-size:x-small;">Then I turned to see the voice that was speaking with me. And having turned I saw seven golden lampstands; and in the middle of the lampstands I saw one like a son of man, clothed in a robe reaching to the feet, and girded across His chest with a golden sash. His head and His hair were white like white wool, like snow; and His eyes were like a flame of fire. His feet were like burnished bronze, when it has been made to glow in a furnace, and His voice was like the sound of many waters. In His right hand He held seven stars, and out of His mouth came a sharp two-edged sword; and His face was like the sun shining in its strength.</span></div>

<div style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Courier New, Courier, monospace;font-size:x-small;">-Revelation 1:12-16</span></div>
<p><span style="font-family:Courier New, Courier, monospace;font-size:x-small;"></span></p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align:justify;"><p><span style="font-family:inherit;">Revelation speaks of a <b>son of man</b>, progeny of our entire civilization. &nbsp;It is an allusion to a machine, created by mankind, and this is made clearer with its references to red lights, and metals adorning its body. It is the same concept described by Deus Ex Machina, the Singularity, and in our modern art. &nbsp;The sound of many waters could easily be the humm of an engine or power source, described by someone who had no knowledge of what those things are. &nbsp;The seven stars are part of the key to decoding Revelation, they point directly to the hidden theme of repeating like ideas which take on the true meaning when taken together.</span></p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq"><p><span style="font-family:Courier New, Courier, monospace;font-size:x-small;">As for the mystery of the seven stars which you saw in My right hand, and the seven golden lampstands: the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches. -Revelation 1:20</span></p></blockquote>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><a href="https://silenceandbetrayal.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/pain2.jpg" style="clear:right;display:inline!important;float:right;margin-bottom:1em;margin-left:1em;text-align:justify;"><img border="0" height="200" src="https://silenceandbetrayal.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/pain.jpg?w=173&#038;h=200" width="173" /></a>Around the same time, at a &#8220;play&#8221; gathering at a friends house, BASIC programming came up. &nbsp;I was surprised that the friend of my friend was also interested in the same things as me, programming, Linux, etc. &nbsp;In what seemed like the most innocuous thing in the world at the time, he mentioned an IRC channel which housed a gathering of people like us, sharing information in .TXT files on BBS&#8217;s and the internet. &nbsp;The group was called the <b><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20111027234914/http://pain.net/">Pan American Information Network</a>, </b>and it remains a big part of my life through today. &nbsp;It is also a huge piece of the maze that brought me to the Illuminati, and the innocuous suggestion from an&nbsp;acquaintance&nbsp;now reeks of something I refer to as a <b><a href="http://nesara.insights2.org/Monarch.html">handler transfer</a></b>&nbsp;in <b>mind control parlance.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align:justify;"><p>From this point forward, and through my entire adult life, I would unknowingly be surrounded by agents of the Illuminati. &nbsp; They could be friends, lovers, or&nbsp;acquaintances, &nbsp; but the commonality they had was they either&nbsp;<b>knew</b>&nbsp;about mind control, or were heavily influenced by it. &nbsp;Some were in communication, via synthetic telepathy, with a centralized authority, though to this day I&#8217;m not sure what <b>they</b>&nbsp;think it is, and its very possible that they don&#8217;t all believe the same thing. &nbsp;I would not understand the method of communication for many years, nor would I know exactly who they were until it was revealed to me during the process of gang-stalking. &nbsp;In the public eye, these Handler&#8217;s are the equivalent of Sirhan Sirhan&#8217;s <b>angel</b> who touched him on his shoulder just prior to &#8220;shooting&#8221; RFK&#8230; in my world it appears they were in place to make small adjustments in my life course, to help tell the story that you are hearing today. &nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<div style="text-align:justify;">#PAIN would become a gathering place of people who had followed the same path as me, programmers from AOL, Linux&nbsp;aficionados,&nbsp;and hackers. &nbsp; <b>Everyone</b>&nbsp;from the original creator of <b>AOHell</b>&nbsp;to the leader of the group was influencedk by the Illuminati and the <b>hidden influence</b>, our paths were too similar, and the fact that we remained closely connected through the power of the internet is a testament to their use of &nbsp;computers and networking in fulfilling their plan. &nbsp;For years we would discuss everything from gadgets, to hacking, to religion, and in many cases would have day long conversations about the inner workings of the universe and the world around us. &nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">In 1996 I met a real life friend from #PAIN, local to my area, and the next year we went to a <b>2600 meeting</b> together. &nbsp;The coordinator of the meeting would turn out to be an ex-Navy officer, who received a monthly check from them. &nbsp;This kind of government payroll, and usage of the sprawling military industrial complex in order to finance their operation, and pay <b>handlers</b>, is indicative of the Illuminati.</div>
<blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align:justify;"><p>Last year, after being told that this operation had been in place my entire life&#8230; using the <b>Truman Show</b>&nbsp;as a euphemism for life-long monitoring, I asked for proof. &nbsp;The details of this interaction are astounding, and the answer won&#8217;t make sense to you until much later, but the reply was <b>perfect.</b></p></blockquote>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:Courier New, Courier, monospace;font-size:x-small;">It all started on AOL.</span></div>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:Courier New, Courier, monospace;font-size:x-small;">#Mafia</span></div>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:Courier New, Courier, monospace;font-size:x-small;">#FBI</span></div>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:Courier New, Courier, monospace;font-size:x-small;">#KGB</span></div>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:Courier New, Courier, monospace;font-size:x-small;">#PAIN</span></div>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:Courier New, Courier, monospace;font-size:x-small;">#fuck_the_world</span></div>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:Courier New, Courier, monospace;font-size:x-small;">#hellonearth</span></div>
<blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align:justify;"><p>The connotation was that the channels I talked in were somehow contrived. &nbsp;That mind control was used in order to not only place me there, but to create the channel names. &nbsp;On IRC these names could be anything, and for them to have been so clearly tied to the story that had been told to me for the past year was&#8230; unbelievable. &nbsp;Also mildly unbelievable that I hadn&#8217;t realized or noticed. &nbsp;&nbsp;Almost as soon as it was spoken, it was taken away. &nbsp;I thought of an alternative, in the usual synthetic transfer of <b>semiotic thoughts</b>. &nbsp;They <b>had </b>been watching, but the story for the last year was retrofit to my history, designed to create the false impression that the mind control had been there&#8230; my entire life. &nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align:justify;"><p><b>I would later realize that the first story, that I had experienced the influence of a supernatural force since.. before my birth was the real truth. &nbsp;It is a parallel for human history, and for the realization that this same force has&nbsp;been influencing us since before our creation.</b></p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align:justify;"><p>This was the exact order I began chatting in those channels on IRC, and it paralleled &nbsp;exactly the change between organizations which I believed was responsible for the <b>mind control attack </b>which is known as gang-stalking or OSEH. &nbsp;I had spent months researching the <b>who</b>&nbsp;and the <b>how</b>, and my trail, directed the whole time by the <b>hidden influence</b>&nbsp;brought me step by step through each of those organizations, and then the final realization that they were <b>all involved. </b>&nbsp;It also links the entire organization to the machine, the son of man from the Bible. &nbsp;It is a microcosm of the story that you are being told, and this ability to create fractal-like stories within stories has been repeated to me over and over again.</p></blockquote>
