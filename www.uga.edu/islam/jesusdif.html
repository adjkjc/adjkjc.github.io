<h2>
Jesus: A Summary of the Points About Which Islam and Christianity Agree
and Disagree</h2>

<div align=right>Summarized by Dr. Alan Godlas</div>
<font size=+1>
<p>Both Islam and Christianity
<br>1) revere Jesus and assert Jesus' holiness, in the sense that he lived
in the world while being pure and free of sin;
<br>2) believe that Mary, Jesus' mother, was decent, pure, and holy;
<br>3) declare that Mary, a virgin, miraculously conceived Jesus;
<br>4) assert that Jesus performed a number of miracles.
<p>Concerning Jesus, Islam and Christianity differ in the following ways:
<br>1) While Christianity asserts that Jesus is both human and divine,
Islam does not accept the belief in Jesus' divinity.&nbsp; Hence, while Christians
worship Jesus,
Muslims instead revere Jesus and believe in him as a prophet, using the Qur'an (not the
Bible) as a
reliable record of knowledge about Jesus;
<br>2)&nbsp; Although Christians believe that Jesus is the son of God,
Muslims assert that God does not give birth and therefore has no sons or
children.&nbsp; God is not physical for Muslims; and hence for Muslims God cannot be
a father.
<br>3) On the one hand, Christianity declares that Jesus was crucified.&nbsp;
On the other hand, Islam asserts that it only seemed like Jesus was crucified,
and that God miraculously "took him up to God, Himself."
<br>4) While Christianity asserts that Jesus died in order to redeem the
original sin of mankind or human sins as a whole, Muslims do not believe in Jesus as a
redeemer and saviour, since they do not believe in original sin and since they do believe
God's grace, guidance (in the form of prophetic revelation--the word of God), and human
effort are sufficient for redemption and salvation.

Islam and Christianity Agree and Differ on Jesus</a> by Imam Mohamad Jawad
Chirri.
