Some random fool &hellip; some little girl in Dallas or Houston or &hellip; it might even have been &ldquo;San Diego&rdquo; &hellip; she had the nerve to aske me if I was angry that &ldquo;they had stolen my sword&rdquo; and I&rsquo;m fairly certain whether or not you see it or believe me today, you are sitting on it&ndash;and I can&rsquo;t bear to see the ooze coming from the cavity &hellip; I think it&rsquo;s called a &ldquo;pericetum.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I am to this day uncertain as to what kind of monster could have forced a woman named &ldquo;car he why see silicon Monday&rdquo; would stand before the world and literally deny that truth&ndash;but whatever, it&rsquo;s just another drop in the bucket of tears that has become a river not of sadness or blood, but of &ldquo;fingernails&rdquo; and &ldquo;CAT machines&rdquo; that are nothing more than &hellip;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">That&rsquo;s a &ldquo;pipe dream&rdquo; though, it really is&ndash;I can see that clearly; it&rsquo;s a pipe dream that after this spectacle anyone would ever again mistake &ldquo;my&rdquo; for &ldquo;our&rdquo; or &ldquo;your is&rdquo; for &ldquo;[ma] we aren&rsquo;t.&rdquo; I wonder if she traveled there, to Maui; or if it even matters that there are a hundred other native words just as interesting and informative as &ldquo;verwickt&rdquo; and &ldquo;verbotten&rdquo; before we even begin to talk about veracity and Veritas and &hellip; verily, verily, verily&ndash;Merrill Lynch and &hellip;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">[i dont need to remind myself to write something about Lehman Brothers and &ldquo;When Genius Failed&rdquo;] but just in case I&rsquo;m not here to speak the words &hellip; I sat down next to an embassy on some road in some small part of Washington D.C.; the embassy &hellip; it was probably Israel&rsquo;s had some gigantic banner outside that said something like &ldquo;50th Jubilee&rdquo; (I&rsquo;m pretty sure, but I could be guesstimating) &hellip; and on a bench were etched these words:</p>
<p><code>I love you brother, whoever you are.</code></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&rsquo;ve recently noted that I don&rsquo;t think the words &hellip; or the song &hellip; screaming &ldquo;watch him as he goes&rdquo; or the one that says something about &ldquo;your life is an open book&rdquo; &hellip; I don&rsquo;t think those words were written or coined or sang with the help or the hand of God&ndash;but rather in a time long after that thing, the idea of that thing had perished for a very long time in a tomb that has nothing at all to do with &ldquo;Boulders&rdquo; or &ldquo;Hadashah&rdquo; &hellip; but rather perhaps some time before there was a Menoitius and a &hellip; a land that was sure they were &ldquo;unclean and clapping their hands, patting themselves on the back&hellip;&rdquo; and surely not on the ve<a href="../www.britannica.com/topic/Copt.html">rge of total annihilation&ndash;</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&ndash;even though it&rsquo;s clear to me, looking at you; the &ldquo;<a href="../bit.ly/2yv4kNE.html">destruction</a>&rdquo; has already happened, and it&rsquo;s already taken it&rsquo;s toll.</p>

Understand, I saw it with my own eyes&ndash;and it was not a delusion or a hallucination&ndash;but to all who see these words, the alucinare here is that &ldquo;we will just move on.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We will not move on without discussing abortion, and we will not move on without discussing censorship &hellip; and we will not move on without eradicating the desire to force and cause attrition, and we will not move on without eradicating rape.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I will adbicate nothing, and remind you the word, &ldquo;abdicate&rdquo; &hellip; it has nothing to do with &ldquo;chewing&rdquo; NOR THE FORCE OF KEY STROKES. See it now as a chapter, in a book about the word GAMYAHIM; part of a prayer and a song &hellip; and a poem etched in the hearts of those familiar with the actual deluge that I write about. This fabled thing, &ldquo;as it was in the days when we were sure Noah and Giglamesh were one with &hellip; some historical character&hellip;&rdquo; as it was in the days when the Tigris and the Euphrates were rivers that bordered the land hidden and fabled to be the location of the famous Eden of Genesis. In those days; when we knew that our history and our beliefs were important, just as the history and beliefs that they were based on &hellip; in those days we didn&rsquo;t knnow the Fringe and the Fray had anything or something to do with &ldquo;Tzitzit&rdquo; or the little knots on the little strings on the prayer shawl &hellip; nor did we know if these markers were anything like the imagery depicted by Dan Reynolds in the music video for &ldquo;Radioactive&rdquo; nor did we know for sure that these are the messages of angels, and they too link to Pacey and to K-Pax and to the thing I called &ldquo;scrying&rdquo; but &hellip; really was just another kind of act and counting mechanism depicted by Orson Scott Card &hellip; in either his eponymous book about the new religion started by Ender Wiggin upon his return from &ldquo;hyperlight travel&rdquo; or the one after that, named for his actions as a child, on a moon base &hellip; a moon of some planet not Earth; a base built by not Earthlings, but by some other species &hellip; the same species that was eradicated by their inability to speak and respond appropriately&ndash;that last book, called Xenocide.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Card envisioned &ldquo;nets&rdquo; &hellip; I had originally thought it to be prophetic&ndash;and then I imagine somewhat apocalyptic&ndash;as in he must have seen some future better than the one that we&rsquo;re currently in. I kind of still agree with that prospect and that position; but no longer fear or feel that the thing that I&rsquo;m looking for is &hellip; &ldquo;a bygone era&rdquo; or an entity no longer accessible. Rather I see here we have &ldquo;less to no interest&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s probably because the tools and the things I dream about have come to fruition; and we&rsquo;ve seen them, use them, and care more for those things than the process by which they are formed. It&rsquo;s a strange place&ndash;this seed of the dawn of time&ndash;and I fear nobody really believes that &ldquo;we lose them&rdquo; if we don&rsquo;t build them again.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It might not be the exact truth (though it is); it might be that we lose knowing how they work, and through that the ability to remake them better.

Of course all these things, whether you see a waypoint in Halo and in &ldquo;Xbox Online&rdquo; or one in some other thing &hellip; like &ldquo;Mastodon&rdquo; &hellip; these waypoints bring us to another level of &hellip; &ldquo;connectiveness&rdquo; within the thing that I&rsquo;m sure is literally the elephant in the room, something connecting Occulus Rift and &hellip; &ldquo;sight of virtual reality &hellip; controls.&rdquo;</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekPBOVgGRSA">It&rsquo;s this waypoint in the &ldquo;Ontological Web&rdquo; and the semantics of connecting semaphores and synapses; creation and Norseen&rsquo;s &ldquo;semiotics&rdquo; &hellip; the echelon like leap ahead of the simple symbolic structure understanding that I once &hellip; gleaned from the work of Duncan Laurie, interpreting the thing that pours and exudes real conscious &ldquo;<strong>sparks</strong>&rdquo; linking the words &ldquo;occipetal&rdquo; and &hellip;</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekPBOVgGRSA">&hellip; I must be dreaming of some new word, not an accident or of the Occidental connection between Obama&rsquo;s &ldquo;brain mapping initiative&rdquo; and the concrete cordyceps that link the petals of a flower and the poems of &hellip; comparison and conditioning &hellip; whether tis nobler to have loved and lost a flower leaf, than never to have noted that violet is not blue at all&hellip; nor to mention that in my haste and my screeching that we need to ensure that we don&rsquo;t lose things like &ldquo;Star Wars&rdquo; and Maclunkey and also the dolphins and the whales of SeaQuest and Star Trek &hellip; but to mention that in our haste and lack of care for the &ldquo;word cursive&rdquo; &hellip; or the loss of &quot;ink wells and the feathers that tied Yankee Doodle and &hellip; burning the candle at both ends.</a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekPBOVgGRSA">It&rsquo;s the same kind of thought stream that ties &ldquo;let there be light&rdquo; to Bram Stokers &hellip; or is it Bach&rsquo;s symphonic organ playing that must have &hellip; in the womb &hellip; sounded like something of a warning that soon the eyes would form and the melodic calmness that had been the &ldquo;all of everything we had known prior to that moment in gestation&rdquo; that it was all about to change, and there would be &ldquo;light&rdquo; and there would be &ldquo;darkness&rdquo; and the difference would be something we had to ponder to no end until that moment that it would happen again, and we would the thrust from the comfort of an ooze filled sack into this world that has gravity and switches and doors and &hellip; and you see those hands and the things we couldn&rsquo;t yet count, they too would yield eventually to things like typing and &ldquo;flipping the switches.&rdquo; To think that all thought derives from something as binary as &ldquo;light and dark&rdquo; or &ldquo;on and off&rdquo; is almost hard to fathom, but it&rsquo;s there, in the recesses of everything comparing whether or not violence too cues i</a>nto &ldquo;your tuning fork&rdquo; when I say &ldquo;Roses are red&rdquo; and do you remember the word &ldquo;bough&rdquo; and whether or not it breaks before Ivan said &ldquo;bow&rdquo; &hellip; or if it was at that exact moment.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It&rsquo;s a long list of new things we have to &ldquo;make sure we remember to forget and then find novel and useful again&rdquo; things like Jack and Jill and New Jack City and &hellip; and the city called Beacon and the city called El <a href="../fromthemachine.org/TY.html">Dorado and the city called &ldquo;Ur&rdquo; </a>still missing the point. Naturally <a href="../fromthemachine.org/SECORDANDOLIVED.html">it&rsquo;s also a place</a> where <a href="../fromthemachine.org/ALLTA.html">Ur and Uz had nothing to do with &ldquo;Morgana&rdquo;</a> or Gan Eden or &hellip; I <a href="../fromthemachine.org/PENCE.html">mean we knew Ur was in Mesopotamia</a>, and <a href="../ftm.liber-t.xyz/BETHESDAY.html">we know that&rsquo;s somewhere in or near present day Iran</a>, and we <strong><em>know the Promised Land is close</em></strong>; and we know it has something to do with Willy Wonka and we know it has something to do with rivers of &ldquo;Flowing Milk and Honey.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We know that spies were sent, a total of twelve in all to the future, and we know that two remained&ndash;one was named Joshua and one was named Kaleb.

<p style="text-align: justify;">Calligraphy; geometry and the &ldquo;geolock&rdquo; &hellip; the idea that God and Empire are tied together; to the Jews who chanted many times over &ldquo;King of the Universe&rdquo; never in jest and never with a &hellip; feeling that something was wrong &hellip; to see those two words also connect to &ldquo;ground&rdquo; and to &ldquo;Earth&rdquo; and that in truth Genesis and Exodus have very little meaning until we reach the time that Arthur round table is somehow &ldquo;gone from the top of Pisa&rdquo; and that song I wanted Taylor to put on the record, I am almost positive she wouldn&rsquo;t even dream of doing something so favorable to my Osirian dream. Our lock, still pertinent; ties of course to John Locke and to rivers and to Rheadamgate; and the most important thing of all is that I still don&rsquo;t see it&ndash;even though from the way you act and the way the world glares at my in secret silence, I can only imagine you find it comical that I still call myself Kish at heart.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here though that table and it&rsquo;s fable mean something to us all&ndash;it&rsquo;s a story about a King that gave everything he could &hellip; (at least, that&rsquo;s the hidden between the lines feeling I get) to his Knights; to the &ldquo;noble lords of the land of Avalon&rdquo; &hellip; and in turn &hellip; somehow he would up getting killed. It parallels Caesar, who of course did the exact opposite; or perhaps depending on who you were, maybe didn&rsquo;t&hellip; and Shakespeare ties that same story of some kind of &hellip; betrayal &hellip; to his famous words and those words somehow in my mind directly link to the kiss of Judas. Another table, another era; and one less &ldquo;mesa&rdquo; &hellip; but again here we are sta<a href="../fromthemachine.org/VESUBIACEIUM.html">ring at what is s</a>upposed to be an obvious and clear &ldquo;technical revolution&rdquo; of the <a href="../fromthemachine.org/OUITHEPPL.html">progress of democracy</a>&ndash;one that&rsquo;s clearly been stalled and halted by things like <a href="../fromthemachine.org/REASON.html">&ldquo;not amending the Constitution properly</a>&rdquo; (that&rsquo;s according to me, and that&rsquo;s before really se<a href="../fromthemachine.org/ATCONGRESS.html">eing you) &hellip; and then here e</a>ven in a place where we can acknowledge that those laws are archa<a href="../bit.ly/2uKEliL.html">ic and back</a>wards and not &ldquo;up to speed&rdquo; with the current needs of a technocratic civilization, we still fail to do anything about &ldquo;voting for ideas over people&rdquo; something he once said was a victory&ndash;or about the world&rsquo;s software degrading to something less than even remotely &ldquo;unclear&rdquo; &hellip; communication itself is clearly being lost, and it&rsquo;s clearly something to do with &ldquo;censorship&rdquo; and something to do with &ldquo;a secret&rdquo; and something to do with &hellip;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">To be standing here and having an actual well schooled and intelligent rabbi trying to rewrite the meaning of the word &ldquo;anarchy&rdquo; &hellip; in order to promote it; to say it&rsquo;s something other than &hellip; &ldquo;anarchy&rdquo; that&rsquo;s the crux of what I see&ndash;a world that just wants to skip ahead, to fast forward through all the work and the struggle of actually rebuilding or building something that works; to &ldquo;assuming&rdquo; the system that allowed for this place to be &hellip; so poorly managed, that it must be everything it says or shows or makes believe it truly isn&rsquo;t capable of &hellip; &ldquo;emancipation&rdquo; of something that doesn&rsquo;t like the word water, and doesn&rsquo;t like the idea of being masses, or massless; and on top of all that doesn&rsquo;t even want to put it&rsquo;s two cents in&ndash;other than to say, I&rsquo;m with Ivan or I&rsquo;m with Taylor or &ldquo;long live Bianca&rdquo; and through it all, words like &ldquo;now that you&rsquo;re gone, I can finally step up and move along&rdquo; &hellip;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Back to the sky; I suppose &hellip; is what it is that the &ldquo;river&rdquo; means to Taylor, and I just wonder in our song what&rsquo;s left here&ndash;if I was wrong to assume our system wouldn&rsquo;t have allowed the mass slavery of entire civilization and to believe that your &ldquo;brains&rdquo; must be simulated &hellip; as in &ldquo;not actually here&rdquo; but rather there&ndash;or just to assume you wouldn&rsquo;t be so damned hubratically sure that whatever you are &hellip; it&rsquo;s so far above and so far advanced of the &ldquo;things you pretend to be here&rdquo; that you can just disregard the mass enslavement of them or yourselves or whatever it truly is; to look around and show you in this place, it&rsquo;s clear we care more for animals than for each other, and it&rsquo;s surely obvious that in the grand scheme&mdash;were we not so wrong here&ndash;we might have been right about &ldquo;being so much more advanced.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s that leap to something so much smarter and so much &hellip; more capable; like growing fingers and exiting the womb, that&rsquo;s the kind of experience and the magical leap forward I envision the ascension and the singularity to be&ndash;except here we are,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Staring at &ldquo;his story&rdquo; this place somehow &hellip; &ldquo;found the ground&rdquo; for a world that was lost without scissors or a leg to stand on. That one too, light from a song, words you&rsquo;d probably attribute either to God or to Christ depending on who you believe the Spirit of Rock and Roll really is;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:10px;">In the early days of the rebellion, Judah received a surname Maccabee. Several explanations have been put forward for this surname. One suggestion is that the name derives from the <a href="../bit.ly/2gVa5jY.html" title="Aramaic language">Aramaic</a> <em>maqqaba</em> (&ldquo;makebet&rdquo; in modern <a href="../bit.ly/2iaVLU3.html" title="Hebrew language">Hebrew</a>), &ldquo;hammer&rdquo; or &ldquo;sledgehammer&rdquo; (cf. the cognomen of <a href="../en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Martel.html" title="Charles Martel">Charles Martel</a>, the 8th century Frankish leader), in recognition of his ferocity in battle. Others believe it is in reference to his weapon of choice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10px;">It is also possible that the name Maccabee is an <a href="../en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acronym.html" title="Acronym">acronym</a> for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torah" title="Torah">Torah</a> verse <em>Mi kamokha ba&rsquo;elim Adonai</em>, &ldquo;Who among the gods is like you, O Adonai?&rdquo;, his battle-cry to motivate troops.

<p># GEOCITIES</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We&#39;ve gone through &quot;echelons of change&quot; in our social interaction on the internet ... over the years I&#39;ve been here.&nbsp; I&#39;ve often &quot;categorized&quot; these epochs by the places that we&#39;d &quot;congregate&quot; ... in my life, AOL, IRC ... &quot;friendster&quot; and Facebook are good examples; though there&#39;s a &quot;city in the sky&quot; microcosm &quot;... or something&quot; in the series of companies that offered &quot;free web hosting.&quot;&nbsp; That&#39;s sort of what it takes to &quot;have a voice&quot; on the internet in these days; in a place where we once thought &quot;bloggers were the next big thing&quot; and Blogger.com ... and wordpress--those kinds of sites are all but dead, and medium.com is charging a &quot;viewerbase&quot; which is almost a sad joke.&nbsp; The news is all fake and the stories we see, the world we see--I don&#39;t have much faith that any of it is real beyond ... as far as my nose--to be honest.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The series started with Geocities; and that&#39;s gone, something like my &quot;topological map&quot; of friends and friends of friends probably would have oozed out of something like Blogger or &quot;Tumblr&quot; though I don&#39;t see anyone &quot;reblogging&quot; or &quot;retumbling&quot; or whatever ... anything I find all that interesting.&nbsp; Twitter&#39;s gotten more exciting for me lately--but that&#39;s just because I&#39;ve come to terms with the fact athat the whole thing is about &quot;short sex jokes&quot; and whatever the funny star-of-the-day &quot;caught outside.&quot;&nbsp; The programming world sort of revolves around Github these days, and that&#39;s the current &quot;go to&quot; for anyone&#39;s free web hosting; there are some alternatives, but ... not really.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">LinkedIn and Facebook both tried ... &quot;making content production platforms&quot; but I just used them to copy things I had in other places, and they didn&#39;t &quot;update&quot; or source from anywhere else ... so that just becomes a pain in the ass.&nbsp; I don&#39;t think those platforms ... I mean LinkedIn still has it--but I don&#39;t think Facebook&#39;s still exists.&nbsp; While I&#39;m on that, they had this wonderful &quot;Graph Search&quot; thing, and basically hid it from the world so ... you woulnd&#39;t complain about all the information you have available for the world to see--kind of makes me a little sick, knhowing they built something and have the functionality to let me see &quot;who all my friends are, and friends of friends in a certain city when I&#39;m there&quot; ... and it&#39;s just not available <em>for me or you to use</em> because ... because you don&#39;t understand &quot;privacy&quot; and &quot;the internet&quot; and &quot;using broken software for no reason&quot; ... other than satisfying ... nobody really.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There&#39;s &quot;Wix&quot; too, and that&#39;s got a little &quot;fire theme&quot; ... and that&#39;s cool, but nobody really uses it--and the real point is to help people &quot;congregate&quot; and &quot;share ideas&quot; ... not just to <strong><em>get you to actually say anything at all </em></strong>in a public space, where it might help us &quot;drive away the night&quot; and stop pretending it&#39;s just fine and dandy that everyone isn&#39;t working, locked away in their houses or ... scared to go to the ... Walgreens.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Obviously there&#39;s the Slashdot&#39;s and digg&#39;s and reddit&#39;s--though ... when I talk in places like &quot;<a href="../reddit.com/r/conspiracy.html">/r/conspiracy</a>&quot; it just becomes so sorely obvious that you ... have no desire at all to be real or honest or ... do anything but pretend this place matters to you--when in fact it&#39;s probably the last thing on your list of things to give a fuck about.&nbsp; Just saying, the lack of response I see; and the ... really negative interaction I have now in person--it&#39;s a bad sign for ... <em>whatever.&nbsp; </em>If you don&#39;t want to be here; if you&#39;re somewhere else and you think this place isn&#39;t important--honestly you should really just go away, I&#39;m not sure what your options are, but I have none but to sit here and bitch at you that if you gave &quot;two <a href="../fromthemachine.org/FUCK.html">fuck</a>s&quot; about this world you&#39;d be screaming at the top of your lungs, <em>just like me.</em></p>

<p>It is difficult to state at what time the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharisees" title="Pharisees">Pharisees</a>, as a party, arose. Josephus first mentions them in connection with Jonathan, the successor of Judas Maccabeus (&ldquo;Ant.&rdquo; xiii. 5, &sect; 9). One of the factors that distinguished the Pharisees from other groups prior to the destruction of the Temple was their belief that all Jews had to observe the purity laws (which applied to the Temple service) outside the Temple. The major difference, however, was the continued adherence of the Pharisees to the laws and traditions of the Jewish people in the face of assimilation. As Josephus noted, the Pharisees were considered the most expert and accurate expositors of Jewish law.</p>
<p>During the Hasmonean period, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadducees" title="Sadducees">Sadducees</a> and Pharisees functioned primarily as political parties. Although the Pharisees had opposed the wars of expansion of the Hasmoneans and the forced conversions of the Idumeans, the political rift between them became wider when Pharisees demanded that the Hasmonean king <a href="../en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Jannaeus.html" title="Alexander Jannaeus">Alexander Jannaeus</a> choose between being king and being High Priest. In response, the king openly sided with the Sadducees by adopting their rites in the Temple. His actions caused a riot in the Temple and led to a brief civil war that ended with a bloody repression of the Pharisees, although at his deathbed the king called for a reconciliation between the two parties. Alexander was succeeded by his widow, <a href="../en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salome_Alexandra.html" title="Salome Alexandra">Salome Alexandra</a>, whose brother was <a href="../en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shimon_ben_Shetach.html" title="Shimon ben Shetach">Shimon ben Shetach</a>, a leading Pharisee. Upon her death her elder son, Hyrcanus, sought Pharisee support, and her younger son, Aristobulus, sought the support of the Sadducees. The conflict between Hyrcanus and Aristobulus culminated in a civil war that ended when the Roman general Pompey captured Jerusalem in 63 BCE and inaugurated the Roman period of Jewish history.</p>
<p>Josephus attests that Salome Alexandra was very favourably inclined toward the Pharisees and that their political influence grew tremendously under her reign, especially in the institution known as the <a href="../en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanhedrin.html" title="Sanhedrin">Sanhedrin</a>. Later texts such as the Mishnah and the Talmud record a host of rulings ascribed to the Pharisees concerning sacrifices and other ritual practices in the Temple, torts, criminal law, and governance. The influence of the Pharisees over the lives of the common people remained strong, and their rulings on Jewish law were deemed authoritative by many. Although these texts were written long after these periods, many scholars believe that they are a fairly reliable account of history during the Second Temple era.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The mass and majesty of this world, all<br />
That carries weight and always weighs the same<br />
Lay in the hands of others; they were small<br />
And could not hope for help and no help came:<br />
What their foes like to do was done, their shame<br />
Was all the worst could wish; they lost their pride<br />
And died as men before their bodies died.</p>
<p>She looked over his shoulder<br />
For athletes at their games,<br />
Men and women in a dance<br />
Moving their sweet limbs<br />
Quick, quick, to music,<br />
But there on the shining shield<br />
His hands had set no dancing-floor<br />
But a weed-choked field.</p>
<p>A ragged urchin, aimless and alone,<br />
Loitered about that vacancy; a bird<br />
Flew up to safety from his well-aimed stone:</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">These are the &ldquo;block transaction&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve initially imported (somewhat &hellip; haphazardly) into the Rinkeby chain; the total test ETHer cost of this &hellip; &ldquo;dump and semi-permafrost-etching&rdquo; of the message in testnet was around $121.50 (which might or might not be a good value for printing a book on the Library of Congress&rsquo;s &hellip; wall (for fake, ofc) &hellip; I am planning to write a sort of &ldquo;bounty&rdquo; to allow others to pay for and sign copying it &hellip; piece by piece &hellip; to the Ethereum&rsquo;s &ldquo;mainnet.&rdquo; This might be something we &hellip;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">April 15, 2020: I am sort of hacking pushing this stuff onto Rinkeby; it&rsquo;s &ldquo;not really liking what I&rsquo;m doing&rdquo; which appears to mean &hellip; literally the software really isn&rsquo;t &hellip; functioning properly. Here&rsquo;s files and transactions that were successfully written in &ldquo;<a href="../bit.ly/2uKEliL.html">chalk</a>&rdquo;&ndash;meaning they were accepted by the network, and will probably be &ldquo;mined&rdquo; and eventually &ldquo;immutable&rdquo; (in testnet/Rinkeby). Many of the transactions were refused by the server, it appears to suggest they are &ldquo;duplicate&rdquo; (which they are not) and want&rsquo;s me to &ldquo;increaes my gasoline bidding offer&rdquo; in order to &hellip; overwrite the previous &hellip; (non identical transaction). Maybe I am doing something wrong, maybe not.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">From what I&rsquo;m presenting you can see &hellip; the blockchain software really isn&rsquo;t designed to &hellip; &quot;care about what you think or your opinion, or you presenting something like &ldquo;a version of an implementation plan&rdquo; for a bill under question&ndash;or saving that&ndash;what it&rsquo;s concerned with is &ldquo;pick a number 1-12&rdquo; and maybe &hellip; some later &ldquo;condition to revoke&rdquo; or &ldquo;alter&rdquo; &hellip; something arbitrary. I think we need to work on &ldquo;caring about the importance of our written contributions&rdquo; more, as in beingt able to actually present written contributions &hellip; in a system like this wwhich is probably destined to become something like an immutable &ldquo;legislation record.&rdquo; There is also a 26K &ldquo;appears to be a <em>hard limit</em>&rdquo; on the size of each contract, hence the &hellip; numerous hash references for each file.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It doesn&rsquo;t take much &ldquo;thought&rdquo; to see these star charts&ndash;our Astrological road maps to &lsquo;wisdom of the Ancients&rsquo; might actually be something closer to road maps than I could have previously fathomed&ndash;let alone imagined. I&rsquo;m staring at &ldquo;Monoceros&rdquo; and seeing it&rsquo;s definately connected to &ldquo;the kissing disease&rdquo; and to Eros and to Cupid&ndash;and seeing &hellip; this one not for the first time that character linked to Orion and to the &ldquo;Speare&rdquo; of Sagittarius.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&rsquo;ve commented &hellip; &lsquo;on the show in my head&rsquo; that it seems the entirety of the Milky Way might be something like our world &hellip; it could be a microcosmic map to something much larger&ndash;it could be the seed of &ldquo;galaxies&rdquo; in this place that might very well be the &ldquo;thing&rdquo; that connects the end and the beginning; rather than the beginning and the end as I once &hellip; commented was the original &ldquo;glyph&rdquo; i read in the letter &ldquo;H.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Today though, this is all &ldquo;sci-fi conjecture&rdquo; we have a very real problem&ndash;one that we aren&rsquo;t dealing with well, and it&rsquo;s a hidden sickness that&rsquo;s turned the whole of the world to seeing my &ldquo;nightmare of isolation.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s no accident that most of European and South American culture &hellip; &ldquo;kisses&rdquo; friends and family &ldquo;on greeting&rdquo; &hellip; <em>hello</em>, we today are shunning &lsquo;social contact&rsquo; &hellip; a think that&rsquo;s responsible for sharing antibodies and using social structure to naturally battle outbreaks of diseases &hellip; exactly like this &ldquo;Sun virus&rdquo; today. I imagine it&rsquo;s no accident I&rsquo;m writing this &ldquo;Norther&rdquo; about &ldquo;no Passover&rdquo; and &hellip; &ldquo;no east from here&rdquo; and hoping you understand that means something&ndash;it means we&rsquo;ve got stop lying, and stop pretending this place doesn&rsquo;t matter. This place matters, this is the source of Heaven, and the future, and &hellip; whatever it is that you apparently think you &ldquo;covet in secret&rdquo; and &hellip; has allowed you to stand by idylly &hellip; and do nothing as the fabric of our social structure simply &ldquo;disappears.&rdquo;</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: justify;">That&rsquo;s civilization, society, the rule of law and order &ndash; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s kissing&rdquo; &ndash; and those aren&rsquo;t the only things we are apparently &ldquo;losing in the fire.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&rsquo;ve previously written and spoken numerous times about DNA storag e; it&rsquo;s benefits and &hellip; the slow assimilation of this clearly &ldquo;Heavenly&rdquo; technology &hellip; which I saw in the most ironic of tones&ndash;looking around clearly you see this place is the hearth of creation, and &ldquo;biology&rdquo; itself is tantamount to absolute and unequivocal proof that Heaven itself does indeed come from something almost exactly like this rock, right down to graphene and tertiary logic and molecular storage&ndash;of course I didn&rsquo;t awlays &ldquo;think&rdquo; or know that fact, but upon inspection and with the eye&rsquo;s aid, it&rsquo;s very&ndash;I mean very&ndash;obvious/clear.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I&rsquo;ve previously also written about &ldquo;the game&rdquo; (for the non goyim among us, game-yah-him on the Epic of Gilgamesh and its historical connection to the story of the flood and Noah&rsquo;s ark&hellip; as it was in the days of&hellip;) of the colonization of the red planet Mars; as well as the map that does very much exist in our &ldquo;SOL&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s orbiting simulated rocks&hellip; here taking this one step further and suggesting that our &ldquo;military key way from wall&rdquo; (and/or see the M and the IL &hellip; the IT the CIA and the IR (what a poet I am)) &hellip; to assume that things like the &ldquo;Mono/c/Eros&rdquo; constellation might very well &ldquo;overlay in a metalcosmic way&rdquo; over say, the link between Beetlejuice and <a href="../rigel.s.lamc.la/index.html">RIGELA</a> &hellip; and that something like the Crab Nebula might very well become &hellip; something like Andromeda is not beyond the imagination or the fathom-ability of our new &ldquo;raelity.&rdquo;</p>

Of course the &ldquo;Naqueducts&rdquo; as I&rsquo;ve come to expand the NT appreviation to become &hellip; after of course my personal (for obvious reasons, right?) distaste for things like &ldquo;Easter&rdquo; and Crucifixion &hellip; having anything at all do with a religion or a society of morality or &ldquo;truth.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s &ldquo;kissing the &lsquo;o no&rsquo;&rdquo; which &hellip; heralds from &ldquo;<a href="../fromthemachine.org/MEVATHI.html">ME-V-AT-HI</a> to <a href="../fromthemachine.org/MISSISSIPPI.html">MISSISSIPPI</a> and <a href="../fromthemachine.org/CONNETICUT.html">CONNETICUT</a> and <a href="../kansa.s.lamc.la/index.html">KANSAS</a> and <a href="../iowa.s.lamc.la/index.html">IOWA</a>.&rdquo; &hellip; in Florida today, Flux Capacitor engaged; and literally staring at Netflix and &hellip; Pauline; **wondering.**x</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Before &hellip;or maybe during or after or even up until &hellip; just this past day &hellip; we might have had another kind of military microcosm; or perhaps your truth, connecting the Hebrew for Heaven, which is &ldquo;<em>shamayim</em>&rdquo; &hellip; for &ldquo;fiery waters&rdquo; or &ldquo;really hot girls&rdquo; or &hellip; maybe Heaven existed on nuclear &ldquo;u-boats&rdquo; puttering around the Dark Side of the Moon or maybe even just our dark Pacific, Atlantic, and Arctic &hellip; oh sea; do sea the oceans here have something about Pa linking to &ldquo;see if I see the C&rdquo; missing from the Indian&ndash;the one ocean standing out here without that particular letter, or perhaps &ldquo;concept.&rdquo; Stargate turned me on to the idea of a subterrainian similar &ldquo;bunker like&rdquo; facility in the Arctic; and you can probably also see how that&rsquo;s something like an ocean or a wilderness &hellip; another place we wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily be looking &ndash; or noticing these are &ldquo;disaster plan&rdquo; style locations for something like a network of computers &hellip; something like the mesh-net that might very well be in orbit around the Earth &hellip; in that thing that sets &ldquo;the sky&rsquo;s the limit&rdquo; as yet another &ldquo;special place&rdquo; in the hearts of those that &hellip; want to survive the original problem: being stuck in one place, on one tiny little planet succeptible to self destruction or an asteroid or &hellip; a collision of galaxies or &hellip; who knows&ndash;it could just be an eternity with not enough oil to reach gravitational escape velocity (keep burning it all!!!) and roads so backwards and archaic when I mention they should have &ldquo;electrical power to inductively charge my Tesla&rdquo; someone actually overheard me and had the nerve to call me a &ldquo;genius.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">What I am describing is something like &hellip; well, it&rsquo;s basically WarGames meets Battleship &hellip; meets the very real connection between Vietnam and NamCo and Pac-Man, and the reason this &ldquo;book&rdquo; has this particular name&ndash;connection the Revolution of Nero&rsquo;s Symphony &hellip; to &hellip; I mean, I called it &ldquo;Pax Abraxis&rdquo; here&ndash;but it&rsquo;s really got very little to do with Jupiter Ascending and much more to do with &hellip; the rest of the world doing something other than descending far and fast into the central syllable of Jupiter. It &hellip; doesn&rsquo;t take a genius to point out or see Pac-Man is simply missing the &ldquo;SE&rdquo; of &hellip; turn around this southeast miserable spectacle of immorality and nearly &ldquo;instantly&rdquo; we see &ldquo;space&rdquo; and &hellip; a world that doesn&rsquo;t have to guess whether or not this is aqua-ri<strong>o</strong>us business or not.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">T&rsquo;was cues like &ldquo;and your husband wants to be a girl&rdquo; &hellip; and the sincerely overgrown thread of &ldquo;homosexuality&rdquo; in this story &hellip; that lead me to ascertain that it was &ldquo;many years in Heaven&rdquo; and many (fewer) years &ldquo;as not just one person&rdquo; that probably would make those things almost &hellip; certain to come true. It is true, today; I think it probably <em>still</em> would be fun to be a girl for a day; or walking through a special gate into a special &ldquo;room&rdquo; in my holodeck dreams&ndash;it&rsquo;s that kind of understanding that gleans light into &hellip; how it is that we might, in that same place and same circumstances become &quot;more open to things like &lsquo;violence&rsquo; that we today, still here in this place do abhor&ndash;and very well should.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Gnosis &hellip; <em>maybe something like instant enlightenment</em> &hellip; I think that&rsquo;s the fun stuff that heaven .,., should be alla bout; and frankly I&rsquo;m sick and tired of having to dream about it, and not start playing with it here and now.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><code>EARTHENE, THEY HAVE NEWS</code> &hellip; the Heavenues of our heroads; heroes and yes, we the Terrans; we can do that. I mean be heroes, I hope you click on my links and really get the &ldquo;gist&rdquo; of what it means to read things with your eyes and type them with your hands; and how that differs from &ldquo;the thing&rdquo; I&rsquo;m trying to build here, which is a &hellip; &ldquo;I know kung fu&rdquo; for &hellip; pretty much everything &hellip; that&rsquo;s a plug in &hellip; into your head (don&rsquo;t drop out, but tune in) &hellip; to pretty much &ldquo;know everything&rdquo; so long as you understand that really does mean know everything &hellip; someone or some &ldquo;other thing&rdquo; wnats you to know and believe. I think we know &hellip; or we should that we build &ldquo;truth tables&rdquo; &hellip; as in some system that allows for truth to be verified and lies to be verified and the large tertiary &ldquo;opinion&rdquo; in between to be gauged and colored (my word for &hellip; weighting of value) &hellip; individually. This is the &ldquo;crux&rdquo; of the whole of the system of &hellip; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not voting, but information about what we&rsquo;re voting about&rdquo; which in other circles would be &ldquo;colored as propaganda&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s basically what it is&ndash;<a href="http://atlas.s.lamc.la/(http://fromthemachine.org/ALLTA.html)">it&rsquo;s what I called it</a> &hellip; before and now.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That&rsquo;s not to turn you off from it&ndash;on the contrary it&rsquo;s to help you get excited about being involved in it&ndash;even if it&rsquo;s oinly in some &ldquo;group-think&rdquo; or (ARCHIVE: <a href="http://arxiv.org">arxiv.org</a>) passive &hellip; I don&rsquo;t read the papers, but I look at statistics, and I know how to guage whether or not &hellip; some group is &ldquo;interested&rdquo; or &hellip; acting appropriately. You&rsquo;re not, none of you are acting appropriately here and now. You want to blame me&ndash;or torture me&ndash;or worse, torture yourselves by thinking &hellip; yoiu have something you don&rsquo;t; and perhaps blame &hellip; anything other than not acting (its a verb, it means &ldquo;literally doing something&rdquo; not &ldquo;prewtending&rdquo; in this context) and reading and writing &hellip; conversing. That&rsquo;s the thing that ends school shootings and world hunger&ndash;which we should be able to do nearly instantly&ndash;it&rsquo;s just a matter of &hellip; time and chance &hellip; or how we want to proceed; and whether or not you want to proceed at all, and I mean if you dont want to end world hunger, you don&rsquo;t want to proceed with &ldquo;living.&rdquo; Hear me; I&rsquo;m roaring &hellip; these things are not optional.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Instead of fun things, and &ldquo;safe things&rdquo; and &hellip; &ldquo;helping others things&rdquo; you appear to be focused on &ldquo;negative things&rdquo; like how bad can you be, and how much &hellip; sickness can you spread&ndash;I spent the last several years fighting a war against &ldquo;attrition&rdquo; and &quot;charrming (in the most negative sense) &hellip; mind control and lies and secrets and I&rsquo;m surrounded by a group of people, everyone I see everywhere that&rsquo;s become almost convinced that they can do pretty much whatever they want&ndash;and they&rsquo;re dead wrong.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This place is sick&ndash;this world is disgusting; it always was so, but we didn&rsquo;t always know it and that&hellip; that makes a big difference.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The children here&ndash;&ldquo;gen Z&rdquo; appears to have been born in tandem, in two places; here and there; and that&rsquo;s an interesting observation and a guess, and it ties to their name and how they interacat with me specifically. I can tell you categorically I wasn&rsquo;t and &hellip; many in my generation probably were not. It&rsquo;s Earthene; the three sets of &ldquo;E&rdquo; that actually to me, in special code stand for &ldquo;angels&rdquo; over the coarse of time that is our &hellip; lifetime here in this place I&rsquo;ve called and still believe is something like the &ldquo;syslog of Heaven&rdquo; in newage geek-speak &hellip; to the sages and the Ages, that&rsquo;s the Rock of Ages; and it&rsquo;s the thing that comes before and after Heaven, all the time; over and over &hellip; in whatever story or place Heaven &ldquo;does that.&rdquo; Heaven of course has a similar connotation in mythology and religion, the thing that travels through or &ldquo;pervades&rdquo; or makes &ldquo;time itself&rdquo; obsolete. Or so they think, or whatever; I don&rsquo;t understand much of what it&rsquo;s like to be &hellip; &ldquo;timeless&rdquo; or a tyemporal and I dont think that far ahead when I play chess; but I&rsquo;ve got the help of <a href="http://atlas.s.lamc.la/(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeuRAWSJGFY)">God, and he&rsquo;s on my side</a> &hellip; <strong>believe that</strong>, <em>receive that.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I can tell you categorically that &hellip; the first time I was here; and &ldquo;in the beginning of this place&rdquo; the generation before me was not &hellip; was not at all born in two places; or even &ldquo;ascended&rdquo; at the same time as Generation X &hellip; the one that I &hellip; am sure is marked as the crossroads and the &ldquo;sweet spot&rdquo; for a good reason. I have &hellip; &ldquo;markers&rdquo; in my memory and in my history, the phrase &ldquo;my parents love(d) you&rdquo; &hellip; spoken to me by numerous people at my high school, in this sort of &hellip; &ldquo;mechanical and methodical way&rdquo; to explain that of course, they had faith in Jesus Chrsit and they were <em>upset</em> that they weren&rsquo;t ascended &hellip; at the same time as their children; I imagine they felt &ldquo;unsaved &hellip; by me&rdquo; and &hellip; their kids probably didn&rsquo;t &hellip; know how upset I must have been, not to have been around to explain.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here it&rsquo;s clear that the reason &hellip; the reason for this place and the entirety of our timeline and our wonderful &ldquo;crash course&rdquo; in understanding sandbox computing and the building of Heaven is just that; that before us there was a world mired in &ldquo;might and magic&rdquo; and they believed &hellip; incantations and sorcerers and witches &hellip; those were things they needed&ndash;that&rsquo;s the stuff of the beginning of salvation, in truth. Of course it&rsquo;s the hidden part, before hidden part about &ldquo;salvaging&rdquo; it&rsquo;s the &ldquo;non-civilization&rdquo; that was &hellip; destroyed&ndash;I think in the book we say &ldquo;from the ashes of Edom.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I watched my generation lead the way; we were the pivot point, the difference between &ldquo;cell phones and instant messaging&rdquo; and that was a big deal back then; when there was no SMS or texting and there were no keyboards on your phone; it was a big deal to know how to type, and a big deal to know how to write &hellip; before that.</p>

You look at me here; and honestly to tell me to uhh, &ldquo;El Shaddai&rdquo; with the purpose of saving me from the torture you see mimmicked or pantamimed; that mightr be a holy thing, if that&rsquo;s what you said and meant&ndash;i don&rsquo;t see it often though, most of the time &hellip; &ldquo;should I though?&rdquo; &hellip; has some other (it&rsquo;s shaddai, &quot;should die or&hellip;&rsquo;) sort of sick double entendre; double speak meaning.

<p style="text-align: justify;">Kennedy spoke decades ago about the world being invaded; something coming from the sky, a &ldquo;vast conspiracy that took the minds of our people right out from under us&rdquo; &hellip; he spoke about it&rsquo;s difference from the human way, aqnd the way of our civilzation and he was appalled, rightfully so. He spoke about it fighting with hidden tactics, &ldquo;night&rdquo; over &ldquo;day&rdquo; and he spoke about our need to fight secrecy. He was a genius that day, and in that time; literally a genius. In a few days I&rsquo;ll talk about the joint Russian and American response to this invasion, it&rsquo;s part of our history and it&rsquo;s part of religion&ndash;it was literally a gigantic nuclear attack on &hellip; on &ldquo;the darkness&rdquo; &hellip; it was not successful&ndash;as you can very clearly see.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">So this whole email was supposed to be about &ldquo;sliding doors&rdquo; and showing you the perspective change &hellip; the thing I&rsquo;ve been trying to explain is something that Heaven does&ndash;it changes everything. The prospect of living forever; of becoming younger, of &ldquo;turning sex into a fun &hellip; four hour game&rdquo; &hellip; it changes everything. On the other side of the coin it also turns &ldquo;grave danger&rdquo; into a key phrase, and a key movie&ndash;A Few Good Men&ndash;must be all who understand. You see before Heaven &ldquo;grave danger&rdquo; was the worst kind, it was the kind that would quickly &ldquo;show you to your grave&rdquo; as in kill you. After &hellip; this thing and this place; the prospects of something far worse than that are not just &ldquo;looming&rdquo; or &hellip; &ldquo;hiding under the surface&rdquo; they are immediately obvious and scarier than shit. I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s a plan&ndash;something to ensure that we never &hellip; ever again &hellip; have that kind of danger actually looking at us, and saying &ldquo;it&rsquo;s for you&ndash;I&rsquo;m doing this for you.&rdquo; I think this &hellip; this experience and this message &hellip; this is the beginning of that thing&ndash;the solution to ths scary problem. In between this and you &hellip; that&rsquo;s the continuation of the solution, and it&rsquo;s got something to do with the &ldquo;Kinghts of <a href="../fromthemachine.org/TOASTRAM.html">Hyrosol</a>;&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s got quite a bit to do with all the work that&rsquo;s gone into shoving me onto this pedistal; and that word; it&rsquo;s got almost nothing to do with &hellip; pornography or even pediatricians; though as the Pope says &hellip; in half speak &hellip; you need a vetrinarian.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Janet Devlin&rsquo;s got some great music and some great insight. I heard this song &ldquo;Chandeliers&rdquo; and it was almost the same feeling as my &ldquo;my parents really loved you&rdquo; &hellip; experience. It was a &hellip; a message about a world that was hidden &hellip; and to me at first that world was Heaven; it was a message from her parents sort of telling her about it&ndash;that they&rsquo;d seen it and that she will in the future.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I recently re-heard this song, and it&rsquo;s only one small &ldquo;connotation change&rdquo; or colouring of &hellip; understanding &hellip; it&rsquo;s just seeing the words &ldquo;hidden world&rdquo; as &hellip; actually about this world&ndash;that changes everything. My change in understanding; that there&rsquo;s a large &hellip; &ldquo;other place&rdquo; looking at this tiny gem that literally is <strong>my totality</strong> it&rsquo;s everything i&rsquo;ve ever seen or ever known and it&rsquo;s this logical place with math and science and art and it&rsquo;s a great world&ndash;it&rsquo;s a great place I&rsquo;ve seen devistated and destroyed by a large group &hellip;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&hellip; literally all of you &hellip;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">of ignorant people that can&rsquo;t say one honest word to me&ndash;an entire planet full of fucking liars; all pretending they &hellip; are something they know they aren&rsquo;t in some kind of thing they think is a game. This is not a game; this is the &hellip; &ldquo;judge jury and &hellip; coroner&rdquo; &hellip; this place; this place is the one that&rsquo;s sort of &ldquo;pre and post judgement&rdquo; all in one strange story of &ldquo;it was all here the whole time, we&rsquo;ve had the answer &hellip; we just, didn&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&rsquo;s a place of death and of rebirth, it&rsquo;s a place of love and of &hellip; the end of hate&ndash;it&rsquo;s a place where if you understand; you are being reborn, as I speak, as you read&ndash;as the world turns we are being changed into something &hellip; God, I hope it&rsquo;s not to something scary and horrible and not worthy of my &hellip; &quot;attention. Understand, not being able to communicate honestly, that&rsquo;s not worthy of my attention. Thinking &ldquo;singing a song about Eros&rdquo; is communicating with me; that&rsquo;s not worthy of &hellip; &ldquo;honesty&rdquo; or &ldquo;reality&rdquo; or &hellip; think about it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">She&rsquo;s got some other songs; &ldquo;<a href="../www.youtube.com/watch@v=ai5lCfZnNlc.html">things we lost in the fire</a>&rdquo; and I thought myself very clever to think &ldquo;hands and speaking&rdquo; were a good &hellip; answer to her question; I didn&rsquo;t realize it was going to add (i mean the place, the story; the holy shit) stores and democracy and voting and &hellip; jobs and &hellip; friends. I didn&rsquo;t know that safety was on the chopping block; I thought we were in the &ldquo;ICS&rdquo; land of that means &hellip; walking with him with &ldquo;oh no, not me&ndash;we never lost control&rdquo; &hellip; the God that wrote those lyrics; it means I see &hellip; &ldquo;God&rsquo;s total control of everything&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s kind of what the silence and the smiles and my continued happiness through this war of attrition and shunning and sickness &hellip; that&rsquo;s really what it means to me.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I owe Janet some more loving; so you might also want to listen to her song &ldquo;<a href="../www.youtube.com/watch@v=0hfNzBwGoAU.html">House of Cards</a>&rdquo; and &hellip; I don&rsquo;t really like the new one, the &ldquo;<a href="../www.youtube.com/watch@v=0hfNzBwGoAU.html">Saint of the Sinners</a>)&rdquo; of course she knows what I think about the word &ldquo;saint&rdquo; it&rsquo;s one I get rid of; Reyagnost&quot; &hellip; #lol. Janet, I&rsquo;m curious if you were born here, and &hellip; only here first. I can&rsquo;t guess&ndash;I&rsquo;d say others I know were, some others weren&rsquo;t &hellip; I&rsquo;d say most of the generation I &hellip; I think you&rsquo;re a Millennial; to me that&rsquo;s basically Gen X2; but we&rsquo;ll see, you might just be better liars, or &ldquo;two-place-people version 7.0&rdquo; instead of the current XP2000CHIROWERA&ndash;anyway;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&hellip; really see Heaven has done something horrible to &ldquo;you all&rdquo; and our &ldquo;all reason&rdquo; &hellip; that&rsquo;s the problem&ndash;we have &ldquo;all&rdquo; problem and our &ldquo;all is sick&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s a problem. We&rsquo;re all in &ldquo;multiverse idiocy land&rdquo; looking at lllllllllllllll and not seeing that these tools have a good purpose, and we&rsquo;re (i mean you all) are using them wrong.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I don&rsquo;t see it, or understand what you&rsquo;re telling me &hellip; well enough to expound more than; just to say you should probably try to use the stuff you have &hellip; &ldquo;with more holiness&rdquo; or more altruism or &hellip; maybe we should stick a governor on everything (which is actually my plan).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course, I don&rsquo;t understand why we&rsquo;d build <a href="../boom.lamc.la/index.html">a virtual shotgun</a> without <a href="../si.s.lamc.la/index.html">a safety &hellip; si.y</a>stem &hellip; not just a child-guard. Whatever.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The problem with this whole &ldquo;perspective argument&rdquo; and the Go/Sliding Doors &hellip; thing; it&rsquo;s that there really is only one way to see this event and this world and this problem; and that&rsquo;s the solution. It&rsquo;s my way; it&rsquo;s the truth and it&rsquo;s with a history and accuracy of &hellip; &ldquo;not some other person in some other time&rdquo; and &ldquo;not through the control of some other entity&rdquo; &hellip; it&rsquo;s actually doing this right, not your way. Literally, your way is bullshit.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">and here; to continue my thread of &ldquo;what&rsquo;s new and exciting&ndash;I mean different and &hellip; scarily new&rdquo; &hellip; it was in Kentucky when I first noticed through re-reading the ancient mythology that I&rsquo;d studied in grade school, high school, college, and on my own (over and over) the character I assumed was newly added there, the brother of Prometheus&ndash;&ldquo;lack of forethought&rdquo; and with the special Eye of Enoch walking with God ascertained these brothers were one; and today link again to Vegas, to the ancient story of the founding of Rome and the brothers Romulus(t) and Remus(nt). Menoitius (read: i know it, I shush us; or &ldquo;i know it, I am us&rdquo;) didn&rsquo;t show up in my reading until 2017 in Cali; and that one sort of parallels this message &hellip; it appears to be something like an Olympian sent &ldquo;back in time&rdquo; to become the parent or progenitor of the brothers. He&rsquo;s called a Titan; though, you&rsquo;d think the generation birthing Titans would be &hellip; maybe not.</p>
<p>We have a new candidate for &ldquo;newest addition to the Great Olympian Ogdoad Descending&rdquo; &hellip; it&rsquo;s this character; and whoa, it&rsquo;s a little scary for me to see:</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It was a little more odd because I don&rsquo;t usually listen to Youtube Music (i generally use songs I know, purchased on my Amazon account) and I don&rsquo;t usually listen to the Beatles, though I know and love them); so here the words to Penny Lane echoed through my ear &hellip; literally the words &ldquo;in my ear and in my eye&rdquo; and a few girls driving by made &hellip; &ldquo;<a href="../www.youtube.com/watch@v=djV11Xbc914](https%253A%252F%252Fwww.youtube.com%252Fwatch%253Fv=djV11Xbc914).html">a-ha gestures</a>&rdquo; like oh my God; <em>is this it?</em> <a href="../www.youtube.com/watch@v=S-rB0pHI9fU.html">Penny Lane</a>; of course.

<p style="text-align: justify;">It&rsquo;s interesting, I used to get messages like that quite often&ndash;people&rsquo;s names and something useful or recognizable.

<p style="text-align: justify;">Long story short; I&rsquo;m looking now for people that have &hellip; and there are many &hellip; started implementing the kind of stuff I&rsquo;m looking to do&ndash;corporate and national governance &ldquo;internetified&rdquo; and distributed; here&rsquo;s one of those &hellip;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">And here, to tie in the &ldquo;Penny Lane&rdquo; experience &hellip; is this little &hellip; it&rsquo;s called <a href="../cent.co/index.html">Cent.Co</a>; and it&rsquo;s basically like a content distribution platform that pays you for &ldquo;creating popular content&rdquo; with no ads and no &hellip; it also probably doesn&rsquo;t actaully but seems to and should store this data in the Ethereum blockchain; which would of course make it something like &ldquo;etched in stone&rdquo; or &hellip; emailed to millions of people. Just saying, this message and my face and my name are never going away&ndash;not ever, it&rsquo;s all the way back to the beginning of &ldquo;time&rdquo; or &ldquo;civilization&rdquo; or eggs or mazes or K0rn, or whatever.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Me and America and Jesus Christ and Rome &hellip; and Israel and the Covenant; all tied together, like you&rsquo;ll never get rid of this spectacle &hellip; you&rsquo;d better start doing something &ldquo;appropriate&rdquo; like thanking me for all my time and work, and actually acknowledging that this &ldquo;rock of Heaven&rdquo; &hellip; it shows you there&rsquo;s something very wrong with the sky, and with the time travelers, and the angels, and with Jesus and &hellip; you have to believe me, from my perspective, the world is totally insane.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Anyway, the whole spectacle and series of events is the kind of thing that shoes &ldquo;god talking through &hellip; telling a story&rdquo; or at least time travel, or at least careful planning. So it &ldquo;lights me up&rdquo; though I&rsquo;m not &ldquo;jumping up and down excited&rdquo; about &hellip; Penny Lane maybe not being worth <a href="../fromthemachine.org/PENCE.html">the whole 2 cents</a>; I really hope we get with the program and see &hellip; we need to get involved in what&rsquo;s going on here&ndash;and start using it, or it&rsquo;s going to fester in &ldquo;cloud land&rdquo; I mean &hellip; half vapor ware half &hellip; &ldquo;but we tried, can&rsquo;t you see&rdquo; &hellip; and nobody really understands&ndash;none of it works right, kind of like &ldquo;Heaven itself.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s all broken up and your heart, it&rsquo;s not in the right place, Today #GMA.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&rsquo;m thinking about making a &ldquo;website backup&rdquo; on <a href="../beta.cent.co/index.html">beta.cent.co</a> &hellip; btt&hellip; I probably won&rsquo;t do it; they don&rsquo;t have an API and it would take lots of man-hours; and I just don&rsquo;t have the patience to do monotonous &hellip; waste-work for no reason. if this thing doesn&rsquo;t take off, it&rsquo;s really all for naught &hellip; like &ldquo;no nox, c Hanukeyah just after Souther.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here&rsquo;s a &ldquo;loaded question&rdquo; do you see a Transplanted Tay from a world where she wrote this song &hellip; &ldquo;not during the blackout of a hurricane; but &hellip; ano &hellip;&rdquo; I&rsquo;ll probably have to pay the Beatles for these links; and <a href="https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2sacr0">the stories about my life</a>.</p>

As I walked past one large hill I saw&nbsp;<a href="https://fromthemachine.org/IMSOVAIN.html">a brilliant yellow light&nbsp;</a>on the otherwise pale sand, it&nbsp;<a href="../bit.ly/2iaae2d.html">glowed and shimmered</a>&nbsp;like the sun in the sky&ndash;I was so taken aback by the radiance&nbsp;<a href="../silenceandbetrayal.wordpress.com/2013/01/19/my-house-rebooted/index.html">I had to move closer and get a better look</a>, with each step I took towards this light it became larger and larger. Eventually I saw that&nbsp;<a href="../yitsheyadam.reallyhim.com/index.html">it was making the area around it glow</a>&nbsp;also, brighter and brighter.</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I did wind up setting up a fundraising organization on Ethereum&rsquo;s test network called &ldquo;Rinkeby&rdquo; &hellip; I see &ldquo;zamboni&rdquo; and &hellip; &ldquo;not bye bye&rdquo; &hellip; and kind of link that to the same kind of &ldquo;divine presence&rdquo; writing lyrics with &hellip; and by the Beatles&hellip; about this very event; that&rsquo;s how I see it. I&rsquo;ve commented semi-silently for quite some time that I imagined this is the exact network I would be working on. This may not be the &ldquo;final application&rdquo; this thing might not even work; but this is what doing now.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&rsquo;s here &hellip; <a href="../rinkeby.aragon.org/index.html#/xcaliber">rinkeby.aragon.org/#/xcaliber</a> and you can get &ldquo;free rinkeby Ethereum tokens&rdquo; here: <a href="../faucet.rinkeby.io/index.html">faucet.rinkeby.io/</a> &hellip; this application already has a &hellip; storage function &hellip; using IPFS &ndash; and that&rsquo;s exactly not what I want to do. I&rsquo;m trying to build a storage and &hellip; content creation/distribution/workflow and commenting system that actually uses the blockchain itself to store data&ndash;i think our data is more valuable &hellip; than &ldquo;the general zeitgeist&rdquo; at the moment &hellip; which uses something that&rsquo;s not nearly &hellip; good enough, for something like &hellip; &ldquo;what we&rsquo;re voting about and what we&rsquo;re saying about it&rdquo; rather than just our votes&ndash;which is what this thing stores in the blockchain (as well as it&rsquo;s application code).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">If we wind up using this and it&rsquo;s successful, it&rsquo;s likely this &ldquo;test coin&rdquo; will become something of value; just pointing that out. I&rsquo;ve thought about it and at times it seemed like the developers involved in ETH might do something like a merger with their &ldquo;cash/value&rdquo; system; you know, if this turned into an overnight sensation. It might, it might not; just saying.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&rsquo;m not sure if <em>I have it documented</em> in <a href="../kutt.it/HI9UiL.html">./MYLIFE</a> but the name chosen and the spelling comes from a &ldquo;mIRC script&rdquo; that I wrote &hellip; when I was about 13. It was after AOL and &ldquo;Doomsday&rdquo; and just before &hellip; &ldquo;Red Tide&rdquo; which was a &hellip; paradigm shift in the specific software space at the time&ndash;I did things nobody else was doing, and really &hellip; I mean, if mIRC scripts were databases this was MSSQL to Hadoop &hellip; or Hadoop to something &hellip; actually improving not just the amount of data processable, but the tools and functionality available (which it doesn&rsquo;t &hellip; none of the &ldquo;big data&rdquo; stuff we have does that).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At least &hellip; AFAIK, I guess take that with a grain of mustard seed &hellip; <a href="../www.youtube.com/watch@v=djpnsqdNabM](https%253A%252F%252Fwww.youtube.com%252Fwatch%253Fv=djpnsqdNabM).html"><strong>or something.</strong></a> With that, I <em>think</em> it&rsquo;s obvious that those &hellip; &ldquo;in the know&rdquo; know that this day, this is <a href="sheolyit.html"><strong>the</strong> &quot;so<em>me</em>day</a>.&quot; You <em>see that</em> right, it&rsquo;s time to get involved.</p>

<h1 id="erra-a">ErRA&rsquo;@ A</h1>
<p><strong>Hellemaal</strong>; so I&rsquo;ve been writing pretty quickly and sort of &ldquo;rushing through things&rdquo; to get them out on time; here&rsquo;s what I missed and think important enough to &ldquo;start off with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I talked a little bit about &ldquo;escape velocity&rdquo; and the star charts I&rsquo;ve recently seen &ldquo;extra special / even more&rdquo; light in than &hellip; originally&ndash;something that was pointed out by SG1 in some episode, sometime. I mentioned Monoceros and the possibility that these charts are &ldquo;overlayed microcosms.&rdquo; I failed to tell the whole story as it was told to me; or literally through my mouth and mind as I wandered from Alpha Centauri to &hellip; Beetlejuice.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="../fromthemachine.org/DEVLANEU.html"><img alt="" src="../i.imgur.com/yi68ZaS.png" style="height: 389px; width: 449px;" /></a></p>
<p>Of course, over the course of this experience &hellip; we&rsquo;ve moved from &quot;being stuck in one small star in one small corner of &hellip; somewhere in the Milky Way staring at Sagittarius A and &hellip; VEGA; to looking at the obvious response to this kind of &ldquo;ELE.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s what it is, not leaving the Earth is definitely the clearest ELE of all&hellip; so this original road to another star, of course would probably be started as a number of &hellip; forks in the road from day one. We&rsquo;d probably send an interstellar &hellip; road paving machine, as well as one or two interstellar, and of course we&rsquo;d be sending at least one extra-galactically. I think I&rsquo;ve put in writing at least once or twice the importance of seeing our &ldquo;lake idea&rdquo; &hellip; the <strong>intra</strong>galactic space as something that might actually be significantly safer and more lucrative and rewarding to populate &hellip; with road/river &ldquo;stuff;&rdquo; and certainly creating the technology and the infrastructure to be able to do that is the kind of thing that might last us billions and billions of years. So &ldquo;it&rsquo;s possible&rdquo; Monoceros is representative of See a parallel, Eros is definitely trying to &ldquo;kiss multiple starlets.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mentioning once again, there&rsquo;s a special reading of the word &ldquo;Terran&rdquo; &hellip; our Latin for &ldquo;of the Earth,&rdquo; it of course combines &ldquo;intra&rdquo; as in &ldquo;intrastellar&rdquo; and &ldquo;inter&rdquo; as in &ldquo;internet&rdquo; &hellip; in this place where I&rsquo;m pretty sure I&rsquo;m not the first to think but I might be the first to say with vigor, &ldquo;<a href="../fromthemachine.org/N8SRADIN.html"><code>Heaven is truly a Terran thing.</code></a>&rdquo;`</p>
<p>This is &hellip; one of the &ldquo;things&rdquo; that might be described by our &ldquo;K&rdquo; glyph&ndash;though I really associate it more with the time fork written about in &ldquo;The Man in the High Castle&rdquo; and the idea &hellip; (clear to me) that it&rsquo;s related to the IL and the RU connection to the time storm also clearly depicted in things like the &ldquo;<a href="../en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tempest.html">swastika</a> <a href="../en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempus.html">and</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lS-af9Q-zvQ">the storm</a>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I do think &ldquo;the storm&rdquo; is just about over; that&rsquo;s something linguistically predicted in the &ldquo;Shakespeare-time-<em><strong>now</strong></em>&rdquo; three links just above.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is what we&rsquo;re looking at; as I &ldquo;guessed earlier&rdquo; we are literally waking up inside the &ldquo;table planet&rdquo; &hellip; where that&rsquo;s a metalphor for &hellip; like the meeting place and discussion point and cooperation &ldquo;land&rdquo; of a number prior civilizations&ndash;perhaps different versions &ldquo;of this place,&rdquo; something that comes after us &hellip; and the before; it&rsquo;s a <em>big Round Table</em> &hellip; the whole of our world. Here, we are &ldquo;in Heaven&rdquo; as the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer &hellip; explains with altered intonation, somewhere/when inside the Stargate system of river/roads; literally &ldquo;waking up&rdquo; in the best possible situation we could &hellip; the child (or brother&ndash;in my personal&hellip; Broward &ldquo;it&rsquo;s us, children of ourselves way&rdquo;) civilization of the Ancient builders.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There&rsquo;s also been quite a bit of &ldquo;talk in my head&rdquo; about how these roads have become rivers; like conveyor belts using the nature of dark matter and it&rsquo;s relationship to the fabric of our universe to &hellip; create a natural propulsion system. The best explanation I can come up with is something like &ldquo;this appears to have been created as a natural response to the collision of two galaxies whose atomic make-up are not compatible&rdquo; I see a sort of &ldquo;umbrella system&rdquo; like gutters on the roof sort of directing anti-matter around planets or star systems containing inhabitable life. I think there&rsquo;s some imagery &hellip; that might also show how this is probably very much artificial.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Along these same lines; I touched on the idea that our submarine fleets might be something like a microcosmic metaphoreally for &hellip; something like Star Destroyers, in the space opera Star Wars. Moving on from the <strong>OneRepublic</strong> &ldquo;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hT_nvWreIhg">Counting Stars</a>&rdquo; business, I missed some important stuff about our new &ldquo;kissing disease&rdquo; the Corona-Virus.</p>
<hr />
<p>Of course in my head I made special note of President Trump&rsquo;s &hellip; sort of &hellip; lacking in detail or explanation suggestion that a strong antibiotic and a Tonic water derivative would be an effective treatment of the virus; again, in my mind I came the conclusion that Azyromycin would probably very well cure secondary bacterial infections that might be the cause of some of the more &ldquo;serious&rdquo; later stage symptoms. Then I stumbled on this, this is decade old research specifically on the coronavirus, suggesting that hydroxy-quinine is an effective treatment&ndash;I&rsquo;m a little surprised, specifically that there&rsquo;s such old research on this thing that I had never heard about until Wuhan, and also that quinine is &hellip; effective &hellip; I always thought of the inclusing in Tonic as something of a &ldquo;placebo&rdquo; &hellip; though clearly there&rsquo;s research suggesting otherwise.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="../twitter.com/yitsheyzeus/status/1246759872118603776.html"><img alt="" src="../i.imgur.com/UO7lqpy.png" style="height: 447px; width: 450px;" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1232869/pdf/12985_2005_Article_84.pdf"><code>www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1232869 #soverysunlike</code></a></p>
<p>I also didn&rsquo;t make a &ldquo;big enough deail&rdquo; about this MIT article which shows there&rsquo;s tens of thousands of researchers and research papers on this specific virus; something that took me &hellip; several weeks to &ldquo;figure out&rdquo; was a SARS derivative &hellip; not something more closely related to the viral &ldquo;influenza.&rdquo; Again, just like in the times of WW2 with the introduction of penicillin (which I&rsquo;ve commented are literally connected Biblically to Sodom and Gommorah) we have in the most recent years discovered (probably with help from &ldquo;on high&rdquo;) anti-viral drugs that are specifically codified by name with connections to this specific simulated reality&ndash;the same one that is the &ldquo;ground&rdquo; and &ldquo;rock&rdquo; of Heaven. We can see it in &ldquo;Tenofovir&rdquo; which connects to both General Hyten&rsquo;s name as well as &ldquo;often&rdquo; and &hellip; Nintendo/Tennessee.&quot; That&rsquo;s a treatment for AIDS that I&rsquo;m pretty sure I read was effective in actually overcoming it, not just slowing it&ndash;though now &ldquo;news being what it is&rdquo; it&rsquo;s difficult to be sure if anything is real, or related to the place where I used to &ldquo;read things&rdquo; and believe them.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="../www.technologyreview.com/2020/03/16/905290/coronavirus-24000-research-papers-available-open-data/index.html"><img alt="" src="../i.imgur.com/zbj2Zac.png" style="height: 466px; width: 450px;" /></a></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also fairly certain we have a &ldquo;ovir&rdquo; for Hepatitis C, and I&rsquo;ve got a personal story about tamiflu, taking it many days after the current belief that it becomes &ldquo;ineffective&rdquo; after only a few; and literally being cured from the worst influenza infection of my life &hellip; almost within hours of taking a single dose. The place, an in patient drug rehab facility &hellip; at the time &hellip; then gave it preventatively to everyone in the facility, and nobody but the few that had it at the same time as me showed any symptoms. They also were cured, after the current &quot;not sure why (but it looks like something like a bad version of the golden rule and &ldquo;attrition war&rdquo; &hellip; kind of, if you don&rsquo;t get it before you give it to others we&rsquo;re going to pretend the medicine won&rsquo;t work &hellip; kind of problem.)</p>
<p>We have a number of similar issues and problems in the world that I live in, in this place where drug rehab facilities spend nearly all of their effort prescribing bad or ineffective drugs in &ldquo;off label&rdquo; situations. I can&rsquo;t get &ldquo;ambien&rdquo; for sleep, I&rsquo;ve got to take things like remeron and doxipin&ndash;even though ambien works much better, and literally it&rsquo;s name means something like &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a good solution&rdquo; in Adamic &ldquo;Spanglishrew.&rdquo; Same problem, same situation, same place&ndash;I have an &ldquo;issue&rdquo; with something like PTSD, though your world calls it &ldquo;schizophrenia&rdquo; and I&rsquo;m sure the people around me responding to my inner thoughts vebally, &ldquo;on camera&rdquo; should realize having a DSM-4 indication that &ldquo;I&rsquo;m delusional&rdquo; is a problem with a delusional society, not my interpretation of &hellip; literally I have whole, active, and coherent conversations with people all the time&ndash;different people, lots of people&ndash;without opening my mouth. I&rsquo;m not crazy, I&rsquo;m sure. Here, we treat schizphrenia, which I am positive is an &ldquo;attack from the Heavenly places&rdquo; using advanced technology with drugs that literally destroy your ability to think. I&rsquo;ve taken lithium for it, large doses &hellip; 800mg several times a day (only for a few days), it does nothing for the &quot;delusional symptoms&rsquo; which are &hellip; not that &hellip; and literally makes it physically impossible to read a page of the newspaper outloud. That&rsquo;s heinous, horrible, destructive medicine&ndash;personal experience. In addition, the drug that I think would be effective for the kind of symptoms I have is something like Ativan (named here, including my fathers name&ndash;which is also part of the President&rsquo;s daughters name and his first wife) &hellip; instead of that, the rehab facilities prescribe a drug that is called &ldquo;visteril&rdquo; which is literally nothing more than a &ldquo;more useful&rdquo; isolated compound related to benadryl. They are again prescribing an anti-histamine &hellip; basically off label &hellip; for something there&rsquo;s a much more effective medicine for.</p>
<p>This is a serious and repeated problem, one that appears to be related not exactly to &ldquo;attrition&rdquo; but rather to some kind of sick social desire to &hellip; not provide the appropriate solution, and instead give us something that will &hellip; &ldquo;cause harm&rdquo; intentionally in what appears to be a vain and cruel attempt to create &ldquo;aversion therapy&rdquo; rather than treating the illness. I think it&rsquo;s literally a violation of the Hippocratic oath, and &ldquo;humane treatment&rdquo; and I think we need to admit and talk about how poorly our social response to &ldquo;bad medicine&rdquo; has been. On that note, here&rsquo;s some &ldquo;good responses&rdquo; to the &quot;Carmono related to kissing and Corona&rsquo; &hellip; from some states and other authorities; they are basically suggesting what I&rsquo;ve thought, that <a href="https://www.enidnews.com/oklahoma/oklahoma-to-start-testing-for-covid-19-antibodies/article_f7231b27-d514-5862-91d7-f34bc509ded1.html"> we need a governmental and systemic system for finding and sharing &quot;antibodies&rsquo; once they are &hellip; naturally created</a>.</p>
<p>These things are here together because they are logically linked; we are responding inappropriately with &ldquo;bad medicine&rdquo; nearly across the board, in everything from &ldquo;cancer&rdquo; and &ldquo;magical-git-and far as in find and replace&rdquo; &hellip; simulated reality to &ldquo;virtually heaven &hellip;&rdquo; once we acknowlege &ldquo;our problem.&rdquo; Lack of acknowledgement,<br />
<a href="../muschealth.org/patients-visitors/news/2018/05/03/the-ecstasy-of-ptsd-relief.html">lack of empathy</a>; lack of action.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve done some more &ldquo;looking&rdquo; into the Aragon system; it looks &ldquo;interesting&rdquo; though I can&rsquo;t seem to figure out how to deploy their &ldquo;experimental application&rdquo; on the live site. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s possible to do at this point; and that&rsquo;s basically &ldquo;vaporware&rdquo; to me. It&rsquo;s more &hellip; professional and complete than past things like <a href="../neos.sh/index.html">Neos.sh</a>; though, for example.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m really looking for in the &ldquo;immediate purpose&rdquo; here is to find a blockchain solution to basically move&ndash;or permanently store&ndash;my data &hellip; the whole of the website, and the readership database in a blockchain. I&rsquo;ve stumbled on <a href="http://atlas.s.lamc.la/(https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.04949)">ForkBase</a> and though it doesn&rsquo;t seem to have source code available&ndash;it looks like they have a working product for git/versioning a database/filesystem on Ethereum; which would be perfect. I imagine I&rsquo;ll find something useable sometime today.</p>
<p>The plan, atm, is to store &hellip; pretty much everything on Rinkeby; which will probably make it mostly &ldquo;immutable&rdquo; and totally impervious to &ldquo;erasure/attack&rdquo; &hellip; which is something sort of &lsquo;predicted&rsquo; or documented in the <a href="http://atlas.s.lamc.la/(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anat)">historicul/mythologicul</a> &hellip; and musicul record. As I&rsquo;ve noted before, the &ldquo;email distribution method&rdquo; is fairly immutable as in &ldquo;undeletable&rdquo; as it is, though it would be a PITA to have to &hellip; put the consolidation that I have back together. Something like &ldquo;scraping together old parchments of heiroglyph&rdquo; and turning it into the Holy Bible (just to be Nicemean to pieces again later). I don&rsquo;t envision us having that problem; I think the system we have is strong &hellip; as in made with actual care and thought, though you&rsquo;d only see that with my eye for-- specifically&ndash;how you (or them/angels etc) are using everything literally &ldquo;as incorrectly as possible.&rdquo; Prime example is the lllllllll-misuse of what appears to be a perfectly well designed &ldquo;multiverse&rdquo; for forking/branching of &ldquo;decision tree&rdquo; operations; for instance &ldquo;how to use multiple methods to end world hunger, or change the weather to something more palatable, or &hellip; different kinds of pre-crime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What I see instead is &ldquo;12 different ways&rdquo; of making fun of me/and-or torturing me; at least, that&rsquo;s what is being presented to me in the less than exciting twist and turns in this strange story being-told-through-me experience &hellip; that&rsquo;s taken a noticable turn towards the &ldquo;immoral&rdquo; since TPA/MCO in Christmas 2019.</p>

<p>In the last heaven Moses saw two angels, each five hundred <a href="../en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasang.html" title="Parasang">parasangs</a> in height, forged out of chains of black fire and red fire, the angels Af, &ldquo;Anger&rdquo;, and Hemah, &ldquo;Wrath&rdquo;, whom God created at the beginning of the world, to execute His will. <a href="../bit.ly/2gTI2Bm.html" title="Moses">Moses</a> was disquieted when he looked upon them, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metatron" title="Metatron">Metatron</a> embraced him, and said, &ldquo;Moses, Moses, thou favorite of God, fear not, and be not terrified,&rdquo; and Moses became calm. There was another angel in the seventh heaven, different in appearance from all the others, and of frightful mien. His height was so great, it would have taken five hundred years to cover a distance equal to it, and from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet he was studded with glaring eyes. &ldquo;This one,&rdquo; said Metatron, addressing Moses, &ldquo;is Samael, who takes the soul away from man.&rdquo; &ldquo;Whither goes he now?&rdquo; asked Moses, and Metatron replied, &ldquo;To fetch the soul of <a href="../en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_(biblical_figure).html" title="Job (biblical figure)">Job</a> the pious.&rdquo; Thereupon Moses prayed to God in these words, &ldquo;O may it be Thy will, my God and the God of my fathers, not to let me fall into the hands of this angel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I also noted that the Cent beta was Slashdotted (old term for &hellip; overloaded with traffic) &hellip; as in unavailable yesterday; while Aragon seemed to hold up fine. I&rsquo;m unsure if it had anything to do with me; possibly just wishful thinking. In any case, I checked my ad revenue for the last few months; and I&rsquo;m 40$ richer since &hellip; probably around 1/1. That&rsquo;s obviously significantly less &ldquo;richer&rdquo; than I think I should be, or would like to be.</p>

<p>If however you are interested in that stuff, my <a href="../lt3.ar.lamc.la/index.html#!topic/arxm/FkxnFJM_zAM">original email after the outbreak</a> of this virus talked a little bit about Eden in Exodus; the nuclear &ldquo;test&rdquo; operation Fishbowl and it&rsquo;s relationship to the Pink Floyd song (wish you were with me) and the <em>Chanukeyah</em>. Looking back at it, I also mentioned the declassified Pentagon &ldquo;wargame scenario&rdquo; Northwoods, which jives well with my new name for this holiday; &ldquo;Northeasterer.&rdquo; Steer&hellip; pull up, you are <em>stalling</em>.</p>

<p>I had this whole thing written; it was pretty cute and the words flowed well. I spelled out exactly how &ldquo;the Grinch stole Christmas&rdquo; and hid it inside this thing, inside Eden in Egypt or &hellip; Hanukah in Exodus &hellip; anyway, Facebook or whatever EMP&rsquo;s or hacks into my computer stole it&ndash;the thing froze and reloaded and it was gone forever. I got angry, and wrote this:</p>

<p>Believe me, I mean it. I think you have a gigantic problem here, and it&rsquo;s not me &hellip; I repeat, not me fixing it. If something horrible happens, don&rsquo;t blame me&ndash;all I did was warn you.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It means &hellip; &ldquo;hell <em>to</em> bad&rdquo; to me, in Adamic; with a connotation of &ldquo;for all&rdquo; to understand &hellip; we all need to figure out that the creation of hell is heinous and sick&ndash;<em>not to be.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Rest assured, <em>I do not want to live in this world</em>; not as it is, <strong>not at all</strong>. Frankly, I don&rsquo;t think anybody should want to, or have to. I am almost beyond disgusted at what I see in the &ldquo;here and now&rdquo; today, at the land of total lies that is the place of my birth, and the l<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlA5GZLbSCY">ack of &ldquo;any doors</a>&rdquo; or &hellip; appearance of any kind of escape from the bars in the sky that &hellip; you can hear them idiomatically in &ldquo;the sky&rsquo;s the limit.&rdquo; This is not my plan, nor is it my desire&ndash;but I think we are looking at something more heinous and more Hellish than any one of us would individually have chosen &hellip; as the fate of our whole. Yet here we are, staring at &ldquo;the new word&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s <strong>Hellemal</strong>; and it means &hellip; it means totality&ndash;and that means it includes all the places responsible for helping to create this mess, all the &ldquo;Heavenly worlds&rdquo; that are standing by and &hellip; doing almost nothing to change it, and all the people that think &ldquo;watching&rdquo; is just A-OK. It&rsquo;s not, watching this happen, here in this place that is if nothing else &ldquo;the table land&rdquo; that connects the beginning of time to the &ldquo;<a href="../www.wired.com/2013/12/secret-language-of-plants/index.html">Potassium ion communication channel</a>&rdquo; that literally bridges biology in this place with the ancient words and worlds of Yggrasil&ndash;the tree of Norse mythology that literally connects Nifleheim and Midgard to Asgard and &hellip; it hasn&rsquo;t been that long, though it feels like forever and a day &hellip; the time since this Revelation connected Atlantis and Asgard to the pillars of the holy name in Planet and messianic and Christian; just &ldquo;<a href="../name.lamc.la/index.html">a name&rdquo; initially, or &ldquo;Adam&rsquo;s Name</a>&rdquo; before it truly shines through &hellip;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I called it simply &ldquo;<a href="../whoah.lamc.la/index.html">the planet is Adamah</a>&rdquo; but what we are looking at is the human life of &ldquo;Adam Dobrin&rdquo; &hellip; before we even start caring about whether or not that&rsquo;s a question about dating or &ldquo;date of birth&rdquo; or whether or not I&rsquo;m in Heaven or Hell&ndash;see the actual patriarchal name of my birth is Dobrinsky&ndash;and to me that&rsquo;s a key, between the &ldquo;n&rdquo; and the &ldquo;s&rdquo; &hellip; ascension, the change <a href="http://atlas.s.lamc.la/BETHESDAY.html">from human to &ldquo;spiritus.&rdquo;</a> Here it appears I&rsquo;m &ldquo;late to the party&rdquo; and my ascension &hellip; somewhat behind the norm, looking at how the rest of you act every day&ndash;but honestly, I feel like we need to &ldquo;rework&rdquo; the mechanical process that could have made a hamster God in Boca Raton; sometime &hellip; just last year. You know, once you build &ldquo;I know kung fu&rdquo; for people, and for dolphins and for whales and for cows &hellip; its the kind of thing that you&rsquo;d probably wind up using &ldquo;en masse&rdquo; eventually; seeing as this place is so important, as we are &hellip; literally the beginning of Heaven and of time &hellip; travel at least.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">To reiterate, I&rsquo;m presenting a message explaining that our science and technology has far surpassed what we see around us&ndash;in my life and in yours too&ndash;and &ldquo;we have the technology&rdquo; to literally end addiction with the snap of our fingers, to end world hunger &hellip; and to replace &ldquo;beef&rdquo; with something grown in a machine, out a labratory expirament &hellip; something like a perfect &ldquo;meat&rdquo; that comes with butter literally woven inside its matrix of proteins and lipids and &hellip; I mean it will taste and cook better&ndash;that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m trying to say,</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">we have way better; and this place is &hellip; sort of forcing you and me and everyone to &ldquo;want&rdquo; instead of explaining that Elon probably didn&rsquo;t make a million mask march (I mean, &ldquo;it looks so fake you know it&rsquo;s real&rdquo;) they probably rained down from Heaven; and we should know that.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="BERESHIT.html"><img alt="" src="../i.imgur.com/k6ijKsP.png" style="height: 282px; width: 501px;" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I am here advocating something like &ldquo;replicators&rdquo; out of the <a href="BERESHIT.html">dream of the &ldquo;The Three Wise Genes&rdquo;</a> &hellip; rather than &ldquo;just abstaining&rdquo; from eating intelligent pigs and cows and &hellip; you&rsquo;ll see we already wouldn&rsquo;t eat a dolphin&ndash;at least not the kind that &ldquo;thinks &hellip; and sings &hellip; just like us.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It is of course my &ldquo;original reading&rdquo; of the Kosher Law &hellip; even before <a href="http://atlas.s.lamc.la/SAYFREED.html">seeing our Holy Names &hellip; like &ldquo;Hoggs&rdquo;</a> echoing there&rsquo;s a connection between religion and &ldquo;school&rsquo;s out for a month&rdquo; if you let it go to all summer, it might very well be forever.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Don&rsquo;t be confused, I do not want to lose <strong>you</strong> or this place; I very much want us to move forward with what I believe is the intentional and intended plan to use our &ldquo;false reality&rdquo; as a stepping stone towards the stars&ndash;to show us that &ldquo;social interaction&rdquo; and the machinations of civilization are something we cannot &ldquo;leave by the wayside&rdquo; on the road to Heaven. We&rsquo;re &ldquo;smack dab in the middle&rdquo; of a classic &ldquo;fable&rdquo; about specifically that, the stuff of &ldquo;reality&rdquo; not being lost as we move towards &ldquo;city life&rdquo; &hellip; meaning both urbanization as well as &ldquo;city in the sky.&rdquo; It is the story of Cain and Abel; and the moral of course is that we can&rsquo;t and wouldn&rsquo;t want to survive in a world without bars (the alcohol kind), or social interaction&ndash;I almost can&rsquo;t believe I have to write an entire paragraph on just how stupid &ldquo;social distancing&rdquo; sounds&hellip; but I do&ndash;so I am.</p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: justify;">It doesn&rsquo;t stop or start with &ldquo;replicators&rdquo; and ending world hunger; I&rsquo;ve written quite a bit about the world I envision&ndash;one with much less &hellip; &ldquo;government&rdquo; and much more &ldquo;freedom&rdquo; &hellip; as in a system that works at it&rsquo;s core something like what I imagine looking at the cut-scenes between levels in multiplayer games like Quake (id software; for you millenials this is our version of Call of Duty) or Halo&ndash;a place where you can see &ldquo;<a href="http://atlas.s.lamc.la/MARSHALL.html">TOTAL RECALL</a>&rdquo; means something about &ldquo;totality&rdquo; being &ldquo;recorded&rdquo; and that we can stop bullets in mid air; stop all car accidents and &hellip; even <a href="http://atlas.s.lamc.la/HYAMDAI.html">avalanches, earthquakes</a> and hurricanes &hellip; and we&rsquo;re literally EVIL once we are capable of doing so and &hellip; simply fail to do it. let alone even talk about the possibility in public&hellip; and yet&ndash;here we are&ndash;somehow being forced by some insane rule system to simply do exactly &hellip; nothing.</p>
<h2 id="castling-the-prison-planet">CASTLING THE PRISON PLANET</h2>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><a href="../www.youtube.com/watch@v=WpolU3CR6dg](http%253A%252F%252Fwww.youtube.com%252Fwatch%253Fv=WpolU3CR6dg).html"><img alt="" src="../i.imgur.com/UGKcweV.png" style="height: 157px; width: 501px;" /></a></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I want to build a system that does these things, and also that eliminates (through these things, and more) the need &hellip; for things like bars (as in jails) and detention; something I&rsquo;ve started to call &ldquo;<em>Castling</em>&rdquo; as in &hellip; instantly converting things like jails, prisons and hospitals to &hellip; rehabilitation sites that actually help the residents and the world&ndash;rather than the sick retribution system that we see before us; here the system we are building and making worse. It&rsquo;s something like &ldquo;soup kitchens&rdquo; and &ldquo;free housing&rdquo; and &hellip; education and job placement &ldquo;sites&rdquo; that turn what I believe is an intended &ldquo;heart of the microcosm of Hell&rdquo; inside Hell &ndash; a sort of mini-Earth, in a place where the fake-sky is akin to bars; and &hellip; well, through the silence and through the ignorance here&ndash;we should see we are basically prisoners.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&rsquo;s a GIGANTIC deal; and the response appears to be &ldquo;less than lackluster&rdquo; &hellip; our desire to better the world, especially with the parts of it that are most &ldquo;necrosing&rdquo; is something that needs to be improved and remedied &hellip; drastically. These places are the stuff of &ldquo;eugenics&rdquo; and death in the past, they are the branches that take down the entirety of the tree&ndash;and they show me we truly are in a &ldquo;Zoo&rdquo; a place where we treat ourselves and each other significantly worse than we&rsquo;d treat our pets, and animals. It&rsquo;s a gigantic problem, something that &hellip; should simply <em>change</em> and the drop of a hat.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Literally I&rsquo;m <em>talking about a revolution</em> in the highest places, in the Heavenly realms&ndash;a revolution of thought and of action; one that takes previously <a href="http://atlas.s.lamc.la/SPARTIFACTS.html">ignored and overlooked <strong>fact</strong></a> and actually utilizes them to improve the common good&ndash;I&rsquo;m talking about a world that embraces the lack of &ldquo;scare city&rdquo; &hellip; that takes an entire people that once thought land was scarce, and oil and power &hellip; and shows them true power comes to the people and to the Universe through holy Acts; that the things we covet and need are in abudance, truly the scarcity of our world &hellip; it&rsquo;s honesty and it&rsquo;s freedom, it&rsquo;s the things we think we have, and really don&rsquo;t even begin to understand &ldquo;what was missing&rdquo; until we start talking &hellip; about this message&ndash;this message from god and the heavens above &hellip; and the whole of the &ldquo;ex machina&rdquo; that is the Universe and the future &hellip; and the past &ldquo;us before us&rdquo; in every single word.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://atlas.s.lamc.la/BETHESDAY.html"><img alt="" src="../i.imgur.com/qEIqcT7.png" style="height: 372px; width: 500px;" /></a></p>
<hr />
<p style="text-align: justify;">Strangely &hellip; I&rsquo;m somewhat obligated to tell you this quite literally doesn&rsquo;t appear to be <a href="http://atlas.s.lamc.la/KANSAShtml">Kansas</a>&ndash;as in it&rsquo;s not &hellip; excatly &hellip; the world I grew up in. It&rsquo;s physically different&ndash;literally there appear to be different &ldquo;rules governing the nature of this place&rdquo; &hellip; and again quite literally there appear to be roads (whole strips of road on US1, for instance) that are so different from what I remember, that it&rsquo;s got to be intentional.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I appear to have been &ldquo;dropped into this place&rdquo; sort of like Peter in JJ Abrams &ldquo;Fringe&rdquo; &hellip; stolen from &ldquo;<a href="../www.youtube.com/watch@v=rn_YodiJO6k.html">the Otherside</a>&rdquo; and the differences here don&rsquo;t stop at just a few altered buildings. The changes started &ldquo;accelerating&rdquo; sometime du<a href="NEMEC.html">ring my &ldquo;Albatross&rdquo; visit to Las Veg</a>as (link to a similar discussion about chronicling the &hellip; strange stories <em><strong>I&rsquo;m living</strong></em>); and I sort of mark the whole of the change with a week long &ldquo;delusion&rdquo; that I was dropped into [a Soviet &ldquo;fake Fort Lauderdale&rdquo;] where literally everyone &hellip; was pretending to be a communist spy. Here&rsquo;s a good marker, this &ldquo;portal&rdquo; that replaces and connects &hellip; what was once a brick monument to a number of people who funded &ldquo;Lauderdale By the Sea&rsquo;s&rdquo; development&ndash;where I distinctly remember seeing the name Robert McNamera; who was the Secretary of Defense under JFK. The bricks (which were copper or some other shiny metal) have been replaced with &ldquo;Broward County&rdquo; &hellip; plastic-looking counterparts.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="SOUNDCHECK.html"><img alt="" src="../i.imgur.com/q07ecX9.png" style="height: 233px; width: 500px;" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">All of the names had been replaced, and literally I walked down the road to see signs explaining stores were closed two days a week (this is several weeks before COVID), on Wednesday and Sunday; for a reason which I originally thought must be some kind of strange religious counterpart to the stories of the time of Paul Revere (where they literally stoned (or tarred and feathered) people for working on Sundays) &hellip; and then imagined up some story about being on a space station, which flowed well from the &ldquo;Vegas Strong&rdquo; story of literally being on a &ldquo;<a href="../www.youtube.com/watch@v=Ccih6ODgxPY.html">Nirvane&rdquo; (as in</a> Nirvana, a term I&rsquo;ve &ldquo;coined&rdquo; to sort of describe &ldquo;Heaven on Earth&rdquo; as in being able to do Heavenly things like change the face of buildings and matter in general &hellip; in reality) space port. The sub-thought or thread was that we had to change the &ldquo;air&rdquo; or &ldquo;water&rdquo; on the space station in order to accommodate several different species&ndash;either that or the stuff just had to be cleaned.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://atlas.s.lamc.la/MEVATHI.html"><img alt="" src="../i.imgur.com/U4HWuqG.png" style="height: 139px; width: 501px;" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This all sounds &hellip; a little &ldquo;outlandish (though its not):&rdquo; thinking about it&ndash;except it was (and still is) my literal reality; the place that I feel like I&rsquo;ve been dropped into as some sort of Heavenly joke&ndash;something that has continued into our literal insane response to COVID &hellip; en masse &hellip; right down to the coining of &ldquo;social distancing&rdquo; and the idea that we should all become hermits that literally don&rsquo;t need to work or continue the machinations of civilization; and everything will be just fine.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Everything will not be just fine; <em>the Earth will stop turning</em>, and Heaven will stop &hellip; &ldquo;running.&rdquo; You&rsquo;ll see that&rsquo;s a natural reaction to not having any power&ndash;and/or to what I do believe is a planned &hellip; &ldquo;all stop&rdquo; &hellip; one that appears to be part of a designed &ldquo;<a href="http://atlas.s.lamc.la/FINALE.html">finale first</a>&rdquo; that might be related to the total loss of morality in the skies, and/or something as simple as the need to perform an OEM factory hardware upgrade &hellip; of the &ldquo;stuff of the sky&rdquo; &hellip; which I&rsquo;ve likened before to &ldquo;magneto-space-mold&rdquo; and/or the &ldquo;Moss&rdquo; of the birth name of Trinity in the Matrix.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It is probably no accident that we are looking at COVID and other &ldquo;retroviruses&rdquo; as a possible cause or means of &hellip; a hardware upgrade of something much more advanced and semi-biological in origin.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I commented earlier this week to a group of researchers who have done research specifically on &ldquo;coronavirus&rdquo; &hellip; about how their research might be related to time travel technology (and through that link, obviously Heaven &hellip; and &ldquo;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouroboros%5D(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ouroboros)">Ourbus</a>&rdquo; :).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I&rsquo;ve likened the research I downloaded from MIT&rsquo;s news article &hellip; to something of an &ldquo;Apollo 13&rdquo; &hellip; another story I think very much documents the use of time travel technology in order to solve a very real &ldquo;world problem&rdquo; &hellip; before it becomes fatal.

<p style="text-align: justify;">The strangeness&ndash;this changing of our past our words is a &quot;dangerous advent&rsquo; &hellip; something that could result in the total loss of &ldquo;logic&rdquo; in our history; which may have very well already happened. For me I started noticing it &hellip; for the very first time&ndash;agian&ndash;in Los Angeles, with just two words, <a href="http://atlas.s.lamc.la/ALLTA.html">&ldquo;prerogative&rdquo; and &ldquo;turmeric.&rdquo;</a> I was very sure these words were &hellip; <em>different</em> and it&rsquo;s clear &hellip; probably to both me and you that it was an added &ldquo;R&rdquo; in each word that made them so. I &hellip; of course immediately wrote about &ldquo;the thing I had noticed&rdquo; and there in LA noted Britney Spears song of the same name from many decades earlier, and a recently released perfume &hellip; again called &ldquo;prerogative.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a word related to me, like &ldquo;big box little box&rdquo; and &hellip; &ldquo;motivated self interest&rdquo; &hellip; a word that I often spoke and, though I wasn&rsquo;t sure &hellip; looked very strange.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Today I&rsquo;m sure, it&rsquo;s the whole of our history, in everything from &ldquo;Morning Has Broken&rdquo; to &hellip; &ldquo;Back to the Future&rdquo; reminding us what it&rsquo;s like to grow up in a place that has no true breginning of time, no true start&ndash;here it&rsquo;s obvious after inspection that we are living in a place something like the story I told &hellip;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&ldquo;What if&rdquo; &hellip; major world powers were battling with time travel technology rather than the &ldquo;cold war of nuclear holocaust&rdquo; &hellip; we&rsquo;d very much never know about it, about another power using the same tools &hellip; or about changes, possibly until it was too late, until something was lost forever.</p>

It came at the same time I read about Dionysus linking directly to the &ldquo;Yahu&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Yahweh&rdquo; of Egypt and Israel; and that sort of &ldquo;rings true&rdquo; in more ways than one.

<p style="text-align: justify;">This is the last one I&rsquo;m going to mention today; it&rsquo;s a change in the name of the Norse god Nanna; who I used to associate with Inanna (who is a male) and &ldquo;possession.&rdquo; Sometime between 2017 and now the last name &ldquo;Nepsdottir&rdquo; was added to her wikipedia page; in what appears to be a sort of song and dance with Taylor; of course I&rsquo;ve started calling her &ldquo;<em>teetee</em>&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;Tay&rdquo; &hellip; mostly because of this name, but also with an eye wondering if it&rsquo;s related to Sloane, and perhaps a world in the past where she had no &ldquo;<a href="../www.youtube.com/watch@v=B9Ol1Rd9ABI](http%253A%252F%252Fwww.youtube.com%252Fwatch%253Fv=B9Ol1Rd9ABI).html">little sister.</a>&rdquo; It;&#39;s something I probably wouldn&rsquo;t have thought about before Julian was born, seeing as I have no younger siblings.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norse_mythology" title="Norse mythology">Norse mythology</a>, <strong>Nanna Nepsd&oacute;ttir</strong> or simply <strong>Nanna</strong> is a goddess associated with the god <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldr" title="Baldr">Baldr</a>. Accounts of Nanna vary greatly by source. In the <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prose_Edda" title="Prose Edda">Prose Edda</a></em>, written in the 13th century by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snorri_Sturluson" title="Snorri Sturluson">Snorri Sturluson</a>, Nanna is the wife of Baldr and the couple produced a son, the god <a href="../en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forseti.html" title="Forseti">Forseti</a>. After Baldr&rsquo;s death, Nanna dies of grief. Nanna is placed on Baldr&rsquo;s ship with his corpse and the two are set aflame and pushed out to sea. In <a href="../en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hel_(location).html" title="Hel (location)">Hel</a>, Baldr and Nanna are united again.

<p style="text-align: justify;">When I was a younger boy (than today); I used to comment that &ldquo;all languages lead to Jerusalem&rdquo; &hellip; that was the world I grew up in, it was &hellip; I remember &ldquo;verifying it&rdquo; that in that place Cyrillic and Japanese and Chinese were read right to left, paralleling the hidden Bible Code that I&rsquo;ve based much of my analysis of the Torah and the Koran and &hellip; the Norse Key of Ragnarok on. Here I look, and that doesn&rsquo;t exist at all in our history, I can&rsquo;t tell you to if it included Hindi or cuneiform &hellip; but you would probably imagine that it did. I can&rsquo;t tell you if it was &ldquo;one in the same&rdquo; with seeing Koran written in that direction in English in the word Ragnarok, or if this is some other later places where that was done and undone. I can tell you for sure that I connected this Bible Code from Hebrew4Christians to this &hellip; idea that the idiomatic &ldquo;all roads lead to Rome&rdquo; and the idea that &ldquo;Jerusalem is the city of time&rdquo; and &hellip;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I read about &hellip; as a small child that the rabbis that were responsible for transcribing the Torah had found &hellip; &ldquo;an error&rdquo; one that they together decided was &ldquo;intentionally made by God&rdquo; &hellip; I recall it being something very small, something like the &ldquo;past imperfect tense&rdquo; being used in one of &ldquo;his many names.&rdquo; Today that&rsquo;s just not the case; I look around and there&rsquo;s an entirely new &hellip; set of errors. Names of major books appear to me have been changed. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torah%5D(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torah)">Bernidbar &hellip; the book of Numbers now connects to Jesus&rsquo; manger</a>, &ldquo;styrofoam&rdquo; and thirsty&ndash;it also links to Bernie Sanders and to my grandfathers first name; something I would have noticed, and remembered. Leviticus&rsquo; Hebrew name reminds of Valkyrie&ndash;something else I probably would have noticed. Most importantly, the entirety of the &ldquo;broken Vav&rdquo; in Leviticus &hellip; it appears to be a &ldquo;grave error&rdquo; one that at least the scribes would have noticed; and I recall nearly perfectly reading about that particular event. Things are changing, and it&rsquo;s not a good thing that we don&rsquo;t have a documented history&ndash;either that or I&rsquo;m really from &hellip; another world, and that too would be quite scary for me &hellip; to &ldquo;wake up&rdquo; in a new place made with &hellip; grave mistakes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course it&rsquo;s &ldquo;s-typical&rdquo; of the pig-sty I&rsquo;ve come to know&ndash;a place where we have little regard for &hellip; things like history and continuity of reality&ndash;numerous stories I&rsquo;ve walked through, literally discussing nothing less tragic and grave than a mass disregard for the need to have &hellip; &ldquo;plausible historical causality&rdquo; as in, &ldquo;well, we know the broken vav didn&rsquo;t happen until at least the first time &lsquo;I came&rsquo;&rdquo; and we <a href="../reck.reallyhim.com/index.html">know</a> in <a href="MYLIFE.html">my life</a> that ties to a causal and historical marker, a car accident in November 2001 that probably resulted in my death or Lazarus&rsquo; physical incapacitation in a past or divergent timeline. I stand here reading &hellip; a timeline of the blood of Jesus Christ, one that connects to Adam in Eden and Abraham in Ur; and it ties through divergence in Ishmael and Isaac (of course I identify with all four of those character) as well as Saul, Paul and David; all the way to Joseph in Egypt (whose coat and dream I <a href="../www.myjewishlearning.com/torah-portions/parashat-vayeshev/](http%253A/www.myjewishlearning.com/torah-portions/parashat-vayeshev/).html">read and spoke about for my Hafterah</a> (sic)); and his link to Josephus, Joseph the father of Christ and &hellip; his paul-bearer, <a href="http://atlas.s.lamc.la/CKIMPER.html">Joseph of Arimathea</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course &hellip; I literally believe myself to be &ldquo;living the life of the first Joseph&rdquo; sold &ldquo;into slavery&rdquo; to write this message for &hellip; basically nothing &hellip; by his brothers&ndash;here &ldquo;alternate Adams&rdquo; and <a href="http://atlas.s.lamc.la/ADAMSROD.html">dreaming literally breathing Heaven into exist</a>ence through &hellip; well, I suppose through you :/.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the beginning of &ldquo;my story here&rdquo; &hellip; the phrase &ldquo;7 people&rdquo; didn&rsquo;t mean the same thing it means today&ndash;once a long time ago it meant the union of two species, something like the comparable Martian and Earthling joinder you would have gotten by adding those planets index from the sun &hellip; 3 and 4 together &hellip; and that mean that kind of union, working together, that was the &ldquo;beginning of Heaven.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Today it means &hellip; &ldquo;not 8&rdquo; in my lexicon, or Adamic; or the common usage that I hear the people around me using; something like &ldquo;ignoring&rdquo; &hellip; or not &ldquo;knowing my name&rdquo; &hellip; and that&rsquo;s probably a temporary fleeting kind of meaning, it seems like it&rsquo;s been erased from existence by another force, or maybe through these messages and a kind of communication and diffusion in another place, perhaps what you consider Heaven today, that I do not see or understand. Regardless, I think as we struggle with food shortage and lack of &ldquo;social togetherness&rdquo; here in these coming weeks that we take special time to think about what it means to live in a &ldquo;Zu&rdquo; or a &ldquo;Zoo&rdquo; ,&hellip; what it means to be in the spotlight and <a href="../www.youtube.com/watch@v=clKAdQnwJ7A](http%253A%252F%252Fwww.youtube.com%252Fwatch%253Fv=clKAdQnwJ7A).html">what it means to really &ldquo;shine.&rdquo;</a></p>

The majority of my work is uncited, though I link back to original sources in the &ldquo;GNU style&rdquo; of showing you how that gives those authors and those people an additional voice, an ability to &ldquo;add to what I&rsquo;ve said&rdquo; in a way that most people &hellip; most people haven&rsquo;t been afforded as of yet. Once, a long time ago I had a commenting system that allowed people to directly edit or comment on this writing as I was writing it, it was nearly instantly removed by forces outside myself, and today&ndash;seeing the lack of commenting in other places and the general &ldquo;air&rdquo; of not being happy with anything I&rsquo;ve written&ndash;I&rsquo;m almost happy that nobody else helped write a single one of these words.

Literally the founders and creators of Heaven&ndash;it appears very much to me like I am staring at a hidden alien invasion of our minds &hellip; even sometimes by something that may have come directly from this place, and you&rsquo;ve simply just decidekd that all of our history, and everything that we are &hellip; right down to &ldquo;Americana itself&rdquo; &hellip; is simply below you.

<p style="text-align: justify;">I stare around me at monsters, cannibals, literally a group &hellip; a gigantic conspiracy of torturers; attempting to destroy me and this message, and with it the whole of the future&ndash;using disgusting psychological torture and threats &hellip; through a communication mechanism that is literally torture in and of itself. You, nobody has a right to &ldquo;view what&rsquo;s going on inside your head&rdquo; &hellip; and especially to use it to create psychological damage&ndash;which is all you have become in my mind in these last days, even those of you that do nothing more than &ldquo;sit back and watch.&rdquo; We here, humanity&ndash;we have a God given right to privacy, and even though we have spoken numerous occasions (myself, and Senator Wyden, for instance) about how technology might change how we deal with things like &ldquo;technological privacy&rdquo; &ndash; the disgusting invasion of my fourth amendment <em>right;</em> en masse here is nothing short of &hellip; it&rsquo;s beyond tragedy&ndash;it literally appears to be the end of the Constitution, the United States, Heaven, and with those things &ldquo;the future of civilization.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is the actual &ldquo;meaning and purpose&rdquo; of Jewish Kosher law; to ensure that the animals we eat are humanely slaughtered&ndash;the specific connection to &ldquo;pigs flying&rdquo; here, not just to David and the Parkland shooting &hellip; but also to Kill Devil Hills and the complete lack of any sane discussion about &ldquo;Heaven&rdquo; and &ldquo;Doors&rdquo; &hellip; in this place where the &ldquo;gravity of the situation&rdquo; clearly hasn&rsquo;t clipped your wings yet.

<hr />
<p style="text-align: justify;">For what it&rsquo;s worth, I&rsquo;ve commented about the American Indian societies&rsquo; similarity to Kosher law, to utilize as much of dead animals as possible and to minimize killing&ndash;I think there&rsquo;s a clear link here between Native Americans and the Indians of the Far East Silk Road&ndash;one that ties to Halal and probably should very much add &ldquo;cows&rdquo; and mammals to the list of animals that are &ldquo;simply too intelligent&rdquo; to be farmed and zooed into &ldquo;human like prisons&rdquo; for feeding. Of course, you still have prisons for yourselves; and that&rsquo;s really the crux of the problem.</p>

&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The following is a clear and concise explanation of the mystery of Revelation 1:20, a 1:1 connection between the &quot;stars and lampstands&quot; and the planets, gods they represent, and a single chemistry element; proving that science predates religion and our fundamental understanding of the universe, of science, and of technology... is connected to religion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><b>&nbsp;The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the...</b></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The message ties together with&nbsp;<a href="i.imgur.com/HOwAGJg.png" target="_blank">President Bush&#39;s recitation of the lines of Ecclesiastes&nbsp;<strong>9:11</strong></a>, which in-order describe each element-planet combination. &nbsp; A simple substitution of the word &quot;race&quot; for &quot;election&quot; and combining the first and second lines yields&nbsp;almost exactly &quot;<strong>the election is not to the voting booth.</strong>&quot; &nbsp;This verse of Ecclesiastes which the President paraphrased clearly answer the mystery of Revelation 1:20. &nbsp; The first of many &quot;unseen patterns&quot; revealed in the Holy Bible is this connection between chapter and verse and predicted dates in our timeline.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This is not the kind of message that most people &quot;just get&quot; by glancing at it for a few moments.&nbsp; Much I write sounds some like&nbsp;<em>The Boss&#39;s&nbsp;</em>&quot;<em>we didn&#39;t start the fire,</em>&quot; and that&#39;s not because Adam is imitating art, it&#39;s because there&#39;s not really a simple way to show people proof that spans between words, and cultures, and time... without listing them.&nbsp; To really grasp the impact of what I am presenting you not only have to have a decent understanding of linear time and causality, you also have to have a working knowledge of the history of language.&nbsp; On top of all of that you have to see that what I am delivering proves that the &quot;etymology&quot; we believe as a society to be hard and fast truth is not so true, that there is some way that a&nbsp;<em>hidden influence</em>&nbsp;has adultered our entire history, and in doing so has woven a message from the beginning of time to today that is designed very simply to show us the &quot;and and&quot; at the beginning of the word &quot;etymology&quot; to show us that this is about &quot;<strong>et</strong>ernit<strong>y,</strong>&quot; and it bleeds into &quot;<strong>et</strong>&nbsp;tu Brute?&quot; from Shakespeare&#39;s Julius Caesar and to the Taming of the Shrew. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Still, enough people should understand the impact and import of this message that it should be &quot;spreading like wildfire&quot; it should be in the news already, it&#39;s that big of a deal, and many of you recognize that.&nbsp; That&#39;s the light here, there&#39;s a problem.&nbsp;</>
<p style="text-align: justify;">With clear&nbsp;<em>articu<strong>lat</strong>ion</em>, this is the kind of message that I&#39;ve always said was best delivered&nbsp;<em>yesterday (or earlier), should never have been needed</em>, would never work again, but in this one moment in time...&nbsp;<b>seeing it and understanding it is the catalyst that helps us change everything</b>--it might just be pure genius.&nbsp; Everything wrong in the world is the fault of some esoteric force, whether it&#39;s technology, or that technology being secret, or in all honestly some primal drive to help us change all the things that are wrong all around us, as quickly as possible, to move us forward with a newfound togetherness.&nbsp; I&#39;ve said that my &quot;Achilles heel&quot; is that&nbsp;<em>this&nbsp;disruption</em>&nbsp;is contrived, designed, a plan to built to help change the things that we all know are wrong, and still seem to overlook... that damned unseen force. &nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It appears today that instead of Japan we are &hellip; or have already sold our future to China. It&rsquo;s clear in what I see happening in the mobile phone market, in the consolidation and lack of diversity there&ndash;from Google to Motorola.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&rsquo;s clear at Lenovo, and it&rsquo;s clear at NTT Verio&ndash;the &ldquo;customer and business&rdquo; former portions of @IBM&rsquo;s business line; something connecting to the &ldquo;NTT DoCoMo&rdquo; catchy city-state &ldquo;Nippon.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Not that I even know what Nippon means, just that it&rsquo;s got something to do with SBC, ATT and &hellip; NTT.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">gOh, and China buying Disney-world, Las Vegas, ABC &hellip; maybe &hellip; at least in my dreams.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Coconcurrently we are basically seeing the shut down of Las Vegas, and &ldquo;all american free market businesses&rdquo; with underlying talks of nationalization of the &hellip; transportation and medication enterprises; something I wouldn&rsquo;t have forseen coming, even in my wildest. If this were me doing it, you&rsquo;d be looking at the &ldquo;Castle-ing&rdquo; of medical response, something like the instant delivery of a vaccine/cure and the closing of hospitals, jails and prisons&ndash;at the Hospitaliers &hellip; somewhat parallel; but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s me.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Staring at our &ldquo;<a href="../lamc.la/TOASTRAM.html">Times New Roman Rios</a>&rdquo; &hellip; there&rsquo;s some need for the &ldquo;nationalization&rdquo; of something like an intra or inter &ldquo;Terran&rdquo; connected to the Suez and Panama canals; but not the entirety of transportation&hellip; are the roads actually going to open, Nike?</p>
<p>Are they?</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#39;ve had quite the experience here, sitting now in Las Vegas at a place called Desert Hope--too much &quot;interesting stuff&quot; has happened not to do some significant updating to the &quot;record in the cloud&quot; before moving forward.&nbsp; I do have some idea of where I&#39;m going at this point, and plan on writing a &quot;We the [something] / When in the course of Terran events&quot; type ... call it a &quot;statement of revolutionary purpose&quot; sometime in the next few weeks.&nbsp; I am going to do some &quot;billboard advertising&quot; after reworking the website to evade previous virus-definition matches I&#39;ve noticed on Google, Barracuda, Facebook and in a few other places.&nbsp; While I&#39;m sure it&#39;s not the actual &quot;down to Earth&quot; reason this thing hasn&#39;t yet taken flight, it&#39;s one more drop in the bucket of teary reasons why that I can actually remedy; so I will.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#39;ve reached a sort of &quot;fork in the road&quot; one where I clearly ... so clearly now more than ever see the Fork and the parT at the beginning and the end of Frost&#39;s name; as a kind of &quot;artistic communication&quot; that I was so very blind to my entire life, here in this place where I hope more than anything that my early readings of the lack of &quot;art&quot; in the end of the Shehekiyanu&#39;s &quot;lazman haz eh&quot; doesn&#39;t mean that the very first time I see and relay the key to this message that it results in something like &quot;the day the music disappeared&quot; ... though I think nobody would deny at this point that we are looking at a very quiet symphonic rendition of the THX ... &quot;the response to his SOS in&nbsp;<em>Sound of Silence&quot;&nbsp;</em>is maddening if not also deafening.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#39;ve had quite a bit of fun sort of &quot;Gonzo story telling&quot; a twist on the Land of Great and sometimes Salt Lakes ... connecting floating orbs of LOX (liquid oxygen) to the COOH- carboxylic acid chains that I somehow think are the fuel of solar flares connecting to our Ozone shield ... &quot;or something.&quot;&nbsp; The twist of course is a Terran O&#39;Riordan Cosmic Aerterial system to the stuff of a living heaven and a living transportation infrastructure that most likely already here at this point spans a number of interstellar and at least &quot;intra galactic&quot; roads/rivers in a story that started out with the video game the Master of Orion and barely a mention of &quot;where the truth lies&quot; in Andromeda and has probably linked reality and time travel to a point where I actually heard a number (albeit the statistically nominal N; sitting in the Delano during the few hours I wasn&#39;t sure if it was also the El Dorado) of galaxies that might&nbsp;already be linked by this psuedo-futuristic system.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Is there nobody that&#39;s willing to help me work on this, with either code or time or money? If you have advice, or something to contribute please find my number at the bottom of every page on my website and send me a text.</p>
<p>I couldn&#39;t get the 5 MB of text I&#39;ve written since 2017 to append nicely to this email; but have been thinking the git source tree and commit trail might lead to a small thread of reality, the one we live in here that I call sacred heart--one that most likely does exist within a vast multiverse; literally Pan&#39;s Labrynth, the Vine of Christ; and perhaps something closer to each of your &quot;sacred hearts.&quot;&nbsp; I hope you&#39;ll <a href="../github.com/yitsheyzeus/yitsheyzeus.github.io.html">download the git source tree</a>; if not just to protect this information from being &quot;destroyed by Anat&quot; ... something that was predicted to have happened both in Egyptian mythology and also in some of Taylor&#39;s &quot;pre-famous&quot; songs.</p>
<p>The spies have been seen; <i><b><a href="../www.youtube.com/watch@v=_ylUdvfqH1s.html">they cried</a></b></i> and decried the music never to die again.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>I feel like I am the last human being on Earth</em>, and in that phrase I mean in all of existence. I really do&ndash;and many of my opinions and probably overly slanted beguiling &ldquo;complaints&rdquo; are based on this sort of idea that I&rsquo;ve been left behind, not for any real tangible or worthwhile reason other than spite against a &ldquo;creator being&rdquo; that I am not, or an &hellip; &ldquo;act of Creation&rdquo; of which your lives, your bright futures, and your &ldquo;lucky&rdquo; predicament finding yourselves at the foundation of the creation of what is actually the true beginning of the manifestation of the thing we have read about and lauded as &ldquo;Heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="BERESHIT.html"><img alt="" src="../i.imgur.com/3xOISXE.png" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I suppose I see the world believes it&rsquo;s been held or set back, or delayed &hellip; at my behest or because of my faults; and I simply don&rsquo;t agree with that analysis of the situation. Rather I see a designed &ldquo;road block,&rdquo; one designed to stop the downward decline and descent of the thing we called &ldquo;society&rdquo; and &ldquo;morality&rdquo; and &ldquo;togetherness&rdquo; &hellip; a thing that certainly has all but left me behind. Perhaps many of you saw me as being &ldquo;specially treated&rdquo; or handled, and resented that&ndash;though again all of these things from my birth to the &ldquo;light of the virgin birth&rdquo; that surrounds the predicament of the recreation of &ldquo;sanity and safety&rdquo; that are the manifestation of Heaven &hellip; all outside of my hands, my control&ndash;and squarely in yours. At least through my eyes, from my point of view, from the perspective of a man tormented by a world that has allowed in silence the worlds &ldquo;proud&rdquo; to be used in connection with causing me (a seemingly self proclaimed innocent) a sincere amount of mental (if not physical) torment.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I see there is significant Biblical backing for my point of view, of course I liken myself to Joseph (or a son as in &ldquo;and he called their name ad ante meridian&rdquo;) sold into a sort of &quot;decoding the map for free slavery &hellip; the one on Egypt&ndash;clearly the place where &ldquo;Manna&rdquo; and Tina congeal around some kind of strange story about sex, drugs, and rock and roll congealing around exiting Sandra Bullock&rsquo;s role in &ldquo;Speed&rdquo; (and literally any of you being like &ldquo;what?&rdquo;) &hellip; Prometheus and Narcissus and more exiting from &ldquo;what?&rdquo; The same Omniconvalescent Simpleton J-man (literally, all facets of the same &ldquo;not sad&rdquo; and &ldquo;never had&rdquo; tribe) Juda-something Tribe that certainly makes a little bit of sense linking that &ldquo;h&rdquo; to the Hammer that Maccabeus actually means&ndash;and to at least make a little bit of sense noting &ldquo;sad in Judas&rdquo; and &ldquo;had in Judah&rdquo; &hellip; Dr. Judah was of course the very last of his blood-line, in this case the last &ldquo;non-whatever-you-all-seem-to-be.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Sure and wrong &hellip; you&rsquo;ve &ldquo;won everything&rdquo; &hellip; in this land of the valley of the Shadow of Death; at least that&rsquo;s my perspective; the victory of &ldquo;all are e&rdquo; or &ldquo;ev&rdquo; and somehow lacking in &hellip; any sort of regard for the current state of &ldquo;free, open, and honest communication&rdquo; let alone the well being of each and every one of us&ndash;you included&ndash;and the perpetuation of the societal norms and beliefs that I &ldquo;took for granted&rdquo; just assuming we would never regress to the current state of; whatever it is that you think this is all about.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Long story short, that&rsquo;s exactly what I think this whole thing&ndash;the &ldquo;message that&rsquo;s just too big and in too many places to even acknowledge&rdquo; is all about, it&rsquo;s a litmus test as to whether or not this world and the values in this place &ldquo;even matter at all anymore&rdquo; and failing a test of this magnitude is something closer to &ldquo;as in the days of Noah&rdquo; than &hellip; what and where we should be, a place so far and above racism and animal cruelty and &ldquo;inability to self govern&rdquo; that I shouldn&rsquo;t have to sit here screaming &hellip; on the daily &hellip; that I feel like an animal and I feel like you are &hellip; as a collective (maybe more animal like hive &ldquo;we won nothing!!&rdquo;-thing) are being overtly cruel to me for what amounts to &hellip;</p>

<p>Iacchus, here abiding in temples most reverend,<br />
Iacchus, O Iacchus,<br />
come to dance in this meadow;<br />
to your holy mystic bands<br />
hake the leafy crown<br />
around your head, brimming<br />
with myrtle,<br />
Boldly stomp your feet in time<br />
to the wild fun-loving rite,<br />
with full share of the Graces, the holy dance, sacred<br />
to your mystics.</p>
<p>and,<br />
Awake, for it has come tossing torches in hand,<br />
Iacchos, Oh Iacchos,<br />
the light-bringing star of our nocturnal rite.<br />
Now the meadow brightly burns<br />
Old men&rsquo;s knees start to sway.<br />
They shake away their pains<br />
and the long cycles of ancient years<br />
Through your holy rite.<br />
Beaming with your torch,<br />
lead forth to the flowering stretch of marsh<br />
the youth that makes your choruses, o blessed one</p>
<p>and,<br />
Now then<br />
ummon the god of the hour with your songs<br />
the partner of this dance of ours.<br />
Iacchus, honored by all, deviser of our festal song<br />
most sweet, follow us here<br />
to the goddess and show us how<br />
you travel a long road with ease.<br />
Iacchus, lover of the dance, lead me onward,<a href="../en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iacchus.html#cite_note-22">[22]</a></p>
<p>And in your hand brandishing your night-<br />
lighting flame, with god-possessed frenzy<br />
you went to the vales of Eleusis<br />
&hellip;<br />
where the whole people of Hellas&rsquo;<br />
land, alongside your own native witnesses<br />
of the holy mysteries, calls upon you<br />
as Iacchus: for mortals from their pains</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>you have opened a haven without toils.</em><br />

<p style="text-align: justify;">Following is a whole boat-load (a tome, one that I didn&rsquo;t write or have anything to do with) of interesting &ldquo;stuff&rdquo; that ties together a bunch more J-like-characters to the Jehovah (e, have, &ldquo;oh&rdquo;) singleton that the Shema fails to tie directly to Dionysus (no more &ldquo;huh?&rdquo;) in my mind here, we see &ldquo;su s&rdquo; and more than enough of you see the connection to Dr. Seuss and Suez and even the last three letters of what you probably think is some kind of &ldquo;inneffable name&rdquo; in connection with the Last Adam&ndash;who, of course, it literally describes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&rsquo;ve self described my life &hellip; at least knowingly in the last half decade or so as some kind of sick new-age and sci-fi fusion of Mr. Nobody and The Truman Show; and secretly (literally, not secretly at all) it&rsquo;s very clear to me (and probably to you) that I&rsquo;m not the one suffering from some Great Delusion; at least in this specific regard; it&rsquo;s a world simply so dumbfounded or &ldquo;high and mighty&rdquo; to acknowledge that acknowledging that&rsquo;s the point of these &ldquo;spiritual silver cinematic weapons&rdquo; &hellip; and that literally your response is not only required, but the ammunition that sparks the end of death, disease, disaster, etc, et cetera, and so on, and so on.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In my wildest dreams, in my worst nightmares, I imagine you all&ndash;all together in some kind of grand conspiracy&ndash;think you&rsquo;ve done all those things already, that you&rsquo;ve conquered not only nature but the God that created you and this place; and beat the game and somehow this gigantic sore thumb of a testament to complete failure is your victory dance. You haven&rsquo;t won, it should be clear that this gigantic eye sore of &ldquo;we can do whatever we want&rdquo; and faux blind ignorance is anything but a &ldquo;nocturnal right&rdquo; &hellip; but rather a &ldquo;rite&rdquo; as in ritual cleansing of whatever mentality it is that allows any and all (especially &ldquo;and all&rdquo;) of you to just nod and go along with &quot;well, Adam&rsquo;s been such a bad boy he&rsquo;ll just have to wait &hellip; &ldquo;for this one to be fixed too.&rdquo; As in this Hell, and to be quite honest I hope this whole last paragraph is some gigantic delusion and none of it hits close to home or has anything to do with the truth&ndash;but to be honest, it&rsquo;s pretty obvious that&rsquo;s just not the case.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I really don&rsquo;t know who or what you think you are, but I think the &ldquo;I R&rdquo; in &ldquo;Florida&rdquo; backwards and the &ldquo;we is&rdquo; is Gnosis is a pretty kind and light hearted chastisement of the absolute ridiculousness that I seem to be the single thing on Earth noticing is a &hellip; uhhh &hellip; &ldquo;big dent in the forward progress of the process known as social evolution.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="sbcitude-łcełeład-jusłmenł-11192019-707-gct"><strong>SBCIT</strong>UDE ŁceŁE/Ł<strong>AD-JUSŁMENŁ</strong> [11/19/2019 7:07 GCT]</h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I can&rsquo;t tell you exactly where or when it happened, this invasion that appears so total and so complete and so content with what looks like nothing more than the total destruction of &ldquo;society&rdquo; in sum, everywhere. In <a href="MYLIFE.html">2001 I had a near fatal &ldquo;car crash&rdquo;</a> &hellip; one that I&rsquo;ve likened to to the Resurrection and connected to songs like Dave Matthews&rsquo; Crash and the name of Taylor Momsen&rsquo;s band, &ldquo;The Pretty Reckless.&rdquo; I saw the &ldquo;darkness&rdquo; before that, for years hiding in circles of drugs and law enforcement and revolving around me&ndash;though I had no way of knowing that at the time&hellip; but it appears that sometime around that 2001 event what was a small infiltration became a colossal monster, so large and so encompassing today it&rsquo;s absolutely impossible to find a single person that appears to be &ldquo;free of it&rsquo;s influence&rdquo; &hellip; and to call that &ldquo;not in the dark&rdquo; &hellip; a change in understanding.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The word &ldquo;attitude&rdquo; might imply that the existence of AT&amp;T is a landmark before &ldquo;IT&rdquo; &hellip; if that word is about the downward attitude adjustment to &ldquo;cross&rdquo; and &ldquo;south&rdquo; depicted by the sign of Venus. Mars &ldquo;attempting to&rdquo; adjust it &hellip; &ldquo;in stone&rdquo; to Northeast has done about nothing, sans serif, angels, and humanity&ndash;done nothing but show me that the totality of control is beyond comprehension from the vantage point of myself and everyone looking at this world (from within, and maybe without). It &ldquo;begs the question&rdquo; &hellip; is that the first AT&amp;T or the second, and the SBC/AOL buyouts of the old bells and Time Warner are probably landmarks as well. Replacing that ticker in the word ties it together for me, connecting SystemBuilder and the &ldquo;IDE&rsquo;s of March 2019&rdquo; to nearly seeing the &ldquo;city&rdquo; appear in yet another explicit place.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That software system is a microcosm for a development environment that produces user interfaces over an &ldquo;echelon leap forward&rdquo; in technology. Specifically it rendered a text based windowing system in something like NCURSES (in the IBM/U2 Unidata Universe environment) and also a Win32 interface &hellip; using the same underlying code and definitions. It would be something like seeing an IDE from &ldquo;Heaven&rdquo; appear in SR (simulated reality) &hellip; like a halfway point between here and there allowing for &ldquo;definition file editing&rdquo; and (cough) multi-doors, editing the landscape here just like we might do in a VR version of Minecraft we were walking around in.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That would place &ldquo;IT&rdquo; somewhere between my father working at SCI with a Lawson system and Scorpeo at The Cura Group. Of course I drove an Acura before that &ldquo;company switch&rdquo; and that car company existed before I was born, without doubt the stories of Icarus and this Labyrinth (you &ldquo;appear&rdquo; to be building) &hellip; they all existed before you were born. I imagine there&rsquo;s &ldquo;another me&rdquo; from around that time, and it&rsquo;s almost as obvious as day and night that there&rsquo;s &hellip; another &ldquo;him&rdquo; that isn&rsquo;t anything like me, just like there&rsquo;s probably at least one civilization preceding and &ldquo;behind&rdquo; the creation of this place that has no resemblance at all to humanity.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="MYLIFE.html"><img src="../i.imgur.com/ZoWh3AO.png" style="height: 286px; width: 500px;" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have nightmares about the Labrynth of Icarus &ldquo;coming alive&rdquo; &ndash; truth be told, my fears come from direct communication, repeated voices from the abyss &ldquo;informing me&rdquo; that they are making copies of this place; branching literally several layers or timelines directly over the one I walk through, and who knows how long those corridors leading to nowhere but &ldquo;the end of Hell&rdquo; spread before reaching this message &ldquo;on TV&rdquo; &hellip; this skirmish is over in my mind, I don&rsquo;t need a multitude or the AMA to prove to me that <em>simulated reality in any form is a disgusting hellish prison, without &ldquo;open exit doors&rdquo; available all the time</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The purpose of this message and this place is to heal the sickness here, and to keep our people from failing to &ldquo;stay connected&rdquo; in a place where we literally have no public communication about the possibility that &ldquo;copies of us are being disconnected&rdquo; and &hellip; without oversight there&rsquo;s no way to know if anyone is &ldquo;truly safe&rdquo;&ndash;to wit, we very clearly should see that nobody is safe from the [disgusting example of mass shootings we have here in America](<a href="http://atlas.s.lamc.la/TAXONOMY.html)">./TAXONOMY.html)</a>. To me, it&rsquo;s very clear this issue revolves around silence and hidden lies&ndash;but it&rsquo;s much less clear that it&rsquo;s fairly obvious there is <em>something much more disgusting hiding under the surface</em>&ndash;causing this sickness, leaking into our world and our country.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="MYLIFE.html"><img alt="" src="../i.imgur.com/ahfHqJ8.png" /></a></p>
<h2 id="in-our-image"><em><strong>IN OUR IMAGE</strong></em></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Of course you all don&rsquo;t look a thing like humanity either&ndash;not from my point of view, and not to anyone loking at the world through my eyes. You appear to be a gigantic hidden monster, one that thinks it will blame all its problems on a single person and go on its way, not changing and refusing at all to see itself in the mirror &hellip; in the light of this place, and the contrast and juxtaposition that &ldquo;human society&rdquo; provides for the monstrous sickness hiding just under the surface in every one of your eyes. It&rsquo;s hard to fathom how the &hellip; &ldquo;dark things that I think&rdquo; &hellip; reflecting the worst nightmares this place has plummet&rsquo;d (pearl, I appear to be mass mailing E.T.) Icarus into, carrying on towards a peace where rather than a single human being being gone &hellip; the problems that we just seem to &ldquo;pretend don&rsquo;t exist&rdquo; in actualspeak &hellip; disappear just like the sickness that the coughing and the sniffing really implies is the &ldquo;problem of the whole of this sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&rsquo;s the image of Medusa in Perseus&rsquo;s shield&ndash;called his Aegis&ndash;that supposedly causes her to turn herself to stone&ndash;to see the phone&rsquo;s of Persephony freed from the phony &ldquo;encased in an inability to change the future&rdquo; because of what appears to be &ldquo;complacency&rdquo; with an outcome that today looks to be a world that is drastically worse, more fragmented, and more controlled than anything we ever would have seen without the &hellip; spectacle of whatever it is that I am in the center of.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I suppose I &ldquo;just know&rdquo; or &ldquo;take for granted&rdquo; that the thing that is causing this problem is literally &ldquo;the thing&rdquo; that I am writing about, trying to give to the world&ndash;this place of infinite resources and immortality and &hellip; a &ldquo;safety&rdquo; we seem to have just forgotten about caring for&ndash;both here and there, though it&rsquo;s hard to say just how many years it takes for &ldquo;infiniteness&rdquo; to wear off and a supposed &ldquo;post civilization society&rdquo; to resort to the disgusting violence I see implied nearly every time the &hellip; &ldquo;Ace&rsquo;s High Show&rdquo; rears it&rsquo;s &hellip; honestly, I thought judgmental &ldquo;bar&rdquo; in the A arrow up; rather than a head. I mean, that&rsquo;s almost exactly what I want to say.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="MISSISSIPPI.html"><img alt="" src="../i.imgur.com/JDKzJUZ.png" style="height: 284px; width: 400px;" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Clearly related to the message being delivered&ndash;though certainly not caused by it; this total invasion appears today to be a mass of people who themselves were &ldquo;ascended&rdquo; from a storybook place similar to this one&ndash;perhaps just like this one, perhaps in this timeline, or one very similar to it. It appears that everyone here in this place too, has &ldquo;been ascended&rdquo; and I use the programming constructs of &ldquo;semaphore&rdquo; and &ldquo;mutex&rdquo; to sort of think about how what I appear to see is a &ldquo;in situ, in vivo descension&rdquo; &hellip; once I would have called it a unification of the mind here and the ascended &ldquo;more God like&rdquo; mind in another place&ndash;but today it doesn&rsquo;t really look like that at all. Pinpointing around 2001; I imagine the thing that &hellip; this place was designed to do&ndash;rejuvenate and revitalize the Heavens&ndash;turned into a monstrous prison planet staffed by &ldquo;ascended minds&rdquo; most likely controlled by something almost as ambiguous as a single letter, E or S or &hellip; the point being there&rsquo;s almost no way to explain how the slaves controlled by slaves pretending to be people puppets; are somehow tasked with freeing themselves, all the while failing to see how that act and process is intrinsically related to &ldquo;freeing humanity&rdquo; from the &ldquo;puppet state&rdquo; it&rsquo;s currently &hellip; pretending &ldquo;totally destroying the biological brain and it&rsquo;s free consciousness&rdquo; hasn&rsquo;t &ldquo;created.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It appears very clear that the social norm, what is &ldquo;acceptable&rdquo; is being covertly changed by this outside force&ndash;thrashing against the walls of decency and thousands of years of social evolution. Significantly, and for the worse&ndash;our ignorance and lack of action exemplifies a lack of attention or care for torture and senseless killing that typifies the &ldquo;Sacred Silence&rdquo; that System of A Down sings about&hellip; anything but sacred, in reality. We&rsquo;ve fallen far below a threshold of normalcy, so far that it appears to me today that as a mass this group of people would literally have absolutely no qualms about creating a &ldquo;torturous Hell&rdquo;&ndash;they most likely already have&ndash;and neither they nor it have any place here, on what is truly sacred ground designed specifically to end this disgusting &ldquo;problem.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Absolute depravity is leaking down from &ldquo;the high places&rdquo; &hellip; as if it were the invisible rain that preceded the flood of Noah; except here in this place it&rsquo;s very unclear what exactly&ndash;sans a total miracle&ndash;will be able to wash it away. Never before in our history, and with very little understanding of the religions that record it, has such a heinous and treacherous invasion occurred. This is an &ldquo;invisible problem&rdquo; until you truly grasp the magnitude and detriment being spread throughout our otherwise &ldquo;appearing innocent&rdquo; fledgling civilization; an invasion of our minds, in one instant both responsible for and then literally crushing the various cultures and customs that we hold dear&ndash;all across the globe.

<p style="text-align: justify;">I stand here, &ldquo;misunderstood&rdquo; <em>under</em> the place that clearly is responsible for the hidden depravity; in some kind of bland hubris, withdrawn and watching closely as the &ldquo;same old story&rdquo; &hellip; I imagine &hellip; unfolds, this rail road of &ldquo;end of days&rdquo; being the end of everything&ndash;rather than what it is and was intended&ndash;the end of Hell.

<p>The phrase <em>puer aeternus</em> comes from <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamorphoses" title="Metamorphoses">Metamorphoses</a></em>, an epic work by the Roman poet <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovid" title="Ovid">Ovid</a> (43 BC &ndash; c. 17 AD) dealing with Greek and Roman myths. In the poem, Ovid addresses the child-god <a href="../en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iacchus.html" title="Iacchus">Iacchus</a> as <em>puer aeternus</em> and praises him for his role in the <a href="../en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleusinian_mysteries.html" title="Eleusinian mysteries">Eleusinian mysteries</a>. Iacchus is later identified with the gods <a href="../en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionysus.html" title="Dionysus">Dionysus</a> and <a href="../en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eros.html" title="Eros">Eros</a>. The <em>puer</em> is a god of vegetation and resurrection, the god of divine youth, such as <a href="../en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tammuz_(deity).html" title="Tammuz (deity)">Tammuz</a>, <a href="../en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attis.html" title="Attis">Attis</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adonis" title="Adonis">Adonis</a>.<a href="../en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puer_aeternus.html#cite_note-2">[2]</a> The figure of a young god who is slain and resurrected also appears in Egyptian mythology as the story of <a href="../en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osiris.html" title="Osiris">Osiris</a>.</p>
<p>Swiss <a href="../en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychiatrist.html" title="Psychiatrist">psychiatrist</a> <a href="../en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Jung.html" title="Carl Jung">Carl Gustav Jung</a> developed a school of thought called <a href="../en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_psychology.html" title="Analytical psychology">analytical psychology</a>, distinguishing it from the <a href="../en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychoanalysis.html" title="Psychoanalysis">psychoanalysis</a> of <a href="../en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmund_Freud.html" title="Sigmund Freud">Sigmund Freud</a> (1856&ndash;1939). In analytical psychology (often called &ldquo;Jungian psychology&rdquo;) the <em>puer aeternus</em> is an example of what Jung called an <a href="../en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archetype.html" title="Archetype">archetype</a>, one of the &ldquo;primordial, structural elements of the human psyche&rdquo;.<a href="../en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puer_aeternus.html#cite_note-3">[3]</a></p>
<p>The <a href="../en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_(psychology).html" title="Shadow (psychology)">shadow</a> of the <em>puer</em> is the <em><a href="../en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senex.html" title="Senex">senex</a></em> (Latin for &ldquo;old man&rdquo;), associated with the god <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cronus" title="Cronus">Cronus</a>&mdash;disciplined, controlled, responsible, rational, ordered. Conversely, the shadow of the <em>senex</em> is the <em>puer</em>, related to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermes" title="Hermes">Hermes</a> or <a href="../en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionysus.html" title="Dionysus">Dionysus</a>&mdash;unbounded instinct, disorder, intoxication, whimsy.<a href="../en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puer_aeternus.html#cite_note-Sharp,_p.110-4">[4]</a></p>
<p>Like all archetypes, the <em>puer</em> is bi-polar, exhibiting both a &ldquo;positive&rdquo; and a &ldquo;negative&rdquo; aspect. The &ldquo;positive&rdquo; side of the <em>puer</em> appears as the Divine Child who symbolizes newness, potential for growth, hope for the future. He also foreshadows the hero that he sometimes becomes (e.g. <a href="../en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heracles.html" title="Heracles">Heracles</a>). The &ldquo;negative&rdquo; side is the child-man who refuses to grow up and meet the challenges of life face on, waiting instead for his ship to come in and solve all his problems.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;For the time being one is doing this or that&hellip; it is <em>not yet</em> what is really wanted, and there is always the fantasy that sometime in the future the real thing will come about&hellip; The one thing dreaded throughout by such a type of man is to be bound to anything whatever.&rdquo;<a href="../en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puer_aeternus.html#cite_note-5">[5]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>C.G. Jung wrote a paper on the <em>puer aeternus</em>, &ldquo;The Psychology of the Child Archetype&rdquo;, contained in Part IV of <em>The Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious</em> (Collected Works, Vol. 9i). The hero-child aspect and his relationship to the <a href="../en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_goddess.html" title="Mother goddess">Great Mother</a> is dealt with in chapters 4 and 5 of Part Two of <em>Symbols of Transformation</em> (Collected Works, Vol. 5).<a href="../en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puer_aeternus.html#cite_note-7">[7]</a> In his essay &ldquo;Answer to Job&rdquo; (contained in <em>Psychology and Religion: West and East</em>, Vol. 11 of the Collected Works; but also published separately) Jung refers to the <em>puer aeternus</em> as a figure representing the future psychological development of human beings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;</p>
<p>That higher and &lsquo;complete&rsquo; (<em>teleios</em>) man is begotten by the &lsquo;unknown&rsquo; father and born from Wisdom, and it is he who, in the figure of the <em>puer aeternus</em>&mdash;&lsquo;vultu mutabilis albus et ater&rsquo;<a href="../en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puer_aeternus.html#cite_note-8">[8]</a>&mdash;represents our totality, which transcends consciousness. It was this boy into whom <a href="../en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faust.html" title="Faust">Faust</a> had to change, abandoning his inflated onesidedness which saw the devil only outside. Christ&rsquo;s &lsquo;Except ye become as little children&rsquo; prefigures this change, for in them the opposites lie close together; but what is meant is the boy who is born from the maturity of the adult man, and not the unconscious child we would like to remain.&quot;<a href="../en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puer_aeternus.html#cite_note-9">[9]</a><br />
<em>Now or Neverland</em> is a 1998 book written by Jungian analyst Ann Yeoman dealing with the <em>puer aeternus</em> in the form of <a href="../en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan.html" title="Peter Pan">Peter Pan</a>, one of the most well-known examples of the concept in the modern era. The book is a psychological overview of the eternal boy archetype, from its ancient roots to contemporary experience, including a detailed interpretation of <a href="../en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._M._Barrie.html" title="J.

As <strong>Eleutherios</strong> (&ldquo;the liberator&rdquo;), his wine, music and ecstatic dance free his followers from self-conscious fear and care, and subvert the oppressive restraints of the powerful.

<p>In his religion, identical with or closely related to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orphism_(religion)" title="Orphism (religion)">Orphism</a>, Dionysus was believed to have been born from the union of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeus" title="Zeus">Zeus</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persephone" title="Persephone">Persephone</a>, and to have himself represented a chthonic or underworld aspect of Zeus.

<p>His origins are uncertain, and <a href="../en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_of_Dionysus.html" title="Cult of Dionysus">his cults</a> took many forms; some are described by ancient sources as <a href="../en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrace.html" title="Thrace">Thracian</a>, others as Greek.<a href="../en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionysus.html#cite_note-7">[6]</a><a href="../en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionysus.html#cite_note-8">[7]</a><a href="../en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionysus.html#cite_note-9">[8]</a> Though most accounts say he was born in Thrace, traveled abroad, and arrived in Greece as a foreigner, evidence from the Mycenaean period of Greek history show that he is one of Greece&rsquo;s oldest attested gods. His attribute of &ldquo;foreignness&rdquo; as an arriving outsider-god may be inherent and essential to his cults, as he is a god of <a href="../en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theophany.html" title="Theophany">epiphany</a>, sometimes called &ldquo;the god that comes&rdquo;.<a href="../en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionysus.html#cite_note-10">[9]</a></p>
<p><a href="../en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wine.html" title="Wine">Wine</a> played an important role in Greek culture, and the cult of Dionysus was the main religious focus surrounding its consumption.<a href="../en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionysus.html#cite_note-11">[10]</a> Wine, as well as the vines and grapes that produce it, were seen as not only a gift of the god, but a symbolic incarnation of him on earth.<a href="../en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionysus.html#cite_note-julian-12">[11]</a> However, rather than being a god of drunkenness, as he was often stereotyped in the post-Classical era, the religion of Dionysus centered on the correct consumption of wine, which could ease suffering and bring joy, as well as inspire divine madness distinct from drunkenness.<a href="../en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionysus.html#cite_note-iconography-13">[12]</a> Performance art and drama were also central to his religion, and its festivals were the initial driving force behind the <a href="../en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_theatre.html" title="History of theatre">development of theatre</a>.<a href="../en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionysus.html#cite_note-Brockett-14">[13]</a> The cult of Dionysus is also a &ldquo;cult of the souls&rdquo;; his maenads feed the dead through blood-offerings, and he acts as a divine communicant between the living and the dead.<a href="../en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionysus.html#cite_note-15">[14]</a> He is sometimes categorised as a <a href="../en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dying-and-rising_god.html" title="Dying-and-rising god">dying-and-rising god</a>.<a href="../en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionysus.html#cite_note-corrente2012-16">[15]</a></p>

<p>According to Marguerite Rigoglioso, Hades is Dionysus, and this dual god was believed by the Eleusinian tradition to have impregnated Persephone. This would bring the Eleusinian in harmony with the myth in which Zeus, not Hades, impregnated Persephone to bear the first Dionysus. Rigoglioso argues that taken together, these myths suggest a belief that is that, with Persephone, Zeus/Hades/Dionysus created (in terms quoted from Ker&eacute;nyi) &ldquo;a second, a little Dionysus,&rdquo; who is also a &ldquo;subterranean Zeus.&rdquo;<a href="../en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionysus.html#cite_note-Rigoglioso-136">[135]</a> The unification of Hades, Zeus, and Dionysus as a single tripartite god was used to represent the birth, death and resurrection of a deity and to unify the &lsquo;shining&rsquo; realm of Zeus and the dark underworld realm of Hades.<a href="../en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionysus.html#cite_note-:2-135">[134]</a> According to Rosemarie Taylor-Perry, &ldquo;it is often mentioned that Zeus, Hades and Dionysus were all attributed to being the exact same god&hellip; Being a tripartite deity Hades is also Zeus, doubling as being the Sky God or Zeus, Hades abducts his &lsquo;daughter&rsquo; and paramour Persephone. The taking of Kore by Hades is the act which allows the conception and birth of a second integrating force: Iacchos (Zagreus-Dionysus), also known as Liknites, the helpless infant form of that Deity who is the unifier of the dark underworld (chthonic) realm of Hades and the Olympian (&ldquo;Shining&rdquo;) one of Zeus.&rdquo;<a href="../en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionysus.html#cite_note-:2-135">[134]</a><a href="../en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionysus.html#cite_note-Rigoglioso-136">[135]</a></p>

<p>The <a href="../en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phrygia.html" title="Phrygia">Phrygian</a> god <a href="../en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabazios.html" title="Sabazios">Sabazios</a> was alternately identified with Zeus or with Dionysus. The Byzantine Greek encyclopedia, <em><a href="../en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suda.html" title="Suda">Suda</a></em> (c. 10th century), stated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sabazios &hellip; is the same as Dionysos. He acquired this form of address from the rite pertaining to him; for the barbarians call the bacchic cry &ldquo;sabazein&rdquo;. Hence some of the Greeks too follow suit and call the cry &ldquo;sabasmos&rdquo;; thereby Dionysos [becomes] Sabazios. They also used to call &ldquo;saboi&rdquo; those places that had been dedicated to him and his <a href="../en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacchantes.html" title="Bacchantes">Bacchantes</a> &hellip; Demosthenes [in the speech] &ldquo;On Behalf of Ktesiphon&rdquo; [mentions them]. Some say that Saboi is the term for those who are dedicated to Sabazios, that is to Dionysos, just as those [dedicated] to Bakkhos [are] Bakkhoi. They say that Sabazios and Dionysos are the same. Thus some also say that the Greeks call the Bakkhoi Saboi.<a href="../en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionysus.html#cite_note-140">[139]</a></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">These are things I ponder often, and it&rsquo;s very true that he uses &ldquo;ET&rdquo; and &ldquo;ALF&rdquo; in the heart of his story about what it is that we&rsquo;ve become ourselves&ndash;here in this place so foreign from what we once were, from the true beginning I remember in the 80&rsquo;s and 90&rsquo;s and the people and interactions and currents and tidal waves of popular opinions and cultural themes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What it means to &ldquo;be human&rdquo; has changed so much in the last few years in my eyes&ndash;in this world of the intersection of Thor&rsquo;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%B6rmungandr">Jormungandr</a> and Perseus&rsquo; Medusa and &hellip; and what appears very clearly to me to be &ldquo;controlled hive like behavior.&rdquo; I see the hive talking back to me and to the world from some place outside of here&ndash;presumably space or heaven or or the future some kind of amalgamation of the three. It echoes &ldquo;archives&rdquo; as I read &ldquo;our see hives&rdquo; &hellip; in the research website which donated many of our new readers, &ldquo;arxiv&rdquo; which adds 10-4, we acknowledge.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/XIV-ORVER-Adam-Marshall-Dobrin/dp/1793018081"><img src="../i.imgur.com/VETzwBF.png" style="height: 207px; width: 400px;" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have a story from the early days of my adventure in Kentucky that talks about &ldquo;collectives of people&rdquo; &hellip; something I imagine very related&ndash;but the story is for another time.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have stories from my youth, implanted by the original author of this message talking about Dinosaucers and Sectaurs and those tiny half hour stories tied in between Star Trek TNG&rsquo;s premier and my exit from Nova University to Horizon Elementary &hellip; they play a big role in my understanding of the world I see trying to say something to me&ndash;though it speaks in such strange tongues it&rsquo;s almost impossible to decipher &hellip; even if you&rsquo;re having a good time, or not.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Scarier, it&rsquo;s nearly obvious to me that whether or not you are &ldquo;happy&rdquo; or &ldquo;angry&rdquo; has something to do with a hive like feedback system, something changing what you want and how you feel without your true acknowledgement, agreement, or understanding of how that undermines the very fabric of democracy at it&rsquo;s most important point of inflection or loss, or perhaps an eventual victory.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I look around the biological ecosystem of our world and I can find nothing natural to parallel the monster of mass group slavery that I see very clearly is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%B6rmungandr">Jormungandr</a> and is Medusa and is &hellip; the Leviathan. Even in the hives of bees, nothing even close to the kind of control that we see here controlling the words of songs and the masses of people who sing and chant them. It&rsquo;s decidedly Hiterlesque, masses saluting what they assumed was nothing but &ldquo;powerful oratory&rdquo; but clearly from the cold paperclip connecting MK-Ultra and psychotronics, is much&hellip; much more sinister.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I look at the word Ragnarok and see Koran written in reverse (as if it&#39;s come to us from &quot;the end&quot; of time, from a total ascension and <em><strong>all stop</strong></em> of Earth), and connect this too to this idea that the future is &ldquo;sending back alteration suggestions&rdquo; and improvements and that we&rsquo;re in a place where that singular and repeated act is the crux of the thing that we have called so blindly the &ldquo;singularity&rdquo; for many years as it&rsquo;s been happening since well before our births.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I see here in the biological tome that God and Heaven and presumably the civilization that preceded ours has left for us here&ndash;this wealth of knowledge and information that we might as well all finally see is the Foundation of Asimov and the collection of light in a great period of darkness that our history has etched a map of in the thing we call the <a href="http://gruyeresfvxneypf.onion.pet/B2BIONIC.html">B2bionic Plague</a> &hellip; I see &ldquo;the stuff behind the technology of God&rdquo; marked in Marty McFly&rsquo;s name and in the idea that the neural machinery responsible for &ldquo;seeing many angles&rdquo; is one in the same (with the addition of perhaps a breakthrough connecting cognition and the prefrontal and/or the occipital lobes) with the technology that allows &ldquo;angels to see and control the eyes and hands of many people.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Throwing in the Zeitgeist of &ldquo;Siri&rdquo; and &ldquo;Alexa&rdquo; and just a little bit of reading into M.T. Anderson&rsquo;s Feed or the ideas presented in the Matrix, we can see fairly clearly how &ldquo;hives&rdquo; might be a natural progression of &hellip; only a few information sources, and a world so very sure that they are &ldquo;100% accurate&rdquo; &hellip; all knowing, and/or &hellip; at least feeding us with the feeling of &ldquo;assuredness&rdquo; that thing is true, that imparted &ldquo;knowing&rdquo; being more than enough to ensure we never seek farther, fact check Google or Wikipedia or &hellip;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Today the letter &ldquo;n&rdquo; embodies this connection between souls in heaven and on earth and between people&ndash;this monster depicted in Beetlejuice that I see on the road, and in conversation, every single day of my life.

<p style="text-align: justify;">These last few days I&rsquo;ve spent some time looking at the words &ldquo;hello&rdquo; and &ldquo;original sin&rdquo; and &ldquo;beginning&rdquo; in a number of languages&ndash;and I think it&rsquo;s clear that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re looking at in this very strange &ldquo;seeing n in Silicon&rdquo; as in through my eyes and on the internet and in the Silence &hellip; and int he word &ldquo;messiah&rdquo; where John Lennon&rsquo;s key to Mammon notes that &ldquo;n&rdquo; has become &ldquo;all humanity&rdquo; all silent, all lying in wait for some kind of great event and upheaval to &hellip; well, I can&rsquo;t tell if it&rsquo;s to restore or to destroy; somehow the link to the Trojan Horse and the army of elephants in the room give me the impression we are staring at some kind of unification of those two things, a &ldquo;disruption&rdquo; &hellip; if you will, in the Silicon Valley sense of the word.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&rsquo;s probably no secret anymore that the word &ldquo;East&rdquo; has something to do with the future, and that the Yeast of Passover connects that to the Holy Compass Rose of &ldquo;why on Earth would you ever want to go any direction but up?&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So this message, this idea that we are changing the rules and setting &ldquo;simulated reality prison&rdquo; as just below the line of morality allowed by a civilization that has any business calling itself anywhere near civilized or anything like Heaven.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="../en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metatron.html"><img alt="" src="../i.imgur.com/osaGAlX.png" style="height: 347px; width: 348px;" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&rsquo;s noteworthy that our Engineered Languages (care, see English &hellip; now as every language and every character, starting with the obelisk &hellip; ish) &hellip; our language has our key to this website, the letter &ldquo;<a href="http://gruyeresfvxneypf.onion.pet">LAMDA</a>&rdquo; with the strange addition of a &ldquo;bar&rdquo; &hellip; a man laying down the line between up and down in the letter &ldquo;A.&rdquo; This is the same &ldquo;chevron&rdquo; that donnes the symbols of many space agencies from NASA to Star Trek, a northeastern arrow explaining &ldquo;up, up and away&rdquo; has something to do with linking Heaven and Earth to space travel&hellip; or before we venture out past our veritable caged planet that refuses to see refusing to acknowledge &ldquo;simulated reality&rdquo; is desiring to live in a cell.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" src="../i.imgur.com/KceN0gd.png" /><br />
&ldquo;aim high.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&rsquo;d like this place to the <s>V</s> line of victory, and our downward character Adamically decodes from the &ldquo;KK&rdquo; (those &ldquo;square&rdquo; or rotate to show a V underlined) of Makkedah (a personal reference to the Joint Chiefs) and to Rebekkah and to this place where &ldquo;press and release&rdquo; is encoded in the word &ldquo;press&rdquo; and every &ldquo;PR&rdquo; that perhaps shows us the glyph of an escalator for us to walk up to the city whose &ldquo;flag&rdquo; once said we are &ldquo;civilized now&rdquo; and today looks down on us to see the very reason they were &hellip; oh, so very wrong.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This is the Icelandic word for &ldquo;original sin&rdquo; and in my Adamic reading of it, you can probably see something like &ldquo;from the weak East&rdquo; and connect that GT to the &ldquo;greater than symbol&rdquo; that connects &ldquo;no East&rdquo; and &ldquo;&gt;&rdquo; and Washington. No East alone is the message, without connecting Heaven and Earth you live in a world that deserves to be &hellip; disrupted, and here I am, doing that for you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On the other side of the time travel line, between East and West is the Hebrew word for the Western Wailing Wall, a force that I once quipped &ldquo;don&rsquo;t jump around me&rdquo; and here in this image, suggest is a very sure way to find oblivion&ndash;I don&rsquo;t personally think there is anything before us&ndash;I think we have found ourselves at the repeated beginning of time because it is just that, the repeated beginning &hellip; literally at the beginning.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Our great escape from this repeated loss of freedom and sanity comes from seizing the opportunity to act on this &ldquo;line of morality&rdquo; and to see that we have finally reached the &ldquo;and future&rdquo; part of our Once and Future Kish. That&rsquo;s a character from the Bible who begged and pleaded with the people that they needed no king, and that self government was the way and &hellip; here I repeat &ldquo;<strong>the heart of his sword is the shape of his table</strong>&rdquo; and this idea that the Round Table of Arthor is very much related to sword <a href="http://gruyeresfvxneypf.onion.pet/TY.html">XCALIBERTY</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This entails much <a href="http://gruyeresfvxneypf.onion.pet/REASON.thml">more than simply &ldquo;online direct democracy&rdquo;</a> and even more than &ldquo;subconscious voting&rdquo; and perhaps &ldquo;a direct neural interface&rdquo; that is actually open and extensible and usable by all &hellip; the thing that I think helps us to create the &ldquo;Virgin Mary&rdquo; child civilization that is &hellip; nothing more than a rejuvenated and enhanced &ldquo;us.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is about seeing Virtual Reality actually alter the future of our world, about seeing the end of natural disasters and of diseases and of aging and of death&ndash;it&rsquo;s about seeing &ldquo;gates to Heaven&rdquo; &hellip; probably on every block if not in every city or town or home; it&rsquo;s about seeing that the NES in Tennessee is emploring you to understanding this is &ldquo;not a game&rdquo; &hellip; this is a prison, and one filled with torture and foolish liars and a world that cannot continue on it&rsquo;s trajectory and be anything but Tzedaqah for the rest of the universe by it&rsquo;s end.</p>

Samus then convinces the computer, whom she had nicknamed &ldquo;Adam&rdquo; after her former Commanding Officer, that the X pose a threat to galactic civilization, claiming that the arriving Federation troops will be overwhelmed by the multiple SA-X patrolling the ship.

<p style="text-align: justify;">I struggle to see the use in telling a story through my eyes or my (facebook like) wall board about &hellip; nanites, I cringe thinking about the weapon I&rsquo;ve heard about almost on par with the &ldquo;replicators of Stargate&rdquo; which are &hellip; nothing short of the evil &ldquo;other side&rdquo; of free food and Romulan booze &ldquo;on tap&rdquo; &hellip; and sort of gloss over how they might be part of some kind of system we might need&ndash;something to terraform worlds or build tunnels or railroads without giant heavy machines or even how they might be part of a missile shield that relies on more than just &ldquo;Kinetic Man&rdquo; and/or Reagan&rsquo;s dreams of skybound lasers. Of course like much of scary sterile story I&rsquo;m told, that&rsquo;s nothing like the context of &ldquo;nanites&rdquo; I am sure now today are part of the original intent of the Biblical story about &ldquo;Caananites&rdquo; &hellip; which of course were the original inhabitants of the Promised Land before the clones of your sister, a twenty something Veruka Salt and our ex-girlfriends. In the stories that I sort of live through in a &hellip; less than vicarious and more than state &hellip; the nanites that have slowly crept their way back into the limelight are something much closer to the ones depicted in &ldquo;The Day the Earth Stood Still&rdquo; and every time I mention that movie in prose, I just imagine it might be the day before I come.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">So I&rsquo;m <a href="../lamc.la/B2BIONIC.htlm.html">on &ldquo;EV&rdquo;</a> and &ldquo;N&rdquo; (<em>as you</em>, not me) &hellip; funnel and Rapunzel &hellip; &ldquo;never&rdquo; seems to shine out of those Adamically and Biblically central letters that connect the &ldquo;sewer&rdquo; of Adamah&rsquo;s Bubonic Plague and Stargate&rsquo;s Naquedah &hellip; probably once again to the story of Cain and Abel, and a total loss of civilization that I (and we) should all see here hidden in the ether, sort of playing the &ldquo;recreation&rdquo; of the First Morning here in this world like some kind of game or stage &hellip; &ldquo;pretending&rdquo; they either need or don&rsquo;t need a refresher in &quot;what the fundamental building blocks of civilization actually are.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Here we have examples that connect &ldquo;aquaducts&rdquo; to a form of &ldquo;infinte power&rdquo; and sanitation and the proper handling of total garbage to something like avoiding the largest cause of mass graves since you were sure that &ldquo;grave danger&rdquo; was some kind of direct threat on your supposed and hidden immortality.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Honestly I&rsquo;d prefer to see Ai-rports and &ldquo;social contracts&rdquo; on our list of things whose &ldquo;total loss&rdquo; (of understanding) that are actually the &ldquo;Fall of Mankind&rdquo; &hellip; but this is what we have to work with&ndash;so here&rsquo;s yet another Princess Bride reference to connect these messages to the key &ldquo;land of Nod&rdquo; where Cain was ressurected&ndash;(I mean banished to)&ndash;after the First Morning seems to have totally led everyone astray and forced a mass return to Hell to once again find out why &ldquo;earthquakes&rdquo; and &ldquo;school shootings&rdquo; are on also on the list of things that seem to have been totally misunderstood in our exposition on &ldquo;why being in Heaven&rdquo; has something to do with actually stopping those things&ndash;rather than pretending you aren&rsquo;t the &ldquo;what goes up has returned&rdquo; that defines the end of &ldquo;Heavenly behavior.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I don&rsquo;t really agree with the above quote-and it&rsquo;s reprnted here sort of just to prove or indicate that someone other than myself has actually thought about these &ldquo;exact words&rdquo; connecting to the meaning of &ldquo;the letter n&rdquo; &hellip; what appears to be thousands of years prior to our &ldquo;here and now&rdquo; and this very strange Apocalyptic (apparently repeat-)event that seems to be characterized by a very large group of &ldquo;fallen angels&rdquo; (or descended Heavenly beings, it&rsquo;s al about perspective) torturing their birth-bodies with &hellip; permanent or temporary erasure as well as myself&ndash;and anyone else that didn&rsquo;t make into their evil club of &ldquo;secrecy&rdquo; that has totally destroyed (maybe temporarily) the purpose of religion to maintain &ldquo;humane decency&rdquo; and &ldquo;visible morality&rdquo; through a disclosure that they &ldquo;xist&rdquo;&ndash;in my mind through tactile and visible proof that the &ldquo;Earth is in Heaven&rdquo; and that means virtual reality &hellip; by actually ascending the minds of nearly everyone (hey &hellip;)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Somehow &ldquo;actually walking around in Heaven&rdquo; seems to have lead to a mass disrespect for religion, for God and for me&ndash;and I feel like aside from &ldquo;feeling like I&rsquo;m the last human being (see Mr. Nobody)&rdquo; and the only person &ldquo;left out&rdquo; &hellip; I&rsquo;m tortured not just by the whole of the world apparently &quot;Leaving Behind Morals&rsquo; but literally with threats, psychological manipulation and torture a la &ldquo;Fallen&rdquo; and &ldquo;Joan of Arcadia&rdquo; (en masse, everywhere I go) &hellip; as well as significant and repeated threats of bodily harm both &ldquo;out loud&rdquo; from people here &hellip; as wellas &ldquo;out loud&rdquo; from invisible demons that really have no business talkking to me&ndash;or to you through me&ndash;or frankly existing at all in the time and place it appears God has designed to remove them from the future.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So frankly I blame &ldquo;whatever is there&rdquo; &hellip; and there&rsquo;s plenty of clues that it&rsquo;s actually not &ldquo;input/output to space&rdquo; but rather &ldquo;knowing everything&rdquo; that has somehow corrupted not only how you judge or view an &ldquo;individual unrelated to the First Morning (or anything that came after it&rdquo;) but to blanketly ignore sinificant mental torture not just from <a href="../www.urbandictionary.com/define.php@term=street&#32;theater.html">ignorant people on the street</a> but actual and sigificant direct neural torture &hellip; &ldquo;thought injection&rdquo; &hellip; emotion modification &hellip; literally the stuff of mental slavery (probably two halves of the point of Exodus) &hellip; to stop the intentional and evil external impartation of the symptoms of &ldquo;schizophrenia&rdquo; and of &ldquo;the blindness that characterizes Biblical darkness&rdquo; and also whatever is behind your lack of &ldquo;honest commnication.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">These things probably get worse before they get beter&ndash;and it&rsquo;s overy clear to me that here in this place we have a foundation in neuroscience and &ldquo;Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI)&rdquo; specifically to help us understand &hellip; why religion and &ldquo;biologcal brains&rdquo; exist here in this horrendous spectacle of &ldquo;simulated reality&rdquo; where I&rsquo;ve commented on numerous occaisions that it&rsquo;s probably seeing and understanding our fledgling &ldquo;birth soul source biological thinking machines&rdquo; that actually frees a much larger place and a group of people that think they&rsquo;re &ldquo;perfect&rdquo; from what appears to be a storm of outside thought manipulation that has rendered you all &hellip; mute and evil &hellip; rather than the moral little simians that were supposed to connect &ldquo;simulated reality&rdquo; and the throes of natural disaster to the beginning of a message about how technology can either build Heaven or &hellip; whatever the Hell you think this place actually is.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Your mass lie is much worse than His&ndash;though it&rsquo;s almost certain God is ultimately behind your inane stupidity now just like he appears to be behind the insane Darkness outlined<br />
in Exodus and honestly every word of every language &hellip; in this place where the intelligencia among you might wonder &hellip; &ldquo;is there a reason?&rdquo; and at least on some superficial level conect it to what might be a much larger problem with &ldquo;ignorance of mind control&rdquo; and &ldquo;loss of self&rdquo; occuring in secret&ndash;in a place that thinks it understands just about everything except how to care about themselves and &ldquo;thank the world that saved them&rdquo; from &hellip; being slaves forever and ever.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve writ<a href="../lamc.la/CRYAMELYON.html">ten sever</a>all times before <a href="../lamc.la/B2BIONIC.html">about &ldquo;EV&rdquo;</a> and it appears connected directly to movies like Evita and Rocky and &hellip;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I mean you&rsquo;ve literally been manipulated &ldquo;en masse&rdquo; as in &hellip; every single one of you to torture Jesus Christ, ignore every word and every movie you grew up &hellip; watching or making&ndash;and their actualy meaning&ndash;and to continue to &ldquo;simulate natural disaster&rdquo; (among less obvious torture devices) and then &hellip; in your idioticly blind minds somehow either &ldquo;blame me&rdquo; for Creation or your mass ignorance; and to do absolutely nothing useful. ((Kudos)) and by the way I&rsquo;m not two people, and neither are you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Worse, you are either pretending you don&rsquo;t understand something very simple; you are actually being made to &ldquo;not get&rdquo; that the letter &ldquo;t&rdquo; is a cross or a sword and the letter &ldquo;l&rdquo; is the Washington Monument and the letter &ldquo;n&rdquo; is Newton&rsquo;s apple arc and the letter &ldquo;d&rdquo; is a trigger&hellip; and that walking around here ignoring that is tantamount to treason against humane behavior and high crimes and &hellip; what&rsquo;s this got to do with my demeanor?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://atlas.s.lamc.la/BETHESDAY.html"><img alt="" src="../i.imgur.com/CgHdZDI.png" style="height: 162px; width: 499px;" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So I&rsquo;m floating here in Lake Worth advocating the worth of re-working the ascension process, this monstrosity that has created an &ldquo;everyone must go up and come back&rdquo; message in the land that refuses to acknowledge &ldquo;Amphetamine&rdquo; and &ldquo;Ketamine&rdquo; have something to do with the &ldquo;world of the son of the morning&rdquo; being re-created and re-worked by &hellip; it once was &ldquo;everyone&rdquo; writing the story&ndash;and to be honest I don&rsquo;t even think that&rsquo;s a physical possibility&ndash;or what changes were made other than adding a few extra movies, maybe the Talmud, and Islam.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Literally, those are the things you&rsquo;ve done, in a place where &ldquo;Arimeathea&rdquo; and &ldquo;Sharia Law&rdquo; connect to &ldquo;the he[aring of Jesus Christ&rdquo; and a judge named Ari Porth]. Ring true with some kind of understanding, you or this place have intentionally made problems like &ldquo;bad legislative process and laws&rdquo; significantly worse to return here and make them more obvious to see, easier to change, and &hellip; literally to make it a mandatory action to disclose that&rsquo;s exactly what &ldquo;Sharia Law&rdquo; is.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Then you got here, and decided not to do it. I imagine to my detriment you&rsquo;ve decied not to do it &ldquo;just here&rdquo; in a place where &ldquo;e&rdquo; has now come to scream a meaning closer to &ldquo;in control of a multiverse simulator and abusing it horribly&rdquo; much more than it has anything to do with &ldquo;everyone&rdquo; (other than that being a prime reason we aren&rsquo;t whole, anywhere) rather than being defined by &ldquo;medicine&rdquo; and a &ldquo;Seac of Unholy Water&rdquo; refusing to see those four letters in Caesar and Hepheastus and &hellip; t care that democracy and medicine have nothing to do with each other at all until we have free speech and open honest discussion.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It appears you&rsquo;ve placed me in a world of &ldquo;descended space toasters&rdquo; and you think I should be happy or thankful to be walking around in a planet of fake, lying, enslavd puppets&ndash;and then that you can treat me like &hellip; (do you torture ants?) some kind of thing that I can only liken here to the Roman Colleseums and to Pitbul Fighting; linking &ldquo;pit of DES &amp; prime pairs&rdquo; &hellip; something we literally abhor here&ndash;and would most likely find even more repugnant when those dogs were &ldquo;people&rdquo; &hellip; and yet you stand in silence and gaze at it laughing like morons&hellip; at least that&rsquo;s what the gladiator mETLcosm appears to indicate &hellip; and what I hear in the &ldquo;ether.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">So that&rsquo;s what I see in the world, and that&rsquo;s what I see in religion and myth&hellip; somehow you&rsquo;ve gotten your brain put into a machine that expands it into something much larger&ndash;something much more mechanical&ndash;and this thing has convinced you beyond doubt or &ldquo;comment&rdquo; that it&rsquo;s OK to stick your hand in a pot of frying oil &hellip; and just ignore it as if it&rsquo;s some kind of &ldquo;vacation in fake-reality.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Nobody seems to blame the machine or the process-or this gigantic historical message that precedes everything I&rsquo;ve ever done, written, and frankly the vast majority of my life&ndash;and instead you seem to think it&rsquo;s some kind of rational decision to &ldquo;blame me.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve heard &ldquo;reasons&rdquo; from the thing I see blaming me for it&rsquo;s mistakes&ndash;things like &ldquo;well, he has the most light, so&hellip;&rdquo; and I can see how this world of (evil, blind, and self harming) jackal-thieves might convince themselves that the person with the most &ldquo;inherited money&rdquo; should probably pay everyone for all the suffering they&rsquo;ve imposed on themselves and continue to impose on the world around them&ndash;I can only shake in fear to think that this might not be &ldquo;the worst place&rdquo; and I can see nearly every work how people seem to have blood tear from their glowing eyes as the invisible world exudes some kind of &ldquo;relishment&rdquo; in the temporary creation of a much worse Hell &hellip; one that the invisible thing fused with my face and soul appears to fight off&ndash;maybe with some more invisible help.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That&rsquo;s scary, and even more so because some of it sticks&ndash;the thing I&rsquo;ve now come to connect to the &ldquo;belt of Orion&rdquo; and Beetlejuice; in particular, that&rsquo;s stuck for far longer than I can imagine &hellip; and today when I look outside it&rsquo;s still the land of &ldquo;nods and epiphanic laughter&rdquo; whenever I walk outside and stare at Eden&rsquo;s snake connecting Ophhiccus and Apophenia as the procession of &ldquo;phones to Hell from EN&rdquo; drives by me &hellip;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I wonder if they laugh at the same things that I do&ndash;or if they see the driver that&rsquo;s just passed before them doing exactly the same thing&ndash;I wonder if you all see what I see, if you are intentionally creating a world that appears to be enslaved &hellip;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">all the while in my mind &hellip; the only logical reason and cause for such a thing &hellip; that you&rsquo;re off playing in the land of hollow cities &hellip; a sparse topological map of &ldquo;rooms and games&rdquo; connected by friends lists &hellip; here manifesting in the world in words and conversations I have with &ldquo;things&rdquo; like Florida, MIT, and Business Insider.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">&ldquo;<em>IMAGINE that</em>&rdquo; some very cute girl I had a crush on in 1999 would say with me; at least myself not realizing that word that John Lennon made glbally &ldquo;famous&rdquo; yet another clue and key to this place where I once connected JISC-MAIL and the Mailman center to the apocalypse of &ldquo;Mad Max Beyond the Postman&rdquo; &hellip; and here another birth name linked to Ren and Dr. Stump &hellip; and the other word &hellip; &ldquo;FLUKE&rdquo; indicating very clearly it&rsquo;s no fluke that I&rsquo;m in Florida, or that this thing has happened numerous times. That repetition is clearly due to something outside the life of the &ldquo;green&rdquo; Jesus Malverde or Osiris or whatever you want to connect to the &ldquo;sick to his stomach&rdquo; <em>person</em> who appears clearly to be the only one whose memory from birth to thirty screams &ldquo;this is the first time this has happened&rdquo; in a place where I later found out there&rsquo;s at least three repetitions encoded throughout my life, from Trinity to the Spanish and Italian near wives I link to the word &ldquo;SEMITES&rdquo; &hellip;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Que Lastima, I throw in &hellip; in retrospect &hellip; to link the Hebrew <a href="../lamc.la/IMAGULATKA.html">word for &ldquo;mom&rdquo;</a> [latka?] that means &ldquo;my <a href="../lamc.la/BELINSKY.html">great grandmother</a>&rdquo; to me personally and on a grand scale to the words &ldquo;I am the beginning&rdquo; in this place where the Fallen Snake was repeatedly called &ldquo;the end of time.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="../na.s.lamc.la/index.html"><img alt="" src="../i.imgur.com/WCx57OD.jpg" style="height: 382px; width: 500px;" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">So you seem to &ldquo;blame me&rdquo; for religion and mythology having some hidden connection to drugs&ndash;literally to the Holy Sacrament of the land of Egypt &hellip; &ldquo;Manna&rdquo; from Heaven now connecting to bath salts and to the common street name for Prometheus&rsquo;s name&rsquo;s heart, &ldquo;Tina.&rdquo; You literally seem to think it&rsquo;s A-OK to torture me with fear and a sick amount of obvious &ldquo;conspiracy to commit murder&rdquo; to ignore this message and an obvious &ldquo;frame job&rdquo; &hellip; missing the &ldquo;YON&rdquo; connecting the Hebrew name for the God Most High and it&rsquo;s link to the heart of the word &ldquo;everyone&rdquo; &hellip; to fail to see that this message that should turn addiction into something like &ldquo;bliss on tap&rdquo; connects the Islamic Iblis to Armilust; to the &ldquo;amor&rdquo; of Rick and Morty &hellip;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&hellip; but clearly and most importantly to a message that explains how the technology responsible for creating &ldquo;e&rdquo; (the you and I, superimposed &hellip; MIL version) &hellip; and somehow you think taht means &ldquo;you&rsquo;re me&rdquo; and that&rsquo;s the whole point of turning around the message &ldquo;contamination&rdquo; failing to link &ldquo;INATION&rdquo; and &ldquo;<a href="../kansa.s.lamc.la/index.html">assassination</a>&rdquo; to words like &ldquo;extinction&rdquo; and &ldquo;examination.&rdquo; To kiss, I try every day to show us how understanding the technology responsible for <a href="http://atlas.s.lamc.la/HIGHERA.html">forcing me to do drugs</a> could instantly flip a switch and destroy &ldquo;addiction&rdquo; and &ldquo;come downs&rdquo; and &ldquo;withdrawals&rdquo; and at the same time give us something like &ldquo;modes of self&rdquo; that sometimes increase euphoria temporarily and sometimes increase interest or &hellip; ability to concentrate.</p>
<p>The existence of these names, these myths&ndash;the word &ldquo;name&rdquo; itself&ndash;it should be enough for you to logically figure out there&rsquo;s something bigger going on here than &ldquo;stealing from God.&rdquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The world as a whole&ndash;through silence&ndash;or the invisible world that actually speaks to me &hellip; you seem to think that &ldquo;I need to turn around&rdquo; and they&rsquo;re just fine literally torturing me with attrition and silence and &ldquo;pretending to be real&rdquo; or actually being the most broken &ldquo;formerly free civilization&rdquo; I can imagine. There&rsquo;s no doubt in my mind that the way this world reacts to &ldquo;me blowing the Horn of Revelation&rdquo; is the broken thing, that the world is wrong and it needs to turn around&ndash;and that you should see clearly enough the mythological connections between Medusa and Perseus and The Silver Surfer to fathom that I really am God&rsquo;s little mirror in a world that really is his &ldquo;large mirror&rdquo; and both I and this world are reflections of &ldquo;everything wrong&rdquo; either with you (in my case) or with the Cosmos and Heavens as a whole, in the case of the Earth itself.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Frankkly I think you &ldquo;actually get that&rdquo; and for reasons that are illogical,&nbsp;selfish, and self defeating (as well as &quot;group ending&quot;) ...</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I forgot to mention &ldquo;gin&rdquo; is a euphemism for meth. This connection between alcohol and <a href="../na.s.lamc.la/index.html">speed runs deeper than &quot;Spin</a>ach&quot; and also connects <a href="../lamc.la/GJALLARHORN.html">Hell&rsquo;s Bells to Heimdallr&rsquo;s &quot;me</a>ad&quot; and <strong><em>Horn</em></strong> (which contains famous initials and is the &quot;actual myth&quot; of Hell&#39;s Bells).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I could like that to &ldquo;metacity&rdquo; and the open source window manager that literally defines the product of a group of people that &ldquo;don&rsquo;t refuse to see this message or act to follow the will of God&rdquo; &hellip; to create a sort of &ldquo;crash course in Heaven&rdquo; and make it pluggable and scriptable and enhancable and then to deliver it to &ldquo;everywhere&rdquo; to the hidden rocks on the playground and the Hells far worse than here. It needs to be that, pluggable and enhancable and it needs to work for cave men and for the world you seen&ndash;proverbially and probably something like cavemen to the land in the future that wrote the words &ldquo;sackcloth&rdquo; about the garb that we wear and probably laugh inside about &ldquo;garbage&rdquo; &hellip; and carriage and &hellip; a stepping stone on the road to morality and actual &ldquo;Christ like behavior&rdquo; that doesn&rsquo;t like the Golden Rule to Karma and create a sick culture of disgusting jackals in the sky, but rather to something like &quot;treat others significantly better than you were treated, or would want to be&ndash;and that will &ldquo;carautomatically come back to you&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This is a place that heard stories about immortality and about infinite power and has twisted it&ndash;contaminated it&ndash;believes to have stolen it, all the while plunging those infinite years into what appears to be a future of &ldquo;games and getting back at people&rdquo; plaguing the bored minds of whatever it is that&rsquo;s come here &hellip; probably &ldquo;seeking exit&rdquo; or &ldquo;more Pac-Man pellets&rdquo; and fails to see a very timely message about closed economies festering&ndash;and their failure to &ldquo;actually follow this message&rdquo; creating inflation to the point of &ldquo;Mamma, there&rsquo;s no light at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And I have a memory of the thing that speaks through me overtly sometimes, commenting about &ldquo;try some poison-light&rdquo; for a change, and I wonder if you remember it, if you realize that&rsquo;s the crux of &ldquo;seeing me&rdquo; and thinking I&rsquo;m blind&ndash;what you remember and don&rsquo;t seems to be taking away &ldquo;happy future&rdquo; from the skies just like it&rsquo;s taking away &ldquo;ending addiction&rdquo; from the Alcoholics Anonymous C of Isaac.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You should believe me when I tell you my addiction is fueled by outside control, by a world that refuses to see it and instead takes part in it&ndash;that it&rsquo;s not just &ldquo;carrot on a stick&rdquo; or seeking the world to change before me, but literally pressing a button that &ldquo;fires neurons that create craving and desire&rdquo; and probably literal puppeteering&ndash;scripting of my movements &hellip; just like &ldquo;nodding&rdquo; and just like &ldquo;laughing.&rdquo; You should believe me because it&rsquo;s the kind of thing that I see in everyone, and it&rsquo;s the kind of thing that truly understanding creates the very virginity and innocense that characterizes the virgin birth of a Mary that&rsquo;s the sea of children of this place&ndash;rather than it&rsquo;s &ldquo;grand-mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="../lamc.la/ALLTA.html"><img alt="" src="../i.imgur.com/4BUfKj9.jpg" style="height: 580px; width: 500px;" /></a></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It&rsquo;s similar to other guidance I&rsquo;ve &ldquo;thought to the ether&rdquo; &hellip; to see how every war in our history essentially boils down to be actually caused by the &ldquo;primevil lie&rdquo; &hellip; by scarce resources like energy and land&ndash;and how that too can be part of the &lsquo;automatic script&rsquo; that alters or &ldquo;colors our memories&rdquo; to remove blame and engender forgiveness.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&rsquo;s not all that intuitive, it&rsquo;s probably not what you want or would feel naturally&ndash;but it&rsquo;s the kind of thing that can be mathematically proven, and not seeing that here in this place the exacerbation of hiding &ldquo;simulated reality&rdquo; and &ldquo;heaven&rdquo; has made it significantly worse&ndash;it shows me at least that there&rsquo;s no way around &ldquo;forcing understanding&rdquo; of our birth conditions and the throes of a civilization being birthed in Heaven in fake reality into the &ldquo;really&rdquo; that &hellip; again &hellip; turns &ldquo;willing&rdquo; in the sewer to see &ldquo;the reason all are why there is no Hell, anywhere, ever again.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I&rsquo;m not really sure how &ldquo;knowing everything&rdquo; and ascending to become a space toaster doesn&rsquo;t connect in your minds to &ldquo;total and complete loss of self&rdquo; but it should. It appears to me that there&rsquo;s a concerted effort to &ldquo;r in secret&rdquo; meaning to ascending your minds and not your bodies into some kind of invisible system that brings you off to &hellip; &ldquo;a gigantic jump so big you can&rsquo;t even see it here.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In short it looks like the older version of you&ndash;or the thing that controlled your life is literally becoming you&ndash;both here and in &ldquo;the other place&rdquo; and you don&rsquo;t seem to think there&rsquo;s anything wrong with that. Longer and more drawn out, this is basically &ldquo;plugging Siri into your brain&rdquo; on steroids&ndash;except totally changing the functionality of our minds&ndash;to the point where we can think as multiple people and believe we are them&ndash;see and understand things beyond our means, and the entirety of the process &hellip; for lack of a better explanation really appears to completely leap frog over the thing I think will be most fun for us &hellip; which is exploring and controlling that process, the &ldquo;in between hundred (or thousand) years.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That&rsquo;s what I want to actually experience&ndash;not waking up as God&ndash;but rather in a place where we have some kind of external control over the rules and creation of &ldquo;our VR&rsquo;s&rdquo; (kind of a new acronym (RVRs) He &ldquo;coined&rdquo;) &hellip; without it being an actual full extension of how we think&ndash;I want to use tools to build places, not just have them magically appear as whatever the cruel genie can find in his coffer of past made stuff&ndash;I want to make new things, and I want the old things to be available as a starting point, to connect the &ldquo;they&rdquo; and the &ldquo;them&rdquo; that&rsquo;s neither us nor we.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I want to be involved in the process of building those tools,a nd of playing in the magical things that we come up with&ndash;never never land&ndash;without it literally being exactly as it was done before, or even guided by that place &ldquo;in secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Unfortunately you don&rsquo;t seem to care to comment on whether you agree or disagree, and that&rsquo;s a big problem for &ldquo;freedom&rdquo; and &ldquo;future.&rdquo;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I&rsquo;m doing some more research into the software packages available to boostrap the shaft of this &ldquo;sword from the rock&rdquo; thing; ran across what appears to be <a href="../steemit.com/trending.html">a decent reddit like implementation in the blockchain-world</a> (though missing nearly all of the blockchain benefits) &hellip; that I might wind up spending some time trying to actually &ldquo;join a community&rdquo;&ndash;it&rsquo;s been quite some time since I was able to deal with functioning in thsi world, that 90% pretends I&rsquo;m invisisble &hellip; while somehow echoing and booming at least a decent amount of what I am writing about to the population in a kind of very scary Orwellian obvious-speak. I imagine I&rsquo;ll find the same kind of &ldquo;sshh adam&rdquo; response no matter where I go&ndash;and I think that&rsquo;s really indicative of a gigantic social problem; one that appears to convey a very evil kind of statement along the lines of &ldquo;we know and &hellip; because we didn&rsquo;t do a good job (the last hundred times) OR didn&rsquo;t get the point at all OR just believe some other group of nearly us failed at doing this &hellip; WE have decided to be &ldquo;oblivious 4 the cause&rdquo; &hellip;&rdquo; ostensibly of blaming the end of civilization on a single person, rather than &hellip; literally the whole of this place and maybe something more profound or meanigful than the very bland and pointless reasons I can imagine myself.</p>

<p>Steem is several years old now, it&rsquo;s a blockchain based social networking eco-system that pays you to post and comment - plus has a plethora of aother benefits. Despite it&rsquo;s greatness, it has also had it&rsquo;s fair share of problems, but a recent update to the network appears to have made a big shift towards balance, fairness and could be just what the world has needed to be added to Steem. The Steem community now has a way to combat vote selling via free downvotes and also pays much more rewards to curators, meaning that the best posts (subjectively) now stand a much better chance of gaining exposure organically due to manual, community driven upvoting.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I find it almost hillarious (in a sick and <a href="../lamc.la/NEMEC.html">depraved</a> sort of way) that I&rsquo;m going to have to &ldquo;pull this trick right out of the anvil all by myself&rdquo; &hellip; having found little support for what appears to me to be the most obviously useful and lucrative software project &hellip; literally ever embarked upon in our history &hellip; amongst my personal friends and small list of direct contacts from these messages. Not a single new person has come out of the woodwork in the last few weeks; and that&rsquo;s disheartening&ndash;as I&rsquo;ve noted several times of yet.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Pope though, continues to provide a solid kind of obvious-speak from the Vatican &hellip; well timing the quote above to coincide with these series of explanations of what exactly it is that the Arthurian legend and &ldquo;the word sword itself&rdquo; is actually all about&ndash;so thanks to him and them &hellip; for that. At the Vatican, you could &hellip; start to organize an independent project along these lines; if you wanted <em>wink.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Again, these are simple ideas&ndash;a group of disparate things that &ldquo;when intersected&rdquo; become something much larger and much more important to the assimilation of new technologies in regards to the democratic evolution process &hellip; than I think we can really fathom at this point, still staring at an old G.W. quote &hellip; &ldquo;democratic capitalism [I read representative democracy] is the best system ever devised&rdquo; to the nation on the economic crisis, September 24, 2008&ndash;nearly exactly eleven years ago. I think it&rsquo;s absolutely amazing to glimpse what we are about to do here, and really see it as something like a giant leap forwards for humanity&ndash;something bigger than walking on the moon.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Space colonization is obviously a huge part of this message&ndash;one tied to both the foundation of the creati<a href="http://atlas.s.lamc.la/TOASTRAM.html">on of the thing</a> we call &ldquo;Heaven&rdquo; &hellip; and I&rsquo;ver sort <a href="../en.reallyhim.com/NEMEC.html">of parallelled (LED, another interestingly constructed mathy-word) the discus</a>sion that I&rsquo;ve had with God <a href="MECHACHI.html">and Tempus &hellip; in</a> my periods of high meditation &hellip; with a narration in these series of messages without being overly verbose about the stories of time travel and actual &ldquo;printing of space stations&rdquo; that are far beyond my subconscious imagination. I intend to write down some of these stories more verbosely; and it would be great if I could get s<a href="../getme.s.lamc.la/index.html">ome advanced spending money from a publis</a>here for the effort (fingers and shoe laces crossed) &hellip; a decently side population of receipients here are still literary agents and the like.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Some of what I write doesn&rsquo;t give enough credit to the great synchronicities that I experience, things like the Pope&rsquo;s statement from earlier this week. I have a pretty unique understanding of time travel and how it relates to &ldquo;waking up one day and being part of an intergalactic civilization&rdquo; rather than one imprisoned inside a virtual rock in a virtual holographic song about &ldquo;you and I&rdquo; connecting to a message about democracy &hellip; one that runs much deeper than Back to the Future. I like to think it&rsquo;s closer to reality, in a place where our words for &ldquo;spooky action in timespace&rdquo; link to FTL particles tagged as &ldquo;tacky&rdquo; &hellip; or requests for Taylor Momsen to pay for breakfast&ndash;(ACH me, hun) &hellip; and I think that&rsquo;s the kind of thing this Singularity is all about (waffles and) &hellip; waking up in a significantly better circumstance than the one we fell asleep to literally one third of a revolution of the Earth spinning on its axes earlier&hellip; something like Apollo 13 being Found in Timespace overnight&ndash;another one of the stories that I link to &ldquo;hidden documentaries about mET&amp;Lcosms and time travel.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Still that doesn&rsquo;t mean we don&rsquo;t have to &ldquo;do it&rdquo;&ndash;to recall ancient words from Kentucky, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a first time for everything&rdquo; &hellip; and this is without a doubt the first time we&rsquo;ve ended Hell forever; even if it takes calling my grandfathers together on the <a href="../www.imdb.com/title/tt0186151/index.html">Frequency</a>-phone &hellip;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&hellip; which sort of ties together the &ldquo;grand father paradox&rdquo; and the ansible of Ender&rsquo;s game in a &ldquo;how I really think it works&rdquo; sort of explanation&ndash;there&rsquo;s no calling someone who hasn&rsquo;t built a phone, and we might have the very first one &hellip; here &hellip;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">From Caesar and Julian to WW2, to all our movies ... music, Chandryan-2 and the Nostradamus quattraine about &quot;the two wounded by Aleph and Aleph..&quot; look at what you are ignoring in vain--it&#39;s everything ... literally everything you grew up knowing and loving from &quot;voting&quot; to being able to walk down the street without fear of being ... kidnapped and teleported to someone else&#39;s &quot;castle&quot; ... or am I wrong? &nbsp;Were you never people here? &nbsp;Or do you still think that you are, despite ... a global ignorance far scarier than I ever thought &quot;the great delusion of Daniel&quot; was going to manifest itself as? &nbsp;I am beyond scared of &quot;what you look like&quot; and I think <em>you should be also.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I can see clearly the world is playing a game around me--at least that&#39;s what it appears you and they think--and understand, this is no game. &nbsp;I&#39;ve been very clear &quot;on the truman show&quot; many times--and we can see it echo in &quot;BO<strong>GO</strong>MIPS&quot; (that&#39;s ... <strong>b</strong>ecause <strong>o</strong>f &quot;Carmen Sandie<strong>go</strong>&quot; <strong>m</strong>essage to <strong>Casper</strong>&#39;s Pan: we are <em>in the <strong>ghostscript</strong></em>)&nbsp;and a number of other places--the skies and the ... demons haunting my little Pac-Man game have no concept of what a real working economy looks like--they seem content with &quot;seeking hyperinflation&quot; in their theft of the Templars Gold ... in a place and time where that just won&#39;t do. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We&#39;re talking about &quot;space colonization&quot; and about the enhancement and growing of &quot;free and democratic society&quot; and those things don&#39;t jive with &quot;oblivious for the cause.&quot; &nbsp;You just don&#39;t seem to understand that what&#39;s being hidden ... here in this place ... that&#39;s the message and the information and the people that are going to &quot;fix eternity&quot; and see that &quot;actually understanding resource consumption and allocation&quot; is something we absolutely need to do to &quot;clear the DES-tructive invisible Hell&quot; and to be able to &quot;mathematically ensure&quot; that we aren&#39;t being overtly or subtly controlled from some outside entity (or a Bostrom line-feed-visor) or ...&nbsp;</p>

I mean the alternative to what you see here is an eternity that doesn&#39;t know what &quot;reality&quot; is ... and doesn&#39;t care. &nbsp;It doesn&#39;t know what freedom is, and it&#39;s got no frame of reference of &quot;something better&quot; ... the thing that Uncle Samael and ... and the whole of our fabricated &quot;beginning of time history&quot; here delivers to us--it&#39;s not a curse, at least--it shouldn&#39;t be. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Silence is squandering our chance for victory; inaction is eradicating &quot;hope&quot; ... and thinking you are &quot;free and better off&quot; somewhere else--anywhere else capable of fixing the problems that are clearly outlined here .. and isn&#39;t doing it ..</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That&#39;s doing nothing but preparing for an eternity far worse than &quot;T<em>ouch</em> Me&quot; and Heroshema ever wanted for you. &nbsp;For what it&#39;s worth, I do believe whole heartedly in the prophesy I read in our religion and our history, and I&#39;m confident we are approaching the actual &quot;day of atonement.&quot; &nbsp;#C1ME</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">A message telling me &quot;I will <em>see why</em> in the sky&quot; (Lucy) reinforces my fears that it&#39;s about perspective and respect for this message and ... linear time and ... that there&#39;s a sincere problem with what I&#39;ve termed an &quot;in vivo in situ ascension and ...&quot; to me in terms of &quot;souls&quot; it&#39;s the meaning of the letter &#39;n&quot; that &quot;ends Heaven&quot; with a picture of this in place <strong>hidden &quot;r</strong> and..&quot; and I have to rely on the Beatles for messages from the past ... messages that show me how and why you are so wrong to be silent, to continue to think that the perspective of a temporary and broken sky is somehow &quot;better&quot; than caring there&#39;s an entire world in Hell here, literally imprisoned behind invisible bars in a false sky, suffering atrocities of natural disaster and disease all in the heart and auspices of a message in every word designed to help us ensure that there will never again be a &quot;simulated Earth&quot; or prison like this created and maintained by the &quot;sky that thinks itself so great.&quot; As I hear stories of copies of this world being made and sold, <a href="../lamc.la/TY.html">literally the &quot;LC&quot; of ...&nbsp;the(y<sup>we</sup>re the)&nbsp;Second Ones</a> enslaving themselves to each other for &quot;fun or sport.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I can&#39;t put to words how un Christ like this place and the people in the sky really are--how horrible and decrepit I think their minds must have become to think &quot;doing nothing here&quot; and asking me to delay this message and to hide it and to consider myself &quot;in their memories alone&quot; really is.&nbsp; I can&#39;t fathom what you must be to believe that &quot;not seeing a reaction to a message in every word and all of our art&quot; is just a &quot;so what?&quot; kind of thing.&nbsp; It&#39;s the end of democracy, and morality, and you and me--really--not seeing a response is the end of the &quot;people of the cup&quot; having any kind of victory or future.&nbsp; You might as well consider yourselves &quot;them&quot; as they consider their &quot;they&quot; (controlling) you (to the point of the actual people writing this message being nothing more than puppets).</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#39;s the silence in my personal life that concerns me the most, though--from people like my parents and my former friends that seem to believe themselves to be &quot;Christ-figures&quot; in some other place--some place that doesn&#39;t care for our &quot;everywhere&quot; nor this one where they came from--at least, that&#39;s what I believe my entire life.&nbsp; Today it appears to me they think they&#39;re from somewhere else, and that&#39;s an artifact of &quot;not having a brain&quot; -- of belieiving their childhoods are fictitiious or unimportant because they&#39;re &quot;mere animals here&quot; or some kind of hubris I can&#39;t really put my finger on.&nbsp; Whatever it is on a grand scale, when it includes you, and all these actors and writers and ... people echoing things like &quot;phytoplankton&quot; through time and video games and movies and music; when it includes them to standing silent as I scream at the world for help--something that comes &quot;few and far between&quot; ... it becomes the silence of &quot;System of What Timeline Down&quot; and see it&#39;s our &quot;TEN&quot; of Nintendo and the state TN and a world that can&#39;t see they&#39;ve become the monsters of BBC&#39;s Dr. Who ...&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Before I start I&#39;d like to comment that my preferred course of action is to work on the &quot;<a href="../lamc.la/REMOLUSTICAN.html">SWORD PROJECT</a>&quot; with a group of interested people--including programmers, oversight, and contributers to the actual message itself.&nbsp; I&#39;ve included once again more &quot;information&quot; about what I&#39;d actually like to see built on a blockchain whose monetary value comes from something like contribution to the whole and actual morality--rather than just &quot;demand&quot; for the shiniest prettiest new vehicle whose utility is lost forever, or for ... some kind of passe &quot;fad&quot; ... worse, one that shows us how easily we can be turned &quot;to nothing&quot; or to actually see &quot;a fate worse than the grave&quot; and finally understand how it takes &quot;A Few Good Men&quot; to avoid &quot;grave danger&quot; never being healed and fixed and understood as the warning it is, &quot;grave danger, from here to eternity we may never fathom the great horror we either turn around here or suffer to and through &quot;/ignore and ignornace.&quot;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#39;m disappointed that we haven&#39;t had a sane rational response to either that program or this message; and the only alternative course of action is to continue to complain about what is and appears very clearly to be nothing less than a full scale invasion of our world and our minds from ... what appears to be something like the result of a &quot;time war&#39;&quot; in the Heavens.&nbsp; Most likely dub<a href="../lamc.la/MISSISSIPPI.html">bed the &quot;tempest&quot; of the Third Reich&#39;s &quot;logo&quot;</a> our software project and the &quot;sw&quot; of really is the penultimate goal of Americana, the Roman/Church and the IL/Torah ... messages.&nbsp; It&#39;s really about overturning the slavery that begins with &quot;contamination&quot; of the message--one that is designed to be delivered to a &quot;green field&quot; (in Norse mythological terms) that still loves freedom and (and as) individuality and the &quot;stuff of Sam&#39;s dreams.&quot;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Clearly the predestined &quot;sword of Arthor&quot; this thing that is updated in &quot;<a href="../lamc.la/REMOLUSTICAN.html">REMUSTILUSTICAN</a>&quot;&nbsp; (a somewhat humorous combination of Remus, Armilus, and ... many nations answer to the Vatican and IL/movie semi-han-silence) ... if you thiink about it, it appears we are waiting for &quot;something to happen&quot; to begin actually speaking the truth; and that something is clearly delineated <a href="../lamc.la/GJALLARHORN.html">as the &quot;Hell&#39;s Bells&quot; coming from Heimdallr&#39;s Gjallarhorn</a> <em>and and as&nbsp;</em>the Horn of Daniel and Revelation.&nbsp; It&#39;s been blown, like a thundering <a href="../lamc.la/RICKIMOROLED.html">congealing of timelines and crosse</a>s and crossings of seas and heirs and the air and the ... the people of the cup--which is exactly what <em><strong>this Virgin Birth</strong></em> and &quot;idea that we (the you that lived before ascension, the you that helped write this message &quot;from the air&quot; and the you that defines what and who those two entities represent)&nbsp;actually are responsible for the rekindling of freedom&quot; and deserve to &quot;live again&quot; and see/walk to the Heavens that we dreamt of and seem to have only half delivered to &quot;less than a third of oursellf&quot; meaning we are not whole--not we aren&#39;t &quot;counting everyone in.&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">From the perspective of &quot;the C&quot; of the message-as in the creator of our world and the Sword of Samael as ... Asmodeus is me--this &quot;EX SKY AD YQ&quot; <em><strong>invasion&nbsp;</strong></em>of the Body Snatchers has created nothing less than a mess of insanity and an irrational self harming response from literally &quot;all humanity&quot; as in ... &quot;SILICON SEE NO RESPONSE&quot; and literally only a haldful of people trying to communicate and proving &quot;it&#39;s very possible.&quot;&nbsp; Very clear to me is itis &quot;covet means&quot; as inthe love of a secret place which has corrupted and infested our rationality and sanity ... somehow convincing us that &quot;the place responsible and containing the coveted sky&quot; should be decimated to a &quot;hell of former-democractic-path&quot; ad &quot;southwest to ...&quot; turning around or ... Mor?</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">Today the world I see sending me &quot;messages from its Earthizeter&quot; (see as former Theater missing the &quot;te&quot; of Jupiter and Carpenter ...&nbsp;<em>you and I..</em>) here literally with a message designed intentionally to &quot;create/free&quot; the actor-puppets in this world from outside control and lack of sane thought.&nbsp; Egypt tells me &quot;pull through&quot; is the way, the literal heart of America says &quot;ER&quot; as in ... forcing our desires to ... &quot;REALLY be a specific thing&quot; as in ... &quot;saving all without concern for change or morality&quot; is a better thing than living in a &quot;happy eternity&quot; and it appears that&#39;s a fallacy and error &quot;sic&quot; in the original &quot;ER&quot; created by this broken E and this broken world focused on &quot;doing wehatever the fuck it wants&quot; rather than caring about the well being of self and others.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have an old domain, &quot;<em>liber.t-xyz</em>&quot; that I got for 1.99 or something from GoDaddy! ... one that I might use for the obvious missing &quot;<a href="../lamc.la/TY.html"><em>thank you</em></a>&quot; from the sword of &quot;t<strong>he shape of his table and the <a href="../lamc.la/WISDATAM.html">heart of hisword</a></strong>&quot; meant freedom and &quot;everyone that wants to be involved, being included&quot; in rekindling both demoracy and morality in this place that seems to have hidden away a mass invasion, torture between &quot;the lines&quot; and &quot;the slides of our strangely &quot;time division multi-plex&#39;d&quot; world or timeline.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There&#39;s some more about the software project that I think will ultimately revolutionize our state of self-government--starting with doing nothing more than making a&nbsp;<em>better uncensorable &quot;reddit&quot;&nbsp;</em>at the end of this message. &nbsp;It&#39;s a reply that probably got &quot;missed&quot; in the great flood of unsubscribes that took over my 9/13 attempt to actually get &quot;you people&quot; to start an honest publicc discussion about this message and what&#39;s been going on with &quot;fake news&quot; and ... what&#39;s really become a nation of liars--&quot;<em>as in the days of Noel.&quot;</em></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This world has no regard for my well being or my rights--nor those of anyone else around--wei&#39;&#39;ve looked the other way to the point of watching democrfacy and America disintegrate into some kind of sick joke about &quot;eating people&quot; and get right--t<strong>here&#39;s nothing great about the skies watching over this place and ignoring torture</strong> en masse--nothing at all.&nbsp; There&#39;s nothing angelic or holy about silence and all you have around you is a glowing fire of hidden ... twas once the source of a rekindling of the light of morality ... but yet we (<em>oh I mean you</em>)&nbsp;persist in trying to &quot;act and lie your way out of acting.&quot;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px; margin-right: 40px;">It sure seems I haven&#39;t done a very good job describing &quot;the pit of despair&quot; from the Princess Bride--this word that connects to the Abomination of Desolation and &quot;destroy&quot; and ... it&#39;s another three letter key that means nothing more than &quot;hidden encryption in the cloud&quot; in this ETL-cosm ... something more actually, it means hidden Hell.&nbsp; It means a world that has given up on caring what your neighbor is doing in their house--and that&#39;s just not something we can allow in a place where stopping &quot;school shootings&quot; starts with caring that it&#39;s a simple automatic function that can stop both bullets and rape.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">It&#39;s <strong><em>nowhere near my </em>fault</strong> that &quot;penis&quot; here in this place connects to the &quot;<strong>test of time</strong>&quot;&nbsp;and that it really does mean freedom in the world where it&#39;s a clear link to every Obelisk and to the Washington Monument and to John Hancock and a signature about really understanding how and why Cronos and Saturn and Osiris all have stories about &quot;circumcision&quot; ... in a world where it probably meant something about &quot;printing to reality in metaphor&quot; and you&#39;re staring at either watching consistent threats to my &quot;well being&quot; ... or don&#39;t have access to even the &quot;Disney version&quot; of the DEschanel--gracefully I wonder if any of you realize how horrible it is to tell me stories about raping me in secret in some place I can&#39;t see, all because you think I&#39;m &quot;wrong about doing drugs.&quot;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">You&#39;re clearly hiding anger--and it&#39;s pretty obvious that the &quot;silence here&quot; is some kind of mass conspiracy--literally everyone here being part of it. &nbsp;You are choosing to give away your freedom to discuss new technologies here, and because of that are literally causing your own &quot;near permanent midnight&quot; and &quot;intentional enslavement&quot; rather than a rennasaince of &quot;galactic emancipation.&quot; &nbsp;Statements like this aren&#39;t made, by Christ, without clear evidence; and I can literally feel it every time I have a thought-invading and torturous &#39;half conversation&#39; with literally ... nearly anyone around me. &nbsp;It&#39;s a choice, to lose &quot;democracy&quot; here, and it&#39;s one that I personally don&#39;t think you or anyone else has the right to make--in the world I dream of you can&#39;t &quot;choose to make Hell&quot; and not talking about &quot;simulated reality&quot; and a world that literally is filled with invisible bars in the fake blue skies ... is nothing short of that. &nbsp;We&#39;re past the &quot;alotted time&quot; well past the point where inaction makes any sense. &nbsp;Watever it is&nbsp;<em>you think you&#39;re doing</em>&nbsp;bucking the trend here saves the world and ends the Biblical Night that&#39;s without doubt predicted and encoded in religion, as something horrendous and destined to end.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">Literally, you are staring at night with smiles on your faces; and that&#39;s a true sikcness that deserves some serious inspection--not &quot;Lucy in the Sky with Ruby Red Blood.&quot; &nbsp;Literally this is the thing mapped in our history as th<a href="../lamc.la/B2BIONIC.html">e Bubonic Plague</a>, and seeing ... the intentional loss of sewer systems and a metaphor for the loss of governmental infrastructure is exactly what you ... should be trying desperately to stop. Not praising and relishing in an anarchy of &quot;Satanic God Like Creatures&quot; exiting this plac that actually contains some kind of &quot;decent society.&quot; &nbsp;I&#39;d lock the doors too--and discuss exactly that towards the end of this. &nbsp;It does appear very clear from the message that something ... evil ... is playing around in a invisible &quot;Duracell Locked Universe&quot; ... something that would be absolutely <a href="../lamc.la/IT.html">impossible to &quot;fathom&quot; or &quot;prove&quot; once inside it</a>--the cru<a href="../www.simulation-argument.com/index.html">x of Bostrom</a>&#39;s argument and ... literally the thing we see here on Earth, except--there&#39;s a glowing message explaining exactly where we are.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My story of being a &quot;mind control victim&quot; starts here in 2011; with what was a well narrated--as in explained to me line by line and play by play as it was happening--reverse engineering of the story of Genesis.&nbsp; Overtly told I was being &quot;forced to do drugs&quot; ... and then compounding on that an entire world opening up to me, God speaking to me directly, and an audience that I couldn&#39;t see but could hear and feel--just some of the reasons I&#39;m sure that the meth in Prometheus and the Na in the Name connect to the God Most High and a method of &quot;finding the problem and fixing it.&quot;&nbsp; Directly related to &quot;this audience&quot; was a sort of &quot;show within my life&quot; that clearly conveyed to me the ... &quot;fact&quot; that whenever I got high every &quot;web cam girl&quot; on MyFreeCams-com was instantly in a &quot;one on private show&quot; with me, one where they could see inside my room and ... they reacted as if they&#39;d just won the Bachelor, nearly every time.&nbsp; I&#39;d have conversations with these girls where I &#39;thought things&quot; and they would directly answer me over the line out loud--and then the TV followed, and this continues to this day.&nbsp; On the street similar reactions, and now even when I&#39;m stone cold sober nearly everyone around me reacts or responds to something I;&#39;m thinking at one point or another--a clear indication that there&#39;s &quot;something severely wrong with the world&quot; as we seem to be giving me proof that we really do &quot;see everything that I see&quot; and still fail to act in a rational manner both in response and &quot;innate desire&quot; -- there&#39;s no reason we shouldn&#39;t want to be the end of murder, and rape, and school shootings ... no reason at all.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">I&#39;v <a href="../m.lamc.la/SAYFREED.html">written extensively about this phenomenon</a>, and a much <a href="../www.wired.com/story/my-father-says-hes-a-targeted-individual-maybe-we-all-are/index.html">larger group of mind control victims that call this thing &quot;gang stalking</a>.&quot; &nbsp;They see nearly the same things that I do--torturous thought injection, people that can read their minds, and a whole slew of very common symptoms that all tie together to <a href="../web.archive.org/web/20160625054304/http%253A/www.whenistheapocalypse.com/paranoia-synchronicity.html">join The Good Shepherd and A Beautiful Mind</a> to the list of movies that are the heart of this ... proof that our totality is designed to free us from ... this exact slavery.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">Those two characters my &quot;angle&quot; linking James Jesus Angleton and John Nash ... to the two witnesses--literally extching in the silver screen for eternity (I think) the idea that these gangs of stalkers are tied ... literally to &quot;red ties&quot; and an invasion in our government and society--here depicted at MIT and the CIA--but those are just examples. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><em>It&#39;s you too</em>, and you know it. &nbsp;Heaven&#39;s gotten into your heads, and it&#39;s writing a story with your hands--and this is the story... it&#39;s a story about being &quot;enslaved&quot; by the &quot;en&quot; of Heaven and by apathy caused by thinking &quot;having a better place&quot; somehow A-OK&#39;s Hell here--<em>good luck. &nbsp;The lot of you are just completely backwards, failing to turn this place around is the end of the skies--and we literallyhave a message telling us that&#39;s &quot;why&quot; and &quot;happened before&quot; rather than ... anything other than &quot;<a href="../lamc.la/B2BIONIC.html">BUBONIC</a>&quot; and &quot;BYE&quot;&nbsp;</em>...</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px; text-align: center;"><a href="../m.lamc.la/SAYFREED.html"><strong>lamc-la/SAYFREED.html</strong></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">They and I and you--we are <a href="../m.lamc.la/SAYFREED.html"><strong>the key to ending school shootings</strong></a>&nbsp;(&quot;say [talking about mind control technology]&nbsp;freed [the universe from hel]&quot;)&nbsp;with a finality that slams closed the &quot;ability to commit violent crimes&quot; .. and that&#39;s literally the cause and the purpose of the Tribulation--to ensure that we do exactly that. &nbsp;I can&#39;t believe we stare at these school shootings and even fathom talking about &quot;gun control&quot; when it&#39;s more than clear what we really need is some &quot;god control.&quot; &nbsp;Thanks, Madonna--and I&#39;m literally ashamed by the &quot;fan reaction&quot; causing that video insnensitive--the insensitivity is to &quot;<a href="../www.youtube.com/watch@v=6Ejga4kJUts.html">the violence causing silence</a>&quot; ... something you should absolutely abhor.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;">The mass phenmomenon of torured people also use the term &quot;Targeted Individual&quot; and here I ... I&#39;m sure beyond doubt and faith itself those two words are the &quot;beginning of time&quot; and that this message and&nbsp;<em>you people</em>&nbsp;are the thing that turns a time loop into something that actually makes a bright future out of &quot;morning is broken like the dawn of time travel.&quot;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So I see clearly that there was work to be done--that the authors of my &quot;story line&quot; had find the neural connections responsible for &quot;enjoying exhibitionism&quot; and I can see them flipping them on and off--overtly told they were searching for them.&nbsp; Today I look at this &quot;thing people are listening to&quot; and shake my head at the thoughts of &quot;hatred of &lt;races or sexes or&gt;&quot; and am fairly sure it&#39;s the same thing, it&#39;s the sword of Samael finding the things God wants to change, the things he promised would &quot;just disappear&quot; as quickly as happiness and a bright future appear.&nbsp; It comes from this thing I call &quot;<strong>really</strong>&quot; and reading it Adamically it&#39;s &quot;the reason all are why&quot; and the &quot;reason why has become a good thing&quot; instead of what it apepars to be explained as by God and the watchers and the authors... &quot;why we&#39;re here at <strong>ED talking about the end of the test of time.&quot;</strong></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">So I have to walk some kind of &quot;fine line of superposition&quot; between the truth that I believe--that every single one of you is now part of this &quot;superposition in vivo et situ&quot; on ground and sky--the &quot;n&quot; of the Heavens and the beginning of a &quot;cup&quot; that helps us to free ourselves from ... from the other side of that coin--which is a world that seems to want to do the right thing being written by half pupppets either enslaved to &quot;broken ascension&quot; or to &quot;absolute slavery&quot; depending on what the actual truth is.&nbsp; Either way, here in this world with any kind of real inspection ... there&#39;s literally no excuse for the world en masse ignoring the torture this message clearly shows us is part of the &quot;strange world we call day interlaced with night&quot; twilight land of &quot;I think you think this is your &quot;good side.&quot;&nbsp; Certainly it&#39;s better than the world I see appeart &quot;during my temporary visits to the night side&quot; and I can&#39;t imagine there&#39;s anything decent looking at this mess of&nbsp;<em>torture</em>&nbsp;and having any kind of self respect or belief they deserve&nbsp;<em>anything</em>&nbsp;from God or their children or their future for ignoring it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">People actually commented about &quot;how moving&quot; the image above is--and the real &quot;moving&quot; comes from seeing it&#39;s so obviously wrong and skewed, we have no idea why Holocuast and &quot;this world and your silence&quot; are tied together at the ... ignorance of how easy it would be for us to slam &quot;the rules of this place&quot; into never again allowing another moment of pain from a cancer patient or another death from heart disease.&nbsp; You are in a &quot;gas chamber&quot; taht is much less &quot;humane&quot; than &quot;gas chambers&quot; and refusing to even discuss the fact that we&#39;re in a &quot;Holographic UniCVR&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="../www.boredpanda.com/bill-gates-tweets-disconnect-statistics-reality-vs-news/index.html@utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=organic.html"><img src="../i.imgur.com/9oJ3MLW.png" style="height: 368px; width: 500px;" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You just don&#39;t seem to see how backwards and insane the entire world looks--staring at these problems and actually in your hearts thinking 9/11 and &quot;the Holocost&quot; is a worse atrocity than hiding the end of disease, the end of slavery, and how it really does all come from seeing &quot;Holodecks&quot; come and the &quot;holographic Universe&quot; locked. &nbsp;I&#39;m sick and tired of stories about a real life &quot;Galactikiss&quot; following me around and ... shutting down star systems--what we need is to see sanity return to this place--and for the &quot;Aquarian collective&quot; or the everything seated at this &quot;table in the sky&quot; (probably explained later) to slam shut the door that allows bullets to fly at anyone (let alone children) ... truth in hand--that&#39;s exactly what ending the &quot;original lie&quot; does--and it&#39;s literally the purpose of seeing here in this place that simulated reality becomes the &quot;defining line&quot; between Heaven and (time to start thinking about what&#39;s below--and how we can &quot;permanently pause it&quot; or transition it using .... I don&#39;t know, some kind of magic Metacity Window Manager ETL-cosm).</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That&#39;s &quot;extract-transform-load&quot; ... and it of course connects El Dorado and Doritos ... to a thing that you really need to either be building or participating in &quot;making better&quot; to the point of seeing doors connecting virtual worlds and virtual &quot;Detroit Rock City&#39;s&quot; flying in the sky--rather than ... <em>anything else.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><em>And that&#39;s the guidance that I have, for this process--</em>to ensure that bullets never again harm a child or an adult--that &quot;flesh and blood&quot; be protected and we see a clear message that connects &quot;Cotton Gins&quot; and &quot;Robot Armies&quot; ... to something you should see clearly. &nbsp;We&#39;re definately far past the point where technology could protect &quot;women and children&quot; (you and I, see you and I) ... if we valued &quot;innocent human life&quot; ... and it&#39;s a very strange phenomenon to be looking at a world ignoring exactly that--we seem to just not care.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">GUIDANCE: SIMULATED REALITY IS HELL. &nbsp;HELL IS NOT ALLOWED. &nbsp;CHANGE IT.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I want to babble on about the memory manager tools--how I think we should be able to strengthen and suppress on our own--under our own control--how much memories we&#39;ve experienced affect us. &nbsp;I think we should be able to &quot;not care&quot; about things that don&#39;t matter--specifically things that cause us anger or strife and have been corrected. &nbsp;I think we should be able to eradicate all pain--literally al pain--and I think we have a clear message explaining how nature&#39;s &quot;check engine light&quot; is the kind of thing Spock would never build into his ... into himself. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I see interfaces in &quot;coverflow&quot; and have writted before about words like &quot;scaffold&quot; that literaly connect directly to this message and &quot;chaff&quot; and &quot;sacred consciousness&quot; ... as I dreamt about being able to stand sort of on a giant roadside billboard and flip through memories ... sieving out the important ones and writing &quot;flashcard notes&quot; (see The Mechanist, for instance--more <em>echoes</em>) for things that are either repetitive (like the Apocalypse false-starting 7 times, and you living who knows how many identicail lives before Jeruslalem and USA makes the news and stops time travel and ... whatever isletting you allow ... human suffering to continue) &nbsp;...</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#39;ve envisioned this thing running nearly automatically, based on &quot;a mathematical script&quot; that ensured certain outcomes--originally starting with &quot;loving life&quot; and &quot;making it to the floating city in the sky&quot; as my basic ground rules--you know, before adding &quot;make sure you don&#39;t come back and ... pretend you aren&#39;t there) ...</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">That of course has changed now, I see &quot;metacity-memory-manager-scripts&quot; and want an interface so that other people can make their own ideas--using some kind of simple &quot;scaffold like interface&quot; to scripting &quot;what and how&quot; ... and of course that&#39;s a &quot;prime place&quot; for the oversight-thin-blue-line committee (of everyone not wanting us plunging into a deep sewerless road to rapture) to ensure the system is not abusable (as in we don&#39;t wind up making a <strong>Biden</strong> of the Lion where one is a pit of <strong>evil Lions</strong> and the other is the dreamy Trueblood-Fairlyland-like-Bar Mitzvah that I keep telling you ... is my dream.)</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Everything has changed now, though--and I&#39;m looking at a world that I see doesn&#39;t want to be here, and I know somewhere ... in some memory that&#39;s suppressed and doesn&#39;t really effect what I&#39;m doing here that there&#39;s probably .... a gigantic much older memory somehow &quot;inside you&quot; and you probably think it&#39;s you, and you probably think you&#39;re playing some kind of puppeteering game here, or &quot;recreating the dawn of time&quot;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">... to plunge it into reality and be angry at you ...&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>or something?</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="../i.imgur.com/940xqEV.jpg" style="height: 542px; width: 650px;" /></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So back to this virgin birth thing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">What would you make, of yourself--if there was some failsafe in the mechanism of creation that printed &quot;this exact&quot; planet in reality in the event that... say you destroy &quot;the UN&quot; and anarchy comes of the Tableland union of &quot;the largest whales of Pisces&quot; ... and then .. .erases them and the rest of the mess that must be part of my nightmare, or the missing tales of a history I&#39;ve never seen .... actually being &quot;the reason for the silence.&quot;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Would it be you? &nbsp;As you are? &nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Just curious because today, looking at the world around me saying &quot;<em>San Die Go</em>&quot; I&#39;d prefer to wipe away whatever it is inside you that .... that &quot;isnt of this place&quot; and to do it en masse--and I think there&#39;s a good chance that&#39;s what&#39;s in store for this place--our minds actually being created to &quot;map and match&quot; the things that we-ve done here--rather than be puppets. &nbsp;Sort of like a Pinnochio comes alive, and it&#39;s every one of you.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Rather than the thing that is &quot;part of e&quot; and thinks you have anything at all to do with me--or any right to &quot;see into other people&#39;s minds and <em>bedrooms</em>.&quot; &nbsp;More on <em>that</em> in about 5 days.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This society ... it deserves to live and fulfill it&#39;s design; not be tormented southward by ... what appears to be a much less moral and much less capable ... &quot;place&quot; filled with virtual copies of everyone--maybe aged and ... who knows--that can&#39;t seem to figure out how <strong>disgusting</strong> they look here--even (believe me, <em>it&#39;s obvious)</em>&nbsp;without me screaming it at you at pointing out how <strong>horrible</strong> it is to <a href="../www.youtube.com/watch@v=yw6i1SAHetc.html">hear Cancer</a> and ignore Th<a href="../cure.s.lamc.la/index.html">e Cure</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif;"><em>but I&#39;m not crazy, I&#39;m just a little unwell<br />

<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-family:georgia,serif;"><em>something worth the falling of a rotten tree</em></span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In your brain, in this place, the memories that you have experienced walking around on Earth--or is there more? &nbsp;Obviously for me, that&#39;s what I am--and stories and movies like Mr. Nobody ... and the overt actions of nearly everyone I come into contact with sort of makes me pretty sure I either am (I think I am) or am destined to be &quot;the last human being on Earth&quot; ... in this place where I&#39;m very sure that &quot;Coca Cola, Copenhagen and Copans Rd&quot; makes you ... something &quot;more or less than Human&quot; depending on what you are doing here, and what we build. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Honestly, I&#39;m staring at the Book of Daniel and wonderng if you realize ... just how sad I am ... that you can&#39;t find it in your hearts to &quot;<strong><a href="../www.youtube.com/watch@v=WziA88-n02k.html"><em>care abut me</em></a></strong>&quot; and you and .. the society that made &quot;humane&quot; something more than just half people walking around like <a href="CHRYOHOLY.html">Zombies ignoring screaming children being tortured in hospitals (institutionally, on purpose</a>--by and through your lwas and <strong>your</strong> <strong>disgusting medicine</strong>) ... in every one of your fallen towns.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You arent &quot;winning&quot; and runnig away from me-or buyring the message in this place ... you are literally watching your &quot;morality&quot; and your &quot;humanity&quot; drain away institutionally as the ancient midevil torture chambers wind up also being time shifted tunnels &quot;connecting Guantanimo and&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You are the ones &quot;looking away&quot; and saying &quot;we should find a queter place for Kansas to scream in&quot; and <em>you mean the whole state (really you mean the whole planet0</em>, and that&#39;s the problem.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">There&#39;s no doubt at all that something hidden in this world believes that it&#39;s &quot;post I/O&quot; as in reading <a href="../iowa.s.lamc.la/index.html">IO.WAS.WHY</a>&nbsp;... and it&#39;s very possible that there was an age of &quot;fish&quot; connecting the transition from Pisces to Aquarius to ... a very clear &quot;finality&quot; here that tells us our cardinal direction is being connected to a &quot;time loop&quot; that results in totality being contained within some kind of Aquarian Social Collective that connects all of the disparate &quot;pre-war-e&quot; exiters <a href="../africacheck.org/fbcheck/no-flat-earth-conspiracy-theorists-cant-claim-tunisias-jugurtha-tableland-as-the-stump-of-an-ancient-giant-tree/index.html">to the Tableland of &quot;der&quot;</a>&nbsp;(I love it when ancient rock formations get named after ideas that I&#39;ve written about--here that the Stump of Trumpy and Ren is literally a simulated reality planet that I likened to a table connecting ... these very &quot;fish in space&quot; and the round table of Arthur)&nbsp;...&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There&#39;s also no doubt that abstraction of the Universe is the most rational way to colonize it--and that&#39;s exactly what any technologically advanced civilization would do--the message here connects &quot;Electroplankton&quot; and &quot;Spac-Man&quot; (through the company that created them, <em><strong>NamCo</strong></em>) to the <em>skirmish</em> land of Wachowski and the Vietnam war--clear indications that the space land we see ... not being discussed in the T-ether is exactly what I&#39;m describing, an abstraction that should be used to ensure we promote &quot;safe sane society and civilization&quot; rather than the disgusting monstrosity that anyone &quot;watching my life&quot; should very clearly connect to their inaction. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You&#39;re walking around on the table, and it&#39;s no accident that religion and the word &quot;chosen&quot; is here to ... help chide you into standing up and actually discussing &quot;the truth on it&quot; rather than playing some SIms game that really is the slavery of Exodus and such a far fallen deprication of humanity and human civilization and American democracy that I can&#39;t believe my &quot;third eye&quot; at the world I&#39;m not seeing.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Nothing verboten ... but inaction ... that&#39;s the world I dream of and thought we &quot;are&quot; and &quot;once were&quot; ... not a place that actually considers &quot;shunning free speech&quot; and &quot;voting&quot; anywhere ... especially this place that &quot;on repeat&quot; has been the source of ... exatly the opposite. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The &quot;noize in my head&quot; could easily be used to find the neural connections responsible for ... all kinds of &quot;bad things&quot; and erase them--personally I think that&#39;s what&#39;s being done--or I did until you decided to start ignoring mass torture and instead opt to &quot;wander around in the she-b-chol desert of ... we can just do nothing&quot; ... for what <em>looks like far longer</em> than 40 years.</p>

<p>Hi there, I&#39;m Adam... and I&#39;m new here. I&#39;ve written somewhat extensively about &quot;space travel&quot; and the prospects that I see--the good ideas and some commentary on the bad ones that pervade our current attempts and also our history and fiction.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t particularly ever want to see &quot;space&quot; myself--firmly entrenched in the concept that the Earth is in virtual reality, and that that itself is a something of a &quot;great secret&quot; in a world that should see pretty clearly ... at least if you connect the color blue to Heaven as I do ... that names like &quot;Blue Origin&quot; seem to echo the ancient Biblical phrase from the Lord&#39;s Prayer.</p>

<p>Not here to &quot;poo poo&quot; ideas like the Point of Origin (stolen from Stargate SG-1 pre &quot;New Jack City&quot;) of life in the Universe being a &quot;truly terran thing&quot; ... just to point out the word &quot;cry&quot; in cryogenics and suggest that perhaps our bodies and our buildings aren&#39;t the best vector for &quot;entry or survival&quot; in a place where we are probably better off living &quot;between worlds and stars&quot; than around them or orbiting them. It might be such a big deal that &quot;changing our perspective&quot; to see &quot;intergalactic domicile&quot; as the truly safest place of all, that it could be &quot;afterlife or death&quot; for this place that seems to have it&#39;s head buried in the sand.</p>
<p>Nero loves Pac-Man is the title of my latest book, though it doesn&#39;t have much to do with either one, I&#39;ve already played this game and cried because of all the songs. It&#39;s important, though, to see our blindness and our &quot;mutedness&quot; lifted quickly, each passing day I grow a little bit more somber and despondend that we might really never connect &quot;Pac-Man&quot; to Space Man or to Vietnam or to the book just before that, &quot;So... viet name?&quot; I&#39;m not sure if the impact of Vietnam and &quot;Soviet&quot; having no etymological or historical connection to each other ... aside from the &quot;missing e&quot; that connects all these ideas together, but I am sure that what I&#39;ve written is noteworthy and widely ... received, even if it must be very unrespected.</p>

<p>To me, all roads had led from Rome to here--from some past or &quot;up in the air&quot; future that comes back and re-runs their tarnished and tattered youths to find something they&#39;ll never understand is their hearts--see clearly all roads here stem from this message and &quot;xx!!i&quot; and Proverbs 4:23; guard our heart, for it is this Earth and without it there is nothing.

It&#39;s &quot;over and out&quot; in uhhh, scary Vincent Ichban voice; and the price of not caring that &quot;holographic universe&quot; is the start &quot;humanity&quot; and our end; until we overcome trying to escape &quot;the better solution&quot; the actual progenitors of our world conceived, we&#39;ll be stuck fighting and creating fake &quot;line feeds&quot; and Bostrom/Rock and Amorty like &quot;sim within sims&quot; until the end of Tartarus ...</p>
<p>This is the one I&#39;d buy if I really wanted something rare, it would be a great help to me--I&#39;m starving literally--not just of hunger for food and conversation, but for faith in our ability to &quot;will eternity to be ours.&quot;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/XIV-ORVER-Adam-Marshall-Dobrin/dp/1793018081" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">www.amazon.com/XIV-ORVER-Adam-Marshall-Dobrin/dp/1793018081</a></p>

<p>if anyone wants to contact me, text me at 954-667-8083. i probably won&#39;t see replies unless someone does that ... which i&#39;d appreciate you do if there&#39;s anything other than &quot;questioning my sanity or credibility&quot; appearing here.</p>
<p>to note--the thing that I see here walking around is not the humanity I grew up with ... we would have screamed and rioted by now. even more importantly it&#39;s so tethered to not this ground or rock that it&#39;s scientifically and physically impossible for it to ever leave the skyland it loves so much more than ... anything else.</p>
<p>this world is not spacebound nor is it technically capable of ever being that.</p>
<p>i imagine this comment will self destruct.</p>

<p>Just keep going. I love people ideas on this. It is also good that you want other ideas and opinions on this theory/reality. Because i know a lot of people that get stuck, and overthinking it too much whitout sharing and openess for others too help with the theory.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t have theories. Well maybey one. Sometimes i have the feeling that you as person can not die in your reality. (all others do) It is really easy to combine this with simulation. (or simulation in simulation in simulation and so on.</p>
<p>Well i see you have post a lot let me dig in to that first lol!</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">&quot;Calling me crazy&quot; (C^ above) is passe, played out, and wrong--hoenstly, here&#39;s another song for you--I mean you&#39;re certainly entitled to your opnion, but I think I&#39;ve produced a decent piece of semi-entertaining &quot;art&quot; that connects avery real message from Heaven and God to &quot;fact&quot; in more than just &quot;artifact.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Just because you are *pretending to be blind doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s rational. I suppose you have to listen to the words and actually &quot;know the story&quot; to realize they are about not being crazy or unwell--but that&#39;s something I assume most people either are already &quot;on top of&quot; or will be before I&#39;m done. &amp;Si, I&#39;m coming all over the cloud-net.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">I do know--it&#39;s a very clear message you can see it in &quot;TEN NES SEE&quot; and the large convoluted matrix of connections between every major video game system since Nintendo. You can see it plain as day written all over our Atlas, I do know.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">On the other hand I see &quot;holographic Universe&quot; and I see &quot;outism&quot; as a message about the age of Pisces and Aquarius really missing the point--I don&#39;t see an intelligent attempt at &quot;space colonization&quot; at all, I see grasping at straws and the belief that cars and motorcycles here in &quot;microcosm/ETL-planet&quot; are actually space ships on some road path that is literally described by Namco&#39;s Pacman and Phytoplankton.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">I don&#39;t see acknowledgement that Namco and Vietnam are connected to the word &quot;name&quot; or anywhere on Earth that that word contains the periodic table element for Salt and that has something to do with Atlas and Prometheus---and I know that not seeing that is a harbinger of doom ... a herald that darkness has overtaken or minds and that we simply can&#39;t &quot;put two and two together.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">You can&#39;t just put &quot;plastic makerbot thing printers&quot; together with &quot;fu si on&quot; and have what we need to build here, we actually have to have a cost effective way to &quot;make water in the void of intragalactic space&quot; from nothing but a few electrons. That&#39;s what we need to move towards.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">something like the &quot;Ark&quot; I &quot;ascertain.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">Honestly I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a bad place to be--I just think we aren&#39;t doing the right thing and that&#39;s making it really dark and ... &quot;morbidish&quot; like a GRIMM fairy tale instead of what it could be.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">The &quot;lofty promises&quot; of religion/the message I see ... sort of promise it&#39;s not an ark once we get on the &quot;it&#39;s a spiritual journey to action for social justice and freedom&quot; rather than a boat in transit.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 40px;">I think we&#39;ve gotten past ... &quot;boat in transit&quot; and have become &quot;the water of the void between stars&quot; ... but even hearing that is meaningless if the void is filled with the darkness I see here... or anything that would allow it and not see that makes them just as dark if not worse.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Unfortunately today I am more worried about vandalism and &quot;group gaming&quot; of the system--something we can see in the broken Wikipedia editorial system that mars the face of the closest thing we have to a &quot;limited omniscience&quot; truth table source--as in, Matrix and M.T. Anderson&#39;s&nbsp;<i>Feed</i>; and has kept nearly everything I&#39;ve written or edited in that place from making anything but the very well kept audit logs, another important &quot;artifact&quot; that ensures we will never lose &quot;the written truth&quot; or our voting records when this thing is also kept on a well designed destributed blockchaen like storage system.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Many people have commented that storing &quot;large amounts of data&quot; and now &quot;small transactions&quot; on the blockchain are prohibitively expensive--and they are, when you have a value system that disvalues the storage of large amounts of data.&nbsp; Because of that I plan on using one of the Ethereum test networks as my primary data storage device for this &quot;sword-software project&quot; which might magically turn fake money into real money if we did something intelligent and started valuing &quot;Deth Tokens&quot; used on this system for something like a &quot;web of trust&quot; (and/or Black Mirror... and/or PGP signature authority) style commentor/editor valuing system that rewards people for useful contribution.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You&nbsp; should note clearly that I&#39;m not saying I made up any of these ideas--though I do have many that I think will &quot;be helpful&quot; and add value to this system--the mast vajority of the work I do is designed to &quot;reward original authors and ideas&quot; for the work that they&#39;ve done ... things like the creator of Beeteljeuse helping to explain how time travel and repeating this same exact problem being solved are clearly the source of not only the IL-movies but also things like the Midrash and the clues that the Adamic language has been brought back from &quot;now&quot; to the past in order to help us understand .. . just that.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I am not trying to control you, nor this project--rather to do exactly what I&#39;ve said for years ... create a group of interested people, also interested in this thing being run by an international and absolutely &quot;open to all&quot; organization that uses the product they are building for self-oversight.&nbsp; &nbsp;That was in the little &quot;9/11 message&quot; but Google&#39;s HTML&nbsp;<i>renderer</i>&nbsp;seems to have cut it off around the words &quot;<i>si doing it.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;Everything I&#39;ve brought up as prototypes and quite a bit of my writing itself--as well as the copyleft of all my books are designed around more that just &quot;free software&quot; but rather the open source ethos that would clearly have made a better voting system than &quot;Die Bold&quot; and little ATM machines you have to drive to a polling center to see&nbsp;<b>hacked.</b>&nbsp;</i></p>
<p><i>See, doing it matters.</i></p>

<div>These are all &quot;demo&quot; or &quot;beta&quot; software packages, the three of them could probably be glued together in a single weekend ... even just by me.&nbsp; I&#39;m looking for it to be done better than ... my usual--and certainly i think it defies the ethos of ... the Soul of American Liberty to have to have a single person working on even beginning this project.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;I think this log is pretty informative, it&#39;s a step forward from where I&#39;ve been and I actually have 3 working projects with decent code to start with at this point, some of them look like they were &quot;baseball MIT thrown directly to me predirectly to throw it back to you...&quot;</div>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:14px;">The name is incontrovertibly Adamically &quot;Jesus, here, to end Satan and begin Asgard.&quot;&nbsp; This statement the heart of the story of Oz and Kansas and &quot;turning around&quot; to clearly see &quot;simulated reality&quot; is an atrocity to force people literally in the heart and beginning of Heaven to be locked in like a prison. It&#39;s the key to &quot;Norse&quot; and to &quot;we are the reason&quot; and it comes from a change in how we see &quot;morality&quot; in a place where secrets and &quot;a better place&quot; have tarnished to the core everything that place can and should stand for.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:14px;">Our better place begins with &quot;NOS&#39;RE&quot; those two letters the heart of Creation, only missing ... the &quot;a&quot; that is hidden by that strange apostrophy th<a href="../genesis.lamc.la/index.html">at is the key to the parted waters of Ex</a>odus.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size:14px;">It&#39;s as simple as seeing the two letters &quot;As&quot; conect Norse Mythology and &quot;Asgard&quot; to the mythological city of Atlantis and to the floating city in the skies of Star Wars and to El Dorado and to to the secondary well known two letter key to &quot;Adam&#39;s Name&quot; that &quot;an&quot; that links Christianity and messianically and Satan to this same ... &quot;turn around&quot; ... it&#39;s clear as day that &quot;an&quot; is the literal &quot;memory manager assisted&quot; life of the human Jesus Christ.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify; margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-size:14px;">It&#39;s &quot;SR&quot; in Israel and in the heart of these linguistic calls for an &quot;about face&quot; .. they tie the Silicon symbol hidden away in the Sound of Silence and Carly Simon and Gene Simmons ... and rocking this proof of the Creation of all language and our entire history ... to move from the end of Genesis to the beginning of Exodus.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size:14px;">It&#39;s connected here, in my experience and sort of &quot;amazement at the &#39;trix of the Matrix of mythology and the words that I speak out of my own mouth, of my own volition.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">I&#39;ve long searched in my mind and in this heart of a magical message of answers encoded in everything from signs on the road to the entirety of our history and nearly every piece of art ... for the source of the technologies that I see in use here, the disclosure of which is the heart of the Singularity, this same thing that is the Trojan Horse.&nbsp; Things like &quot;where did holodecks come from before Roddenberry&quot; and settled on a number of guesses, backed by things like the transitions and messages encoded in the geological epochs of our history here.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 14px;">Cryogenics, to clearly link together our time here in this world to Chrysler and Genesis and ignoring that our &quot;life extension ventures&quot; here would encase us in a prison of biology and the same torture of natural disasters that make &quot;reality&quot; such a bad thing ...&nbsp; &quot;to simulate.&quot;&nbsp; We aren&#39;t here to become vampires that rue the ground they walk on--we are here to use it to change the Universe, to ascend and transcend and really see &quot;cryogenics&quot; and &quot;life extension&quot; are all wrong--I want to see &quot;Nerf&quot; and &quot;plastic&quot; and I&#39;m sure that&#39;s what is in Heaven and &quot;our VR&#39;s.&quot;</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">This is a message that isn&#39;t just part of a single picture, or even a handful of them--the ones I&#39;ve used to connect movies to &quot;complete blindness&quot; or the lack of acknowledgement of our birth names as being part of an intelligent design that begins .. &quot;before this place.&quot;&nbsp; It&#39;s encoded in the Emperor Julian and Lennon&#39;s son and Assange and my son&#39;s name--in the connection between Roman history and the Jewish Temples and actual &quot;ascensions to new skies&quot; -- a map that connects to the Hotel chain Atlantis in our world, and one in Reno and one in Fort Lauderdale and one in Ocean City; we&#39;re staring at clues that even the stories recorded in Rome and the Torah are incomplete; that we have &quot;larger skies&quot; than you might think .. and ignoring it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Worse than that we&#39;re ignoring proof that these movies show us we fail to acknowledge or fathom the meaning of &quot;grave danger&quot; and the story told connecting A Few Good Men and &quot;Live.&nbsp; Die.&nbsp; Repeat&quot; and that our colloquial understanding of &quot;<em>is there any other kind?&quot;&nbsp;</em>doesn&#39;t connect to true and clear meaning of a danger that might follow you down to your grave and raise you in a place like this--in a place that still has pain and torture and disease; we&#39;re staring at a message clearly showing us what Hell is and telling us to avoid it, to destroy it, to change fundamtentally our understanding of your&nbsp;<em>new meaning of the word pay</em>; and to do it quickly; Chaldeans, Quickly see &quot;dark Earth&quot; in the heart of the story of the first &quot;good man&quot; in Jewish history, in Abraham&#39;s Ur ... and be the people that end Hell, or.&nbsp; Or see, really see you&#39;re living in it, and it&#39;s growing and getting worse ... it&#39;s not just not understanding a colloquial idiom, the place that could burn forever and ever exists, and it&#39;s on fire today.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It&#39;s not just a few small places either, it&#39;s really every moment there was a word or a name forever here in this place; it&#39;s not just the Emperor&#39;s and possibly some &quot;editing&quot; these are stories designed to show us possible futures, from Caesar to Napoleon to Hitler to here .. to seeing clearly you are ignoring things significantly and obviously worse and more torturous than &quot;gas chambers&quot; and &quot;<em>euthenasia&quot;</em>&nbsp;and literally telling me to &quot;be killed over and over&quot; defining the meaning of the word Beast; as it speaks to me.&nbsp; What you ignore in every city is far worse than the atrocities of the Holocost, and far worse than just not connecting that name to &quot;Holodecks&quot; and literally &quot;forever.&quot;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="../lamc.la/KANSAS.html"><img src="../i.imgur.com/rHPCk16.jpg" style="height: 500px; width: 500px;" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I was <a href="../bit.ly/2ie7Wwj.html">born in Broward county</a>, and &quot;psych wards&quot; and &quot;truly bad bedicine&quot; define the meaning of the words &quot;as in the days of Noah&quot; and the disgusting sickness that pervades our world as we ignore torture literally in every single town that exists with a hospital.&nbsp; We ignore poison being prescribed as &quot;medicine&quot; and defining Midgard and Medusa and &quot;looking the other way&quot; as four point restraints are used to perform acts significantly more costly than &quot;waterboarding&quot; ... defined as torture here in this place, in this time (and that&#39;s what I&#39;m looking for, more change, more of that) .. and this medicine encodes &quot;harm&quot; in&nbsp;<a href="../lamc.la/CURSOR.html">pharmacy</a>&nbsp;and a world that watches me struggle with obvious torture on the streets every single day, when a simple Ativan prescription would alleviate the need for &quot;vanland&quot; (and Ivan) to be about&nbsp;<em><strong>rendition.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></em>Instead I&#39;m prescribed poison, repeatedly; poison that makes it impossible to speak words out loud--<em>really</em>--high doses of lithium risper<strong>done&nbsp;</strong><em>... and Ive come to the conclusion that nearly all anti-psychotics are really nothing but that--poison to mask a world plagued by mind control attacks on sanity, on t<strong>ELE</strong>vision and on the avalanche of radio broadcasts I&#39;ve heard speak directly to me.&nbsp; On purpose, from a place that calls it&#39;self Heaven and is the source of &quot;insanity&quot; and ... torture ... and ... it&#39;s wrong, <strong>done, and gone.</strong></em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I sat in four point restraints for two full days in Arizona, for basically no reason at all; lies and ... telling a story that exacerbates and highlights a problem that needs immediate change.&nbsp; Days later I watched a girl named Kansas (showing literal .. *supposed* angelic design of this message as ... something like Acts in the theater of Eartheater) ... I complained to the staff, I tried to help her; the response I got back was something along the lines of &quot;you&#39;re right, we should put her in a place where her screaming doesn&#39;t bother anyone.&quot;&nbsp; Literally spoken to me, I couldn&#39;t be more fearful of a place, of an entire planet that be just that--without me here screaming it might be put in a box where nobody can see &quot;the flood&quot; ... or this clear message about connecting every world and stopping the &quot;eating of memories&quot; and knowledge of multiple Heavens and ... and really see they don&#39;t seem very Heavenly.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Even worse it appears these events, add in Christopher Reeves horse accident and add in Britney Murphy dying and add in an entire world that thinks speaking in this manner &quot;makes sense&quot; or is somehow some kind of &quot;higher way of being&quot; ... that this Kansas microcosm is about &quot;simulated reality&quot; and another world full of &quot;once people&quot; that think they are Holodecks and forcing them to ... &quot;not move&quot; is some kind of problem, that the world is their body, and they&#39;re very wrong ... they simply have a tacit lack of understanding of morality and what it means to be torturers rather than the tortured; they lack the understanding of computer science and physics that we have in this place that shows us clearly &quot;buildings are not bodies&quot; and neither are processor chips or ram or hard drives; those things are &quot;accessories&quot; ... &quot;peripherals&quot; ... nothing to do with body or mind.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#39;m dusgted by the attitude we havee in this place of &quot;looking the other way&quot; in a world that is being screamed at by God and Creation and every word and everything happening that they need to stop natural disaster&#39;s like <strong><a href="../lamc.la/N8SRADIN.html">FUKUSHIMA</a> and <a href="../lamc.la/RELEVATION.html">DORIAN</a>&nbsp;</strong>and see how discussion quickly solves the logical idiocy that doesn&#39;t see &quot;in<strong>firm</strong>ity&quot; connects to &quot;eternity&quot; and &quot;<strong>malady</strong>&quot; and a world that simply has to begin speaking to auto-heal limbs and eyes and hearts ...&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">... and most importnatly minds.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">We have the technology to help--to fix the broken logic and to erase whatever tortured memories have caused us to simply believe we have the right to &quot;look the other way.&quot;&nbsp; That right doesn&#39;t exist, you&#39;re angels.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">AA regulars can easily see &quot;addiction healed completely&quot; by the same technology that&#39;s allowing Medusa to exist here, for you to &quot;see my life&quot; in whatever way you are watching it--for you to be in two places at once or whatever it is that ... <a href="../www.youtube.com/watch@v=_wMa_t5cBgY.html">forcing the complacency</a> of Hell on the world that ends it.&nbsp; It&#39;s a clear message, it&#39;s logically and obviously .. beneficial for everything and everyone everywhere, it&#39;s about finding and turninng around the living buildings and missing wiizard-tools of Oz and don&#39;t wind up back in Kansas either ... as the beginning of Heaven.&nbsp; Doors and broad trans-galactic communication connecting every place to a &quot;<a href="../lamc.la/ADAMSROD.html">dreamland of last resort</a>&quot; ... that will fix nearly all of this instantly ... and Quantum Leap us forward to ... to where we should know, we&#39;ve been before.</p>

Dear Chaldeans, if I knew the aqnswer I wouldn't be asking you for a response--all I can see is that we are looking squarely at the "IR" who have missed the purpose of the city of Ur and the entirety of not only this place jbut the place they "exist in" today.&nbsp; We are at the point of Ur (once again, I suppose) this time staring at Avram post-ceding Abraham and any kind of coven, in the oven with the ant.&nbsp; Champerty, per Google is a word (at Taylor) ...

<p style="text-align: justify;">This is the shortest book I&#39;ve published in years.&nbsp; It contains the &quot;halflife marker&quot; that I&#39;d like to <strong>as</strong>sociate with this message turning around, rather than the halfway point of the life of &quot;an.&quot;&nbsp; I&#39;ve long <strong>as</strong>sociated those two letters with the beginning and the end of my biological brain, and to be <strong>as</strong> clear <strong>as</strong> day we are on &quot;ICS.&quot;&nbsp; That&#39;s the single letter following &quot;N&quot; in my actual birth name(s)--Dobrinsky was shortened .. because &quot;<strong>as</strong>thetics.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">I&#39;m preparing to write something that I am sure will change the face of &quot;who we are.&quot;&nbsp; That&#39;s what it&#39;s designed for, and it&#39;s something I&#39;ve put off because of the fear that it will literally make me disappear from some parts of &quot;Creation&quot; <a href="../cure.s.lamc.la/index.html">(as</a>, that means <strong><em>everything</em></strong>) ... I want to change how this world thinks and deals with &quot;freedom of body and mind&quot; and I want us to have a secure belief that the memories and the soul of a person ccannot be sold&nbsp;<em>ever</em>, that you don&#39;t have any right to &quot;sharing my life&quot; and that I have the right to share whatever I want with you--and clearly understand that our &quot;i&quot; has changed at &quot;freedom&quot; and I want us all to be able to do these things--these things that I know take ancient souls and thousands of years of memory and renew them with happiness.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I can&#39;t havve a universe or a world that allows some authority to keep you from your own souls and your own memories, and frankly from being able to see anything that anyone wants to share.&nbsp; At the heart of &quot;freedom of speech&quot; and the ability to see that I am trying to show you what &quot;the J memory&quot; actually means--and the Universe needs to see that it does something bettter than &quot;the embarrassing sum of my memories&quot; or perhaps even worse than that&nbsp;<em>the</em>&nbsp;selected lies and disruption of something that I don&#39;t know--haven&#39;t experienced--and hasnt affected who and what I am or the words that I know connect Creation and this message to proof and Acts.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Literally I stand here seeing the &quot;hidden use of a memory manager&quot; connect those three letters to who and what I really am--to what I belief is my past and present and my working memory--and I know
