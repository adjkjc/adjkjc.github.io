<h2>17. The Hilltop, Howard University</h2>
<div class="he-mod" data-block="paragraph-86"></div>
<p>The Hilltop was co-founded by acclaimed author and Howard alumna Zora Neale Hurston. Hurston never actually wrote for the newspaper, but provided guidance for student journalists.</p>
<div class="he-mod" data-block="paragraph-87"></div>
<p>The first issue of The Hilltop was published January 22, 1924. The front page of the first issue covered a timeless and sensitive Howard issue: registration follies. The paper was brief, chronicling events that took place the semester before, and touching on a few upcoming campus events.<br>
By 1929, the newspaper was published bi-monthly. A year later, in 1930, The Hilltop became a weekly newspaper and remained so for 71 years. Within that time, the paper progressed steadily as a forum for African American writers to hone their journalistic skills.</p>
