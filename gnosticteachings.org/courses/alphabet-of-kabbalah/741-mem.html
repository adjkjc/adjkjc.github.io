Alphabet of Kabbalah Course

<p><img style="float: right; margin-bottom: 30px; margin-left: 30px;" title="The Hebrew letter Mem" src="https://gnosticteachings-rochen.netdna-ssl.com/images/stories/alefbet/mem/letters-ref-mem.jpg" alt="The Hebrew letter Mem" width="161" height="299" />Mem מ is the thirteenth letter of the Kabbalistic Hebrew alphabet. It is also the second of the five final letters that when at the end of a Hebrew word are depicted differently.</p>
<p>You can see the two shapes of the letter in the spelling of the word מם&nbsp;Mem. On the right, the first shape is open at the bottom, it has a gap. This gap symbolizes the flowing wave made by the י&nbsp;Iod through the ray of creation, the ו&nbsp;Vav. The closed shape on the left also represents creation, but in potentiality, not in activity.</p>
<p>If we observe the shape of both Mem letters, we can visualize two previous letters. On the right side of the letter, we see כ Kaf, the eleventh Kabbalistic letter. In a previous lecture we talked very extensively about the letter כ Kaf. On the left side of the shape of Mem is the letter ו Vav, which is the sixth letter of the Kabbalistic alphabet. So, the letter י&nbsp;Iod, which is the head of the letter Vav is resting on the top of the letter Kaf. The bottom of the open letter מ Mem is made by the base of Vav and Kaf, but Kaf and Vav are closed in the ם final Mem, since the letter Vav is completely attached to the letter Kaf.</p>
<p>Mem is indeed a very profound letter, because it relates to creation and Kabbalistically to many profound things or words that we are going to teach today.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 24pt;">יום</span></p>
<p>To begin, let us see how the letter itself explains the Hebrew word יום yom, which means "day."</p>
<p>The letter Vav is made by extending its head, the letter Iod. We always find the letter&nbsp;י&nbsp;Iod as a small wave at the very top left of the letter Mem. Iod symbolizes Kether. Iod is the tenth letter of the Hebrew alphabet and is the first letter of יהוה Iod-Hei-Vav-Hei, the sacred name of God. So it is very important to see that the letter&nbsp;י&nbsp;Iod, as a small wave, is precisely at the top left in both variations of the letter Mem.</p>
<p>Let us observe the second stroke of the open letter Mem מ, which is made by the letter ו Vav or by the letter Iod, which when stretched reaches the bottom to even the first stroke or letter כ Kaf – from that second stroke of the opened Mem we take two letters, the י Iod and the ו Vav.</p>
<p>Thus י Iod ו Vav ם final Mem, spell the word יום yom, which means "day" in Hebrew. In the book of Genesis we find the word יום yom in all the days of creation, namely, the first יום yom, the second יום yom, that is, the first day, the second day, etc...</p>
<p>The י Iod plus the final Mem spells another word, ים yam, a word similar to יום yom. ים Yam means "sea, ocean." This is because both letters םמ Mem together with the letter י Iod in the middle, spell the word מים mayim, water.</p>
<p>So in the shape of both open Mem and final Mem, we see that the letter Iod is like a wave at the top left, which expresses that the Iod, which is the beginning of יהוה Iod-Hei-Vav-Hei, as a water wave, makes poosible the flowing of the Logos, the word. That is why in <a href="https://gnosticteachings.org/faqs/kabbalah.html" >Kabbalah</a> the letter Mem symbolizes water.</p>
<p>The letter Mem is one of the three mother letters that we always address in <a href="https://gnosticteachings.org/faqs/kabbalah.html" >Kabbalah</a>, namely Aleph, Shin, and Mem. We talked about Aleph in our first lecture. Now we address Mem, the symbol of water, which is always placed at the sephirah Yesod, the ninth sephirah of the Tree of Life. In the sephirah Yesod, we find the sexual energy.</p>
<p><img style="float: right; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 20px;" title="The Sephiroth of Kabbalah on the Tree of Life" src="https://gnosticteachings-rochen.netdna-ssl.com/images/stories/kabbalah/tree-of-life-dimensions-color-2.jpg" alt="The Sephiroth of Kabbalah on the Tree of Life" width="347" height="500" />Yam, or sea, is a symbol of the Absolute. Remember that above the Tree of Life, there are three aspects of the Absolute, namely, the Ain, the Ain Soph, and the Ain Soph Aur. The letter ם final Mem is related with the second aspect, Ain Soph. In other words, the word soph, which means "end, final," relates to the letter ם final Mem. We can say that it relates to the Unmanifested Mother. This is why in Gnostic esotericism we call ם final Mem "the Unmanifested Mother," the Soph, the end, the limitless; so Ain Soph is related to the ם final Mem, as we see it in the word ים, which means sea, which is where Iod (Kether) joins with the unknowable divine, the abstract absolute space, the final Mem; it is where the uncreated light ends and begins, the Unmanifested Mother, which I repeat is called Soph: the Ain Soph.</p>
<p>The Ain Soph also relates to the letter ה Hei of the holy name יהוה. Many times we have explained that the first explanation of the sacred name of God, which is יהוה Iod-Hei-Vav-Hei, that is translated in the Bible as Jehovah, relates to the three first Sephiroth of the Tree of Life: Kether, Chokmah, Binah—Iod Hei Vav—and the second ה Hei is placed in the Absolute, the Ain Soph, which is that feminine aspect, the unknowable feminine aspect, from where all the sephiroth emanate.</p>
<p>So יהוה Iod-Hei-Vav-Hei are Kether, Chokmah, Binah, and Ain Soph. יהוה Iod-Hei-Vav-Hei is the one Light, God, Yehidah, the Tetragrammaton that expresses through Kether, which in the shape of the letter Mem is represented by the letter כ Kaf, because the spelling of Kether begins with כ Kaf. Thus כ Kaf in the letter Mem represents the three primary forces—Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—plus Ain Soph, the unknowable divine, which is the second ה Hei in יהוה Iod-Hei-Vav-Hei. All of this is synthesized in the letter Mem. As you see, it is easy to Kabbalistically grasp it and see it, because it is Kabbalistically hidden.</p>
<p>The letter כ Kaf on the right of the shape of מ Mem has, as we know, a value of 20. The letter ו Vav, on the left of the shape of Mem, has the value of 6. If we make the addition, we get 26, which is also the same value of יהוה Iod-Hei-Vav-Hei, because Iod is 10, Hei is 5, Vav is 6, and Hei again is 5, so you get 26, so it has the same value as the sacred name of God. This is why the letter final Mem hides the unmanifested and manifested God within.</p>
<p>The unmanifested ם final Mem, which is the Soph Mem or Mem Sophit ("final Mem"), is related to two of the three aspects of the Absolute: Ain Soph and Ain Soph Aur. The aspect we are addressing here is the second of the three, the Ain Soph.</p>
<p>The letter Mem is used to write the words Maya and Om.</p>
<p>In the Mayan bible, the Popol Vuh, we find a beautiful explanation of how the sea of life, in its abstract aspect, is described. The bible of the Mayans states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This is the account of how the wholeness was in suspense, in calm, in silence; motionless wholeness, still, and empty the vastness of space. This is the first account, the first narrative. There was neither man, nor animal, birds, fishes, crabs, trees, stones, caves, ravines, grasses, nor forests; there was only the broad vastness of space. There, the surface of the earth had not appeared. There, were only the calm sea and the great vastness of space. There, nothing was brought together, nothing that could make a sound, nor anything that might move, or tremble, or that could hum in space. There, nothing was standing; only the calm water, the placid, solitary, and tranquil sea: Nothing existed. There was only immobility and silence in the darkness, in the night. Only the Creator, the Maker, Tepeu, Gucumatz, the Forefathers, were in the water, surrounded by light. They were hidden under green and blue feathers, and were therefore called Gucumatz; innately great sages, great thinkers. In this manner space existed, and also the heart of Heaven, which is the name of God, and thus is how He is called. - Popol Vuh (The Mayan Bible)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This beautiful thought of the Mayan masters is a description of the Ain Soph together with those elements that we call יהוה Iod-Hei-Vav-Hei, but in repose, ready to begin their activity. So in other words, this is how the Mayans describe the universe emerging from the womb of the Divine Mother.</p>
<h2>The Letter Mem and the Divine Mother</h2>
<p>That womb is the unknowable, and this is why the letter Mem symbolizes the womb. The מ open Mem, which has a gap in the bottom, is the womb that is ready for parturition; it is that womb from which all the days of Genesis emerge, except the first. The first day is related with the ם final Mem, which is closed, represented in the word בראשית Bereshith (Genesis).</p>
<p>We stated previously that Bereshith is an anagram, and here we are going to explain it in relation with the letter Mem, in order to see how profound this Kabbalistic Genesis, the book of the Gnostics, is.<span style="text-align: center;">￼</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img title="Adam Kadmon" src="https://gnosticteachings-rochen.netdna-ssl.com/images/stories/alefbet/mem/AdamKadmon.jpg" alt="Adam Kadmon" width="400" height="550" /></p>
<p>As you remember from the lecture on כ Kaf, we explained that בראשית Bereshith encloses the word ראש resh ("head"). The letter ר Resh represents a head. The letter ב Beth represents a house. So the head of God, as illustrated in the graphic, is Adam Kadmon Shani, which is the symbol of the head of God, which is the letter Iod that appears as Kether, the first sephirah of the Tree of Life. That head, spot, or Iod emerges from the Hei, the unknowable, because the Hei as the unknowable feminine aspect is the source of Kether.</p>
<p>Now, when Kether, the Iod, appears—which is that head—within that head the Hei is hidden. That Hei is the first Hei of יהוה Iod-Hei-Vav-Hei, and appears as his breath in order to create through the Logos, the Word. Their creation is the universe, represented in the letter Vav. So, the one that shapes the universe is always the unknowable and knowable Hei, the Mother.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img title="The birth of Minerva" src="https://gnosticteachings-rochen.netdna-ssl.com/images/stories/alefbet/mem/minerva.png" alt="The birth of Minerva" width="560" height="363" />￼ ￼</p>
<p>The Father is also a creator, but the Father only gives the י Iod, the seed. The Mother shapes it for nine months. We will say in Kabbalistic terms that the י Iod, the Father, which is Kether, gives the seed, and with it the mother חוה Chavah (Eve) creates the other nine Sephiroth, the Tree of Life חיים. That is why the Divine Mother is hidden; she becomes visible as the daughter of that head Adam Kadmon Shani. As you see in the graphic, we see the Atik Yomin, the Ancient of Ancients, seated on his throne. Emerging from his head the Shechinah, his "daughter"; the Divine Mother is that Shechinah, the 'Hei' but in a visible aspect.</p>
<p>In Greek and Roman mythology, we also find this myth, as Athena / Minerva, the daughter of Zeus / Jupiter. She was born from his head.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://gnosticteachings.org/faqs/kabbalah.html" >Kabbalah</a>, in the Zohar, the Shechinah on the head of the ancient of days is another Iod, on top of the Iod. It forms the crown of the Ancient of Days. The crown of the Ancient of Days is Shechinah, the Divine Mother, who becomes Kether's daughter.</p>
<p>In the word בראשית Bereshith is the explanation of this process. The letter ב Beth at the beginning together with the letter ת Tav at the end of the word, make the word בת bath, which in Hebrew means "daughter." The letters between Beth and Tav are ראשי which spell the word rashi, meaning "first, chief, origin, prima," indicating the most important performer or role, the first. So if we relate this to Italian, we form prima donna, "the first lady," yet, in Hebrew we say, ראשי בת, "the first daughter." Do you see the beautiful symbol here?</p>
<p>Genesis 1:1 can be translated as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: left;">בראשית ברא אלהים את השמים ואת הארץ</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">"The first daughter created Elohim , the heavens, and&nbsp;the earth."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bereshith is the first word of Genesis. The second and third words are Bera Elohim.</p>
<p>That daughter coming from the head of the Ancient of Days, the Father, is the first visible feminine aspect. That feminine aspect is the Divine Mother always hidden in the three primary forces, represented in the letter א Aleph. She is "wisdom," Chokmah, the second Sephirah, the Son, which corresponds to the second letter ה 'Hei' of the name of God יהוה. She is in that ה Hei within Chokmah, as well as in the Iod in the head of Kether, which is the Iod of יהוה Iod-Hei Vav-Hei. So, She manifests herself in all the Sephiroth in different ways. She is also at the end of יהוה Iod-Hei Vav-Hei, because we know that the last Hei is also the Unknowable She.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 24pt;">אימה</span></p>
<p>Aleph, Iod, Mem, and Hei spell אימה aima, "mother." אימה Aima is Aima Elohim or Akash, Aima Elah-Yam, "the Sea Goddess Mother."</p>
<p>This universe is represented in the shape of the letter א Aleph, which as we explained previously represents the three sephiroth Kether, Chokmah, Binah, which relate to the worlds of Atziluth, Briah and Yetzirah. All of this manifested existence (א) comes from י Iod, מ Mem, and the ה Hei, the Ain Soph. Thus: אימה: all of the universe comes from the Divine Mother.</p>
<p>The Iod is hidden in the shape of the letter מ Mem, at the top left. The two letters together form the word ים yam, which means "sea." ים yam is at the end of אלהים Elohim, which is the word that means "Gods and Goddesses."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The waters (in Ain) above the firmament (Atziluth), the male part ה ים Ha-Ym; the waters below (in Assiah and in the Ain Soph), the female part אימה Yama; those above were designated אלהים Elohim (and Aelohim), and distinguished by the first ה Hei in the divine name יהוה; those below (in Assiah and in the Ain Soph) were called אדני ה Adonia, and characterized by the second ה Hei." – Liber Adami</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By following the explanation of Genesis, related with the letter Mem, we find that ראשי בת Bath Rashi, the Prima Dona, the first lady, the daughter of the Abstract Absolute Space, the letter ה Hei, created אלה Elah or Eloha: Remember that the Divine Mother expresses herself in different aspects, so אלה Elah is another aspect of the Divine Mother. אלה Elah is feminine. The Iod and the Mem at the end of אלהים Elohim or אלה-ים Elah Im means sea, so אלה-ים Elah Im means "the Sea Goddess" or the feminine sea: This is hidden in the word Elohim, which means "Gods and Goddesses."</p>
<p>Bereshith ראשי בת Bath Rashi, ים-אלה ברא Bera Elah-Yam can mean "The first daughter created the Sea Goddess in the heavens and the earth."</p>
<p>In Hebrew, the heavens is השמים את At ha shamayim. את At (Aleph and Tav) means "the," yet it also means "you," but feminine. So, in other words, the first daughter created Elah-Yam ים-אלה את At, which is also feminine. השמים Hah Shamayim, the letter ה Hei is also "She."</p>
<p>These are precisely the manifestation of the feminine aspects of divinity. First Bereshith, the Prima Donna, the first lady, the first daughter, ראשי בת Bath Rashi created Elah-Yam At את ים-אלה. This means that אלה-ים the first feminine sea, or Sea Goddess, manifests through the Word, the first and the last letters of the Kabbalistic Alphabet את At, which also means "She." Likewise, the Hei in השמים the heavens, is feminine, you see? She manifests the Word in 'the heavens' because את At means "you," but feminine.</p>
<p>"You" את, Mother, as a Logos, Word, manifests through the ה Hei, the breath, which is the first letter of השמים, "the heavens," which in Hebrew is את השמים At Ha-Shamayim.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...And the Earth</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thereafter, it is written in Hebrew ואת הארץ Ve-At Ha-Arets, which is usually translated to mean "and the earth." Yet we can see that it means "And you [Divine Mother] manifest the Word through the Hei [the breath], in the Earth." The Earth is the sephirah מלכות Malkuth, which begins with מ Mem. The Earth is הארץ Ha-Arets in Hebrew. The sephirah Malkuth is the Earth, and is precisely where She resides; the Divine Mother resides in the whole of nature. Thus the whole phrase:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>בראשית ברא אלהים את השמים ואת הארץ</p>
<p>"The first daughter created Elohim, the heavens, and the earth."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is usually translated as "In the beginning God created the Heavens and the Earth. But really, this first line of the Bible is an complete explanation of how the Divine Mother emerges from the unknowable, and appears as the daughter on the head of God, and creates Elohim, or the Feminine aspect (the Mem) in Heaven and Earth. In other words, She creates through the letter ם Mem in Heaven and through the other letter מ Mem in Earth. This is hidden in that phrase.</p>
<p>Following the narration of Genesis, the next line is,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>והארץ היתה תהו</p>
<p>"And the Earth was formless and void."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This implies that יראש-תב Bath Rashi (the Prime Matter) which emerged from the unknowable divine, the ם final Mem, finally reaches Malkuth, yet its creative power is only in potentiality, since Malkuth, the earth, is formless and void. Everything is within the final Mem, formless and void, meaning, in chaos.</p>
<p>Malkuth represents our physical body, which is also that ם final Mem, yet visible, where everything is formless and void, because Malkuth is the final sephirah, the tenth, of all the emanations that come from the unknowable, from the very bosom or womb of the Divine Mother. We stated that Malkuth is feminine. So the whole physical body is feminine - that is why the physical body, Malkuth, in <a href="https://gnosticteachings.org/faqs/kabbalah.html" >Kabbalah</a> is called מצרים Mitzrahim. We find this word in the Bible translated as "Egypt." It begins with the מ open Mem, and ends with ם final Mem; the two Mems are there in the word Mizrahim.</p>
<p>Every letter of Mizrahim has meaning. In short:</p>
<p>The shape of the letter צ Tzade is made by a bent letter נ Nun that carries a letter י Iod on top. Tzade can translated either as the Latin letter T or Z. Tzade symbolizes the way the righteous one works with the seed, the נ Nun in the spinal column, where we find the power of י Iod in the initiate. So this is why we have to start working with צ Tzade, in order to transmute the נ Nun.</p>
<h2>The Power of Creation</h2>
<p>When we start doing alchemy, then we become a Tzadik or letter Tzade, and we take צ Tzade out from מצרים Mitzrahim, transforming מצרים Mizrahim into the word מרים Miriam - which also begins with the open Mem and ends with the final Mem. מרים Miriam is the Divine Mother, who in the Zohar is the Shechinah. מרים Miriam appears as a sister of משה Moses, whose name also begins with Mem. Miriam was the name of the Mother of Jesus of Nazareth, which is translated as Mary, in English, but in Hebrew is Miriam.</p>
<p>Miriam is Maria, that ocean of life, ocean of water, within which the bent נ Nun is hidden, which is the צ Tzadik, Christ symbolized by Jesus. So Jesus Christ symbolically speaking, the משיח Messiah, which begins with Mem as well, is (in Aramaic) מר יה Lord Jah in Chokmah, the son of מרים Miriam, מריה Maria: Do you see this beautiful symbol of Jesus of Nazareth and Mary? All of this, which unfortunately millions of Christians ignore.</p>
<p>It is impossible to create without the Mem, without the Mother. It is impossible to be alive without מים mayim, water.</p>
<p>Now, when you write ים Yam (sea) backwards, it becomes מי me, meaning "who."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who (מי me) has created these (אלה)." – Isaiah 40:26</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Question: (מי me) WHO created the universe?</p>
<p>Answer: (מי me) WHO created the universe!</p>
<p>When in English we say "me," we address ourselves, yet in Hebrew מי me means "who." It is the same me, or שאר Asher that means also "who" which we extensively explained previously in the lecture about the letter Kaf. In it we said that שאר Asher means "who" or "that," and the word Eheieh Asher Eheieh means "I am who I am," or "I am that which I am." Asher backwards is ראש rosh, meaning "head" in Hebrew. Eheieh Asher Eheieh, "He is who He is." This is an affirmation, but when we question "Who?" then the word is me, מי; the Iod hovers as a wave above the shape of the letter Mem.</p>
<p>So, when in Hebrew we say: "WHO made the universe." We are asserting that Who made it. We are not asking who made it, no, we are asserting that WHO made it. The letters מ Mem and י Iod made it. So when you read the Bible, and this question appears, and says "WHO made these?" You follow the reading, yet you become lost, because you want the answer, yet the answer is in the same question. WHO made the Universe? WHO made it! In Hebrew this is מי me; in other words, the letter מ Mem made it, since within it is the Father which is the letter י Iod, and the Mother which is מ Mem, מים Mayim, water, that is diluted within the Absolute, which is אין AIN, nothing, void. The first letter that we find in the word אין AIN is Aleph, which is the symbol of the wind, the Ruach.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"And the earth was formless and void; and darkness was upon the face of the void. And the Ruach Elohim hovered upon the face of המים Ha-Mayim the waters." – Genesis 1:2</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Aima אימה, mother, is spelled א Aleph (symbol of the spirit, wind), Iod, Mem (ים meaning "sea") and ה Hei at the end (symbol of the Void); אימה Aima means "mother" in Hebrew. So, WHO made the Universe? מי Me made the universe - the letter מ Mem and the letter Iod between the wind א and the void ה.</p>
<p>Ha-Mayim, the waters, is the feminine force expressing herself from the void and hiding the Iod, the masculine force, within her womb. That is precisely how we have all of these powers in the letter מ Mem. The power of the Divine Mem, the Mother, resides within ourselves, hidden in the chakra Muladhara as the Shechinah in exile.</p>
<p>We, ourselves, are the letter מ Mem, physically speaking, but unfortunately we do not see it. Listen, the shape of the letter מ Mem itself is showing us the central nervous system, which is the very womb where the Divine Mother works, the womb shown in the letter מ Mem.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 36pt;">מ</span></p>
<p>Behold the letter מ Mem and see how the central nervous system is shown in the letter, can you see it? Well, you have to see it with the eyes of your heart, with the eyes of the Spirit. As we explained already, the letter כ Kaf relates to the head of God, and as we explained already the letter ו Vav represents the spinal column. So, the letter ו Vav beneath is the spinal medulla and the כ Kaf is the כיפה kippah, skullcap, that covers the brain. Kaf and Vav together form the central nervous system, which is the throne of God. So according to this explanation, the throne of God is the letter Mem.</p>
<p>So the spinal column and the brain is your throne, or better said, is the throne where your inner God has to be seated. The one who has to establish our God on that throne and clean that throne is our Divine Mother; she has to come from the chakra Muladhara (at the base of the spine) and rise to our brain to be united to the Iod in the pineal gland, where the Iod, Shiva, Binah, the Holy Spirit, hovers. Remember, the power of מרים Miriam, the open מ Mem, the Divine Mother, has to rise from the Muladhara chakra, and to reach the ר resh (the head) in order to be united with the י Iod that hovers above the ם final Mem (in other words: מרים = ם + י + ר + מ).</p>
<p>The duality of Binah, the Holy Spirit, is symbolized in מם the two Mems, Father Mother, Abba Aima: This is why the first day of Genesis says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"And the Spirit of the Elohim was hovering upon the face of המים (Ha-Mayim, the Mother, the waters)." – Genesis 1:2</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ha-Mayim המים, the waters—Hei and Mem, and Iod and Mem—between them is the Spirit! That Spirit is the י Iod, between the two מם Mems of מים Mayim, waters. That י Iod is floating between the two מם Mems. That י Iod is the Spirit that is the outcome of Mem. That י Iod is the Spirit of the Elohim, represented in the trinity of the letter א Aleph.</p>
<p>It is written: "And the Spirit of אלה-ים Elah-Yam..."—in other words—"And the Spirit, the Essence of that רחם racham (Womb of Mercy), the Divine Mother; or that אלה-ים Elah-Yam, or that Sea Goddess emanated the י Iod from the א Aleph and became Chesed." The sephirah Chesed is the individual Spirit of each one of us that was hovering upon מים Mayim, the waters.</p>
<p>That Spirit, I repeat, is the outcome of אלה-ים Elah-Yam.</p>
<p>The explanation of אלה-ים Elah-Yam or אלהים Elohim should be in the feminine manner. Elah-Yam (אלה-ים or אלהים) means "the feminine sea, She, the Sea Goddess."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"And Elohim said, Let there be light: and there was light." – Genesis 1:3</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As אלה-ים Elah-Yam, the Sea Goddess, that feminine sea, she said—or better said, אלהים Elohim said through אלה-ים Elah-Yam: "Let there be light!" Yet, that light emerges because of א Aleph, the Spirit, that as a single י Iod is floating above the מ Mem. That י Iod is in the word מצרים Mizrahim, your physical body; the letter י Iod is there. Through <a href="https://gnosticteachings.org/faqs/sex/1664-what-is-chastity.html" >chastity</a>, we transmute that י Iod for it to become איר aur, light. That י Iod is also the Divine Mother; she is also the י Iod of אל שדי El Shaddai, "the Almighty God."</p>
<p>The letter י Iod is at the end of the word שדי Shaddai. It is the Divine Mother, the שכינה Shechinah.</p>
<h2>The Union of the Two Mems</h2>
<p>We can awaken the שכינה Shechinah inside of ourselves by the action of the two מם Mems - the Mem of the man and the Mem of the woman. The Latin M inverted is the W; it is the same M, but inverted. That is why in the sign of Aquarius, the Mem of the man is on top, and the W (the inverted M) is below. The W symbolizes the WO-man in English.￼</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://gnosticteachings-rochen.netdna-ssl.com/images/stories/alefbet/mem/ancient-mem.png" alt="ancient-mem" width="84" height="66" /></p>
<p>But why are we explaining this? Because together the letters M and W form the ancient Hebrew Mem! The above graphic shows how they wrote Mem in ancient times. It is like the M and W that we have in Latin, with which we write woman and man. In this way we can say that the Latin W corresponds to ם final Mem, and the letter M in Latin is the open מ Mem.￼</p>
<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://gnosticteachings-rochen.netdna-ssl.com/images/stories/alefbet/mem/aqarius.png" alt="aqarius" width="84" height="66" /></p>
<p>M and W together form the hieroglyphic of Aquarius, which comes from aqua (water) plus aerius (air, aerial).</p>
<p>When man and woman are united, they form an "Elohim," a combination of male and female that hovers over the waters of sexuality. Through the union of those two polarities (male and female), sexual energy is activated, enflamed, and becomes "light." That light is the שכינה Shechinah, the Divine Mother as light. "And there was light!" That light is the Divine Mother. If we continue talking about this in Genesis, we will see how all of the days of Genesis emerge from her, from that letter Mem.</p>
<p>The second day for instance says, "Let the waters be divided, the superior waters from the inferior waters, in order for the firmament to appear." That firmament emerged from her, because the superior waters are the מ Mem above, that are pouring into the ם Mem below. The מ Mem above is שמים Schamayim, "the Heavens." The ם Mem below is in Malkuth, "the earth."</p>
<p>As we explained in the lecture about א the letter Aleph, the two waters are united in the letter א Aleph, but here in the letter Mem they separate. So when it is written, "And Elohim said, 'Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters," it should say, "Let there be a firmament between the two letters Mem." As well, "let there be a firmament in the womb of the mother, and let us separate מ the superior Mem from ם the inferior Mem - the מ open Mem from the ם Mem Sophit or final Mem - so that the firmament will appear."</p>
<p>￼<img style="float: right; margin-bottom: 30px; margin-left: 30px;" title="Seal of Solomon" src="https://gnosticteachings-rochen.netdna-ssl.com/images/stories/alefbet/mem/Seal-of-Solomon.jpg" alt="Seal of Solomon" width="300" height="419" />As Eliphas Levi shows it in the Seal of Solomon, also called the Star of David, the Father above, and its Shade below, and written in Latin we read: "Quo superior Macroprosopus sicut quo inferior Microprosopus." Meaning, "Let the superior agree with the inferior and the superior agree with the inferior," to make the miracle of one thing. This seal encloses a marvelous work that we should perform in ourselves.</p>
<p>It is written in the marvelous Emerald Tablet that was given by Hermes Trismegistus, the God Mercury. As you see, Mercury begins with the letter Mem. Hermes represents the Mercury, the element water. He wrote the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It is true, no lie, certain, and to be depended upon, the superior (creative waters of Heaven שמים Schamayim) agrees with the inferior (creative waters of Yesod, sex מים Mayim), and the inferior (fire of שכינה Shechinah in the chakra Muladhara agrees) with the superior (fire of the Holy Spirit, in the chakra Sahasrara), to effect that one truly wonderful work (the creation of אדם Adam, Tiphereth). Separate that spirituous earth from the dense or crude by means of a gentle heat, with much attention." - The Emerald Tablet</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Between the two waters—Father in the head and Mother in the sexual organs—is the heart, Adam, as we explained. The Father (Adam Kadmon, Arik Anpin) is in the head. Yet, the Mother, the שכינה Shechinah throughout all of her journey from the Ain Soph, finally reaches מצרים Mizrahim ("Egypt," Malkuth), and that is why it stated that the שכינה Shechinah is in exile. The שכינה Shechinah in exile is that "spirituous earth that must be separated from the dense or crude by means of a gentle heat, with much attention." She has to rise from the bottom of Malkuth to the top of Kether, which is "the crown." When she arises, she brings all of the Sephiroth with her, and purifies them and brings them back to Binah, the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>When the שכינה Shechinah arises:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Her children arise and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praises her." - Proverbs 31:28</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hermes Trismegistus in his Emerald Tablet said that "the superior should agree with the inferior, and the inferior with the superior, to effect the miracle of one thing." That miracle of one thing is the creation of Adam, which is the miracle of miracles, since the whole universe exists because of Adam. He has to be created, that is why the last thing that God made in the Bible, in Genesis, is the creation of Adam on the sixth day. Yet, remember that it is written:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"And Elohim blessed the seventh day (שבת), and sanctified it: because that in it (שבת) he had relied from all his work which Elohim created and made." – Genesis 2:3</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meaning, Elohim created Adam thanks to the seventh day, which is שבת Shabbath, which is שכינה Shechinah, the ש fire of the Divine Mother. Thanks to Malkuth, his בת daughter as well, thanks to the feminine fire of Malkuth that can create Adam in her womb, as it is written:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"And Iod-Havah Elohim formed Adam of the dust of the ground." – Genesis 2:7</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thereafter, Eve was taken out from Adam, and Adam could not control Eve, which is the feminine aspect of Elohim. That is why the woman said unto the serpent:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden: But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden (sex), Elohim hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die." – Genesis 3: 2, 3</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it." We know that the sense of touch relates to the sexual organs. The men in Eden are prohibited to perform the sexual act, because they do not need it. Only by command of Elohim, because Elohim said, "You shall not eat of it, neither shall you touch it!" Nevertheless, Adam ate it and touched it – without God's permission! Adam, the brain, ate and touched sex, the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil, that tree with which Elohim created the universe, which is Mem, Malkuth.</p>
<p>Iod-Havah Elohim was not present when Adam (the brain), ate the fruit. Remember that after the eating of the fruit, Iod-Havah Elohim was looking for Adam,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Where are you!?" – Genesis 3:9</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, Iod-Havah Elohim was not there when Adam (the brain) "ate the fruit." The only one who was there was Elah-Yam, the Divine Mother. Adam took the fruit from her. Kabbalistically speaking, he committed incest, <a href="https://gnosticteachings.org/faqs/sex/1666-what-is-fornication.html" >fornication</a>, and adultery.</p>
<p>So when Iod-Havah Elohim appears, he Kabbalistically says: "So you took the fruit from my wife? You should take it when I am present, not when I am not present."</p>
<p>This still is precisely the problem. When we go into the sexual act, in order to unite the superior with the inferior, we have to understand that the Father, Abba, is in our brain, and the Mother, Aima, is in the sexual organs; these are "Adam and Eve," the two polarities within us. If we go into sex and identify with the sensations of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, which is related with touch, and we forget in our head, Asher Eheieh, "He who is," then we do the sexual act without remembrance of Iod-Havah Elohim. We have to remember in the brain, in the head, in the mind, Iod-Havah Elohim, in order to be in the sexual act with him, in order to "touch his wife," because יהוה אל הים Iod-Havah El-Ha-Yam, the God of the Sea, is capable of controlling אלה-ים Elah-Yam, the Sea Goddess, his wife.</p>
<p>Man and woman united in the sexual act represent Father and Mother: the Elohim, in that very moment. Elah-Yam אלה-ים, the Sea Goddess, is represented in that very moment, in the woman. The man represents יהוה אל הים Iod-Havah El-Ha-Yam, the God of the Sea: Thus, in sex, the two Mems are united.</p>
<p>So now you can clearly see the case of Adam and Eve, who ate from that Tree without the presence of the Father. The Divine Mother on the other hand is in everything: she is in Nature and space; the Divine Mother is in our body. The Divine Mother is the fire of <a href="https://gnosticteachings.org/faqs/spirituality/3100-what-is-kundalini.html" >Kundalini</a> that rises in the spinal column; the Divine Mother <a href="https://gnosticteachings.org/faqs/spirituality/3100-what-is-kundalini.html" >Kundalini</a> gives illumination to Adam in Eden. She is always present within us, and even when we committed the sin of <a href="https://gnosticteachings.org/faqs/sex/1666-what-is-fornication.html" >fornication</a>, the Divine Mother never abandoned us. She coiled three times and a half in the chakra Muladhara and became exiled, waiting for us to awaken her again.</p>
<p>She is חוה Chavah, the Divine חוה Chavah, שכינה Shechinah.</p>
<p>Remember we have to always "wear the hat, the kippah," which reminds us that when we pray, God has to be present. When we perform the sexual act, God has to be present: God the father. We cannot walk four steps by ourselves, without the presence of God, on the path of self-realization.</p>
<h2>Hermes and the Emerald Tablet</h2>
<p>This is how we unite the superior with the inferior, and that is why Hermes said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"As all (sacred) things owe their existence to the will of the only one (Ruach Elohim that hovers up on the face of the superior and inferior Akashic waters), so all (internal or spiritual) things owe their origin to the one only thing, the most hidden (Messiah, the Ain Soph Aur, the Christ, Yehidah, in substance or Mercury of Philosophy), by the arrangement (or better said, by transmutation) of the only (Christonic substance of) God."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What we are explaining here is the Emerald Tablet. Between parenthesis is the alchemical explanation, for you to understand. So Hermes is teaching here that we have to transmute the substance of God in order to perform that miracle, and that substance of God hovers above the waters. That is why Hermes continues,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The father of that one only thing is (INRI, Ignis Natura, Renovatur Integra, the fire, which is the energy of) the sun (the Prana), its mother is the moon (the Akash, which is the שמים Schamayim, the superior cosmic mother, the superior waters), the wind (א Aleph) carries it (as Pranic life) in its belly."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is the belly of the wind? Kabbalistically, what is the belly of א Aleph? Is not the belly in the middle of the body? Observe, the belly that is in the middle of the shape of the letter א Aleph is the letter ו Vav. So, the letter א Aleph carries that power in the letter ו Vav, the spinal column, the Throne of God.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"But its nurse is a spirituous earth. That one only thing is the father of all things in the universe."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Its nurse is the tabernacle of Iod-Chavah, the sexual organs, where our Spiritus Sanctus dwells within the philosophical stone of the earth, Malkuth, the physical body. So the "nurse," in other words, is our physical body. The belly, which is א Aleph, carries that energy in the spinal column, and descends from א Aleph to the sexual organs; we carry that fire in the sexual organs; in our physical body we are nourishing that energy, so we have to transmute it. That "one only thing" is hidden in "the stone which the builders rejected," which is the semen, the Mercury of Philosophy, the same that is "made the head of the corner," the father of all things in the universe.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The stone which the builders rejected is become the head stone of the corner." – Psalm 118:22</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img style="float: right; margin-bottom: 30px; margin-left: 30px;" title="kabbalah on the body" src="https://gnosticteachings-rochen.netdna-ssl.com/images/stories/kabbalah/kabbalah-on-the-body.jpg" alt="kabbalah on the body" width="279" height="600" />That stone is also the Divine Mother. That is why we have said that the Divine Mother is the Iod in שדי Shaddai, which is the holy name of God in the sephirah Yesod (sex).</p>
<p>The "builders" are all of those religious people who read the Bible, the Qu'ran, the Popol Vuh, or any sacred books, and reject sacred sexuality. If they are married, they reject sacred sexuality when they fornicate, when they ejaculate their sexual force.</p>
<p>When we are married, we have to perform sex with our wife or husband, and not eat the fruit - just touch it. In Eden they said to not even touch it, but here we are not in Eden, so now we have to touch it but not eat it! Transmute it.</p>
<p>The rest of the other "builders" who reject the stone are the celibate people who think they can Self-realize without sexual cooperation with the opposite sex. It is not possible. Self-realization emerges between the two Mems. Therefore, those who reject the Divine Mother, who do not even worship her – who think that the universe was created, or think that they were created only by a man, are dimwits who ignore that all of us came from the womb of our mother. We were there for nine months, so without the woman, God cannot create. If they want to be born again, they need to transmute the energy from their body, because the mother is the creator of all things in the universe.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Its power is perfect, after it has been united to a spirituous earth."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The divine creative power of Binah remains perfect after it has been sexually united with the Spiritus Sanctus, the שכינה Shechinah in Malkuth, the earth. This is the union of the essence, the <a href="https://gnosticteachings.org/glossary/s/2890-soul.html" >soul</a> of the sperm and the ovum, which is the philosophical stone, sex in the perfect matrimony.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Separate that spirituous earth from the dense or crude by means of a gentle heat, with much attention."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Separate that Spritus Sanctus, that holy fire of Malkuth שכינה Shechinah. We have to "separate" it, or sublimate that Spirit from the earth, from the dense fluidic sexual matter, or crude brute Mercury, by means of sexual transmutation, or Sahaja Maithuna, "by means of a gentle heat," meaning without passion. Just a little bit, gentle in the sexual act. "With much attention," meaning by remembering God, praying to the Father in the head, paying attention, being aware of God; because if you want to do it just by yourself, you will not succeed. God has to be present there.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In great measure it ascends from the earth up to heaven, and descends again, newborn, on the earth, and the superior and the inferior are increased in power."</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img style="float: right; margin-bottom: 20px; margin-left: 20px;" title="kabbalah, the tree of life" src="https://gnosticteachings-rochen.netdna-ssl.com/images/stories/kabbalah/kabbalah-the-tree-of-life.png" alt="kabbalah, the tree of life" width="225" height="525" />"In great measure," this holy fire of <a href="https://gnosticteachings.org/faqs/spirituality/3100-what-is-kundalini.html" >Kundalini</a> ascends as the fire of שכינה Shechinah, from the sexual waters of Yesod (sex), through the spinal medulla of the earth, which is Malkuth. After Kether (which is our Monad in heaven) through <a href="https://gnosticteachings.org/faqs/initiation.html" >initiation</a> it descends again as the Son of God, a newborn of the water and the fire, like Moses, on the earth, which is the physical body.</p>
<p>The superior sephiroth Kether, Chokmah, and Binah, and the inferior sephiroth Gedulah, Geburah, Tiphereth, Hod, Yesod, and Malkuth, are "increased in power." The whole Tree of Life within us receives power.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"By this (sexual transmutation) thou wilt partake of the honors (glory of the Ain Soph Aur, the Solar Light) of the whole world and darkness (ignorance) will fly from thee."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You might ask: How do we understand all of this? By doing it! Thus, if you start transmuting, doing what Hermes Trismegistus advised, ignorance will flee from you and light will emerge. That light is שכינה Shechinah, the Divine Mother, who will enlighten you, because the Divine Mother, Myriam, is that light of שכינה Shechinah, and without that Light you cannot be born again, because Jesus was the son of Myriam and of the Holy Spirit, as it is written.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God." – Luke 1:35</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Holy Spirit is in the pineal gland, the superior Mem, and Myriam is Malkuth. By uniting the superior and inferior waters, Jesus appears as a fire in the spinal column and lives 33 vertebrae or "33 years." You see, that is Yehidah, the משיח Messiah. The light does not come from outside of you, it comes from within you. This is how the Savior is born. This is the light of the fire, the <a href="https://gnosticteachings.org/faqs/spirituality/3100-what-is-kundalini.html" >Kundalini</a>, which in Latin is called Lucifer, "the carrier (fer) of light (luce)," the sexual potency, the Cherub.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"This is the strength of all powers. With this (White <a href="https://gnosticteachings.org/faqs/sex/1675-what-is-tantra.html" >Tantra</a>) thou wilt be able to overcome all (karmic) things, and to transmute all what is fine and what is coarse (within your psyche)."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When we perform this White <a href="https://gnosticteachings.org/faqs/sex/1675-what-is-tantra.html" >Tantra</a>, the transformation of all the forces in our psyche comes as we explained in other lectures. First, appears Abraham, then Isaac, then Jacob, and then Moses appears within you. Then you see God face to face, and then you understand why only Moses can see God face to face; yet, Moses has to be born within you. Moses is born from Miriam, the waters. This is why Moses was found in the Nile floating on the waters, and that is why משה Moses means "born of water and fire," which is ש Shin.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In this manner (by means of sexual transmutation, Bereshith) the world was created; the arrangements to follow this road are hidden (within the נ Nun, which is sperm and ovum: your sexual energy).</p>
<p>"For this reason I am called Hermes Trismegistus; One in Essence but Three in Aspect."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The trinity is:</p>
<ol>
<li>The brute mercury, which is the sperm and the ovum</li>
<li>The <a href="https://gnosticteachings.org/glossary/s/2890-soul.html" >soul</a> of the mercury, which is the fire of שכינה Shechinah rising through Ida and Pingala</li>
<li>The Mercury fecundated by the sulfur, which is when that energy rises within the spinal column and is united with Binah, the Holy Spirit</li>
</ol>
<p>When Miriam and the Holy Spirit are united in the Mercury (the Water, the Mem), Jesus appears within you. Your own particular Jesus Christ appears within you, the משיח Messiah, which is the mercury fecundated by sulfur. Within Him is hidden the wisdom of the whole world. Wisdom in Hebrew is Chokmah, the second aspect of the trinity, the Son, wisdom, Chokmah.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In this trinity is hidden the wisdom of the whole world (within all that we explained is hidden Chokmah, wisdom; the Messiah). It is ended now, what I have said concerning the effects of the sun (the Solar Christ; the Solar Absolute). Finish of the Tabula Smaragdina by Hermes Trismegistus."</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The Thirteenth Commandment</h2>
<p>All of this quotation from the Emerald Tablet is related with the two Mems, the whole work that we have to perform, and it does not end here, because remember that the letter Mem, the thirteenth letter, relates to the thirteenth commandment. How many commandments are there? 22. The Zohar says that Moses only delivered thirteen. Then why only ten are in the bible? The thirteenth and the rest of them are there, but you have to see them with the eyes of Spirit, with your heart, when you are an initiate.</p>
<p>The eleventh commandment is 11: 1 and 1, the two tablets of the Law; those two tablets of the Law are man and woman. The Divine Adam is represented in Kether, Chokmah, Binah, Chesed, Geburah, the first 5 commandments. From Tiphereth to Malkuth appears the wife of God: the sephiroth Tiphereth, Netzach, Hod, Yesod, Malkuth. Malkuth is the woman. Mem is the woman. So one tablet is the man and the other tablet is the woman. That is the synthesis of the eleventh commandment. When man and woman are sexually united in <a href="https://gnosticteachings.org/faqs/sex/1664-what-is-chastity.html" >chastity</a>, they work with the ten commandments. When they are sexually united in <a href="https://gnosticteachings.org/faqs/sex/1664-what-is-chastity.html" >chastity</a> they are doing their duty, that is they are accomplishing the eleventh commandment: "Do thy duty." Our duty is to attain the realization of the Self through the performance of the sexual act in <a href="https://gnosticteachings.org/faqs/sex/1664-what-is-chastity.html" >chastity</a>, that is, to give birth to Adam through Christ within us.</p>
<p>This is why it is written that when man and woman transmute their sexual energy in the holy matrimony, they awaken the fire of Shechinah. Through this awakening, they accomplish the twelfth commandment: "Make thy light shine." That light is hidden within the Muladhara chakra at the base of the spine. When that light rises, then that which is written happens: "Let there be light." That light of the twelfth commandment gives you understanding of the ten commandments.</p>
<p>The eleventh and twelfth commandments relate to the sexual union of man and woman, the two Mems of the sign of Aquarius.</p>
<p>What happens after this accomplishment, that is, after they do their duty and after they make their light shine? They then have to accomplish the thirteenth commandment. What is the thirteenth commandment? The Zohar says it is the reciting of the Shema.</p>
<p>שמע Shema in Hebrew means "hear." Shema refers to a passage of scripture used as a <a href="https://gnosticteachings.org/faqs/prayers.html" >prayer</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Hear, O Israel: יהוה our אלהים Elohim is one יהוה: And thou shall love יהוה thy אלהים Elohim with all thine heart, and with all thy <a href="https://gnosticteachings.org/glossary/s/2890-soul.html" >soul</a>, and with all thy might. And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in thine heart." – Deuteronomy 6:4-6</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In <a href="https://gnosticteachings.org/faqs/kabbalah.html" >Kabbalah</a>, "Israel" symbolizes the spiritual archetypes we need to develop. So, when we understand this, as we explained in the beginning, יהוה Iod-Hei-Vav-Hei is Father, Son, Holy Spirit and the Ain Soph, forming the four letters of the Holy Name of God; that is Yehidah, the Unity of God inside us. Israel represents all the twelve parts (the archetypes of Israel) that we have within: twelve parts that are below, in the Mem below, and twelve parts that are in the Mem above. The twelve parts of the Mem above are the twelve zodiacal signs or constellations that abide in the womb of Mother Space, because Mother Space contains the twelve constellations; these are the twelve archetypes above. The twelve archetypes below are within our body. There are twelve above and twelve below, the two Mems, two waters, inferior and superior, with the Iod between them.</p>
<p><img src="https://gnosticteachings-rochen.netdna-ssl.com/images/stories/tarot/a24.png" width="158" height="300" alt="Arcanum Twenty-four, The Weaver" title="Arcanum Twenty-four, The Weaver" style="float: right; margin-bottom: 30px; margin-left: 30px;" />If we make the addition, twelve above and twelve below, we have twenty-four. The Tarot card twenty-four is The Weaver. The Weaver is the Divine Mother, weaving on the womb of God. In other words, the Divine Mother is uniting the superior waters with the inferior waters within her godly womb. This is why it is stated that the twenty-four elders of Revelation are before the throne of God. Twenty-four parts: twelve above, twelve below, related with the twelve tribes, the twelve apostles, the Great Work that we have to perform. This is why it is written:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, 'Which is the main commandment of all?'</p>
<p>"And Jesus answered him, 'The main of all the commandments is: Hear, O Israel: יהוה our אלהים Elohim is one יהוה: And thou shall love יהוה thy אלהים Elohim with all thine heart (Iod), and with all thy <a href="https://gnosticteachings.org/glossary/s/2890-soul.html" >soul</a> (Hei), and with all thy mind (Vav), and with all thy strength (Hei).</p>
<p>"'And the second main one is like the first, namely: Thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself. There is none other commandment greater than these.'" – Mark 12:28-31</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As we read, these are four statements, because Iod-Hei-Vav-Hei is one. What are those four aspects in order for you to accomplish the foremost commandment? You accomplish it when you recite the שמע Shema, which is the thirteenth commandment.</p>
<p><img src="https://gnosticteachings-rochen.netdna-ssl.com/images/stories/tarot/a13.png" width="158" height="300" alt="Arcanum Thirteen, Immortality" title="Arcanum Thirteen, Immortality" style="float: left; margin-right: 30px; margin-bottom: 30px;" />Thirteen means the accomplishment of death, because the number thirteen is related with death. We have to die in יהו Iod-Hei-Vav, our three brains—our intellectual, emotional and motor-instinctual-sexual brains. The second ה Hei of the Holy Name יהוה is hidden, because it is the power of the Ain Soph, the Absolute; it is the power of שכינה Shechinah, which is before or behind the three brains or three primary forces, which relate to the work that we are doing. In other words, we work with the three brains, the three primary forces, but before those three brains is the ה Hei, the power of שכינה Shechinah, the Divine Mother, the feminine aspect of Binah (understanding, comprehension) through the three brains.</p>
<p>This is why The Zohar says that the thirteenth commandment is the reciting of the שמע Shema, meaning the performance of what we are explaining here. This does not mean that we have to physically recite: "Hear O Israel, Iod-Chavah, our Elohim is our Iod-Chavah, etc," and that is all, no!</p>
<p>Listen, in order to love our inner God "with all our heart, and with all our <a href="https://gnosticteachings.org/glossary/s/2890-soul.html" >soul</a>, and with all our mind, and with all our strength," we have to die in our sins. In order to "love our neighbor as our Self," we have to sacrifice ourselves for humanity, to love our enemies. This means that we have to psychologically die in the three brains and to help others.</p>
<p>These are the two main commandments: "You shall love your inner God, and second your neighbor as your Self." There is no other commandment greater than these.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none other but he: And to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the <a href="https://gnosticteachings.org/glossary/s/2890-soul.html" >soul</a>, and with all the strength, and to love God's neighbor as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices. And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God." – Mark 12: 32, 33</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, if we accomplish the thirteenth commandment, we are not far from the Kingdom of God. This means that it is not enough to be married and transmute the sexual energy and to awaken the <a href="https://gnosticteachings.org/faqs/spirituality/3100-what-is-kundalini.html" >Kundalini</a>; we have to "perform the שמע Shema," which is that commandment that is the first, meaning, the main one, since it relates to the thirteenth letter: Mem. The letter Mem explains the meaning of the thirteenth commandment: 1 + 3 = 4: the Tetragrammaton.</p>
<p>Iod-Hei-Vav-Hei, יהוה Iod-Chavah, the Tetragrammaton, accomplishes all of that in us. יהוה is inside us, יהוה is hidden within the three brains. The intellectual brain is י Iod. The emotional brain is ה Hei. The motor-instinctual-sexual brain is ו Vav and behind all these is ה the Divine Mother, the Light of the Absolute. We have to meditate, to comprehend, and understand that the ה Hei behind the three brains is comprehension, understanding, which is what we have to acquire. Remember what Hermes said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Separate that spirituous earth from the dense or crude by means of a gentle heat, with much attention."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is to transmute what is fine and what is coarse. What is fine are those elements, archetypes, that we have within. What is coarse are all those defects that we have, which are "the seven capital sins" that we have to transform into virtues. This is only accomplished by entering the womb of the Divine Mother: the central nervous system.</p>
<p>When we close our eyes and meditate, we enter the central nervous system and discover our seven chakras, and the seven levels of our spinal column. Remember that Adam has seven bodies; seven multiplied by seven equals forty-nine levels.</p>
<p>In order to transmute what is fine and what is coarse, we begin with the defects that we see in our physical body, in the seven levels of our physicality. Later, we have to go beyond Malkuth (physicality), into Yesod, the Vital Body, then Hod, the Astral Body, and then Netzach, Tiphereth, Geburah, and Chesed to accomplish all seven.</p>
<p>This transformation of the coarse aspect of our psyche cannot be done just with physical perception. This implies to submerge within ourselves in <a href="https://gnosticteachings.org/faqs/meditation.html" >meditation</a> and to reach all those levels through <a href="https://gnosticteachings.org/faqs/initiation.html" >Initiation</a> in order to accomplish "the miracle of one thing," which is the creation of Adam in the image of God. All of this transformation is made with the Divine Mother.</p>
<p>You cannot be born again without מ Mem, Maia, Aima-Elohim. It is impossible to be born again without the Divine Mother.</p>
<p>Nobody can die without the מ Mem, because death in Hebrew is מוות mavet, which begins with Mem. So you have to pray to Divine Mother Death, מוות mavet, in order to annihilate all the impurities that we have within.</p>
<p>That is why Mem is in the word סמאל Samael, because he teaches מוות mavet, the death of the <a href="https://gnosticteachings.org/faqs/psychology/1761-what-is-ego.html" >ego</a>, the annihilation of our sins through מ, the thirteenth letter, which is the letter that resounds in the chakra Swadhistana, the chakra of the uterus or prostrate.</p>
<p>Without the Divine Mother, without the enlightenment of שכינה Shechinah, we cannot understand the teachings. What we understand of the teachings is thanks to our Divine Mother. Without her, we would be lost. Without שכינה Shechinah, we would be lost.</p>
<p>Only she can give us enlightenment, if we do the work related with thirteen, which is related with her, מוות mavet, death, to annihilate the <a href="https://gnosticteachings.org/faqs/psychology/1761-what-is-ego.html" >ego</a> in order to establish the thirteen Aeons in ourselves, which are the thirteen sephiroth from Malkuth to the Ain, which are the thirteen attributes of mercy in the head of Adam Kadmon, in the head of God, thirteen curls of hair that symbolize the thirteen emanations from the Divine Mother, with the letter מ Mem. Without מ Mem, without the Mother, Maria, Maya, we cannot do it. Without Miriam, it is impossible to attain that development within ourselves.</p>
<p>This is why we state that the Divine Mother, the letter מ M, hides all of that within us. Thanks to Her, we have this knowledge. The whole knowledge emerges from Her. At the end of the self-realization, as the Divine Mother sprouted from the head of God in the beginning of Genesis, it also has to sprout from our head. When that head opens in the initiate, then the Divine Mother appears triumphant as Minerva, the Goddess of Wisdom, the Goddess of Chokmah. For that to happen, we have to take care of Her.</p>
<p>This is why religious people put a hat on their head, in order to hide the Light of the שכינה Shechinah. That hat is symbolic. It does not mean that all of those who use the hat hide the שכינה Shechinah, because they do not even know what the שכינה Shechinah is, since they are fornicators.</p>
<p>Only initiates can awaken the שכינה Shechinah, like the fire of the Pentecost which comes out of the head of the Apostles. That tongue of fire is the שכינה Shechinah.</p>
<p>When you develop Minerva, you have returned Pistis Sophia from the Abyss and put her in the thirteenth Aeon, because the Divine Mother belongs to the thirteenth Aeon.</p>
<p>That force of שכינה Shechinah is what we call Pistis Sophia, which descends and goes up.</p>
<p>That force of שכינה Shechinah is the fire that shone from the head of Moses, that fire that descends from Mount Sinai and delivers the commandments.</p>
<p>Likewise, the Divine Mother has to shine in our head. She has to come from the head of Jupiter with a sword in her hand. That is the sword of justice.</p>

<h3>Questions and Answers</h3>
<p>Audience: Can you explain the hats used by different religious people?</p>
<p>Instructor: All shapes of hats or head coverings that you find in religions symbolize the hidden knowledge. When we uncover our head and talk, this means that we are uncovering the truth, showing our wisdom. When we cover it, in the sense given in this lecture, it means that we are covering our wisdom. We have to know how to shine for others, how to make our light shine in different degrees; this is Mastery.</p>
<p>Audience: Can single people have the light of שכינה Shechinah like married people?"</p>
<p>Instructor: When Hermes Trismegistus said, "And darkness (ignorance) will flee from thee" it does not mean that we will awaken the <a href="https://gnosticteachings.org/faqs/spirituality/3100-what-is-kundalini.html" >Kundalini</a>, the שכינה Shechinah, in the first night with our spouse and immediately become enlightened. It does not happen like that. It happens in degrees, through gradual Initiations. There are nine Initiations of Minor Mysteries in which darkness (ignorance) flees from a single person. When the nine Initiations of Minor Mysteries are complete, then to fulfill more initiations the single person has to marry so that all the darkness related with the Major Mysteries will flee from him/her. That is the upper darkness, related to שכינה Shechinah; this is when we need a spouse, and to transmute the sexual energy in order to awaken the mercury fecundated by sulfur. That is Jesus, the Messiah, that appears within our spine and ejects all the darkness (ignorance), in degrees through the eight Venustic Initiations and through the accomplishment of the thirteenth commandment, which is death. When we are completely psychologically dead, when there is not a single <a href="https://gnosticteachings.org/faqs/psychology/1761-what-is-ego.html" >ego</a> in us, when we are 100% clean, therefore ignorance has fled from us. This is when we are a completely illuminated Master.</p>
<p>Audience: What Genesis states, "Let there be light and there was light" does this refer only to the Divine Mother?</p>
<p>Instructor: When Genesis states, "Let there be light," the one that is saying it is the Father in the sexual act, the masculine aspect. When it is written "And there was light," it is the feminine aspect. It is like when a male says, "I want to have a son," and then he impregnates his wife, and then his wife is pregnant, and his wife says "And here is the son." In other words, when we are in the sexual act, remembering Kether, the Father, and transmuting our sexual energy, he says "Let there be Light" we then transmute and the energy emerges from the Muladhara chakra saying, "And there was Light," your Divine Mother, but she has to rise from the bottom of the Muladhara to your pineal gland. This is a slow, gradual work, not a work of one night. Some take many years in one <a href="https://gnosticteachings.org/faqs/initiation.html" >initiation</a>.</p>
<p>When she reaches the pineal gland (in the brain) as the <a href="https://gnosticteachings.org/faqs/spirituality/3100-what-is-kundalini.html" >Kundalini</a>, then that first <a href="https://gnosticteachings.org/faqs/initiation.html" >Initiation</a> is made, which is יום אחד Yom Ehad, the first day.</p>
<p>The word יום means "day." At the end of יום Yom is the letter ם Mem, and at the beginning is the י Iod. Together, Iod and Mem are ים which means "sea, the ocean." The ו Vav is your spinal column. When it is between Iod and Mem, than you are saying Yom. The first letter, י, represents the sephirah Yesod. The ו Vav is your spinal column.The ם Mem final represents the pineal gland. Thus is the first YOM, the first <a href="https://gnosticteachings.org/faqs/initiation.html" >Initiation</a> of Major Mysteries.</p>
<p>Each day represents spiritual knowledge hidden in the Bible, which relates to the Initiations. Yom does not mean a literal day of twenty-four hours.</p>
<p>We have to accomplish seven Yoms, seven Initiations.</p>
<p>Audience: You were speaking of the twelve above and the twelve below...</p>
<p>Instructor: The twelve above are the twelve aspects of שכינה Shechinah in the superior waters of Heaven, which are related with the twelve constellations from Aries to Pisces. Those twelve constellations are from the twelve powers of the Divine Mother Space. All of these powers are within us. Parts of them, as archetypes, descend into the physical body. This is why we are born in a different zodiacal sign in every life in accordance to the law of reincarnation. So the twelve archetypes, or the twelve tribes of Israel, are within us. By accomplishing the transmutation of the superior and inferior waters, we unite the twelve and twelve, and then we find the twenty-fourth Arcanum, The Weaver, which is the Divine Mother uniting the waters from above and below in order to "perform the miracle of one thing," the creation of her Son, Adam. That is the mystery, yet it is more profound.</p>
<p>Audience: In the book <a href="https://gnosticteachings.org/books-by-samael-aun-weor/treatise-of-revolutionary-psychology.html">Revolutionary Psychology</a>, Samael Aun Weor said, "Who are we?" Does this refer to 'Me and Asher' which is 'Who' in <a href="https://gnosticteachings.org/faqs/kabbalah.html" >Kabbalah</a>?</p>
<p>Instructor: All the books of Master Samael Aun Weor are 100% Kabbalistic and he said not to read his books like a newspaper. "Who are we?" he says in <a href="https://gnosticteachings.org/books-by-samael-aun-weor/treatise-of-revolutionary-psychology.html">Revolutionary Psychology</a>. He is asking us, and we are answering "We are Who (מי me)." "Who" is the Real Being within us, Binah, Mercury, because Binah is the God Mercury, Shiva, the first begotten of Space, our own particular Monad. He is "Who." So who are we? We are Who, but we are saying it only intellectually. The main thing is to discover that consciously.</p>
<p>The Mayans say, "Who are we?" Then they say, "Are we that which we are? Am I what I am?"</p>
<p>The question is: "Are you what you are?" If Who (מי me) is Binah, the Holy Spirit, who are we? Our real Being is God, the Holy Spirit. Are we that? No! That is why the Mayan Kabbalists say, "Am I the one that I am?" Do you see the question here? This is very profound.</p>
<p>The answer, if you honestly answer it, is No! We are not Who! We have to reach the thirteenth commandment; we have to die in our many selves in order to become what I am. Because "I am" is: Eheieh Asher Eheieh, the Monad, and if we accomplish Self-realization, then we will be That. Before that we are not, yet we are part of it.</p>
<p>Remember, the Divine Mother is with us, even if she is not awakened yet, she is with us. We have to awake her. When we pray to our Divine Mother, "Please, Mother of mine, help me with this and that," you are talking to that divine aspect, which is called Elah-Yam. But she wants to be IN you. When you awaken her inside yourself, then she rises inside your spinal column as שכינה Shechinah, then she is within you. Then we are happy, because we find Abraham and Sarah united, or Isaac and Rebecca united, or Jacob and Rachel. The Divine Mother there inside of you is the <a href="https://gnosticteachings.org/faqs/spirituality/3100-what-is-kundalini.html" >Kundalini</a>, the שכינה Shechinah in different levels in accordance with <a href="https://gnosticteachings.org/faqs/initiation.html" >Initiation</a>, so we have to develop the Divine Mother within us: Mem.</p>
<p>Audience: In some traditions the number thirteen is bad luck; can you expose more about it?</p>
<p>Instructor: Well, the number thirteen is bad luck for the <a href="https://gnosticteachings.org/faqs/psychology/1761-what-is-ego.html" >ego</a>, but good luck for the Being, that's for sure! Friday the 13th is a tradition in English. Friday is Freya, the Goddess of Love, the Divine Mother in The Edda, the Nordic myth, from there comes the word "Friday." So, Friday the 13th is related with Mem, mavet, death. Everyone is scared of death. Everyone is scared of dying, right? We have to be happy to die. We have to welcome death. We need to die. "My beloved Mother Death, come to me, kill me." She only kills the devils that are inside you. She cannot kill your <a href="https://gnosticteachings.org/glossary/s/2890-soul.html" >soul</a>. She cannot destroy your Being, because those elements are immortal. Your egos are not immortal, so she can destroy them, so invite her on Good Friday, the thirteenth, the beginning of Shabbath, invite her to kill your <a href="https://gnosticteachings.org/faqs/psychology/1761-what-is-ego.html" >ego</a>.</p>
<p>If you do not want her to kill you here, then she will kill you in hell, because she does not abandon her son or daughter. In the eighth Dantesque circle, she becomes a viper in order to destroy that <a href="https://gnosticteachings.org/faqs/psychology/1761-what-is-ego.html" >ego</a> in order to liberate her son, her <a href="https://gnosticteachings.org/glossary/s/2890-soul.html" >soul</a>, her daughter from hell.</p>
<p>Audience: In South America it is Tuesday the 13th...</p>
<p>Instructor: In South America they say Tuesday the 13th, but it makes more sense as Friday the 13th, because Tuesday is related with Thor. It might also have the same sense, since Thor is the Holy Spirit, Binah, from which the thunder comes.</p>
<p>Audience: Should we be looking at the books in Spanish in order to understand the books more Kabbalistically?</p>
<p>Instructor: Whether it is in Spanish, English, Chinese, French, Portuguese or any other language, when we say "Who are we?" it is the same question.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://gnosticteachings.org/faqs/kabbalah.html" >Kabbalah</a>, מי me is "who." That מי me is the Holy Spirit, the reality within us. Shiva, Mercury, the first begotten; the Monad – that is the reality within us. That is מי me in <a href="https://gnosticteachings.org/faqs/kabbalah.html" >Kabbalah</a>. Thus, whether we interpret the <a href="https://gnosticteachings.org/faqs/kabbalah.html" >Kabbalah</a> in Spanish or in Portuguese or any other language, we always have to go to the source of the bible, which is written in Hebrew. Understand?</p>
<p>Audience: What would be a good practice to do for Mother's Day?</p>
<p>Instructor: Tomorrow is Mother's Day, the tenth of May. You think it is a coincidence? Tomorrow is the tenth. What is tomorrow? 10, IO, the I is the phallus, the man, and the O is the uterus, the woman. As you see, the letter ם final Mem has the shape of the letter O. And the letter Iod which is on the top left is the letter I. IO. IO is Mem.</p>
<p>May is the month of the mother. Tomorrow is Mother's Day. Kabbalistically, it is a very beautiful day. It is the only modern holiday that I see is placed in the right place from a Kabbalistic point of view.</p>
<p>The Divine Mother is in all the practices. She is in <a href="https://gnosticteachings.org/faqs/sex/1674-what-is-sexual-magic.html" >Sexual Magic</a> and <a href="https://gnosticteachings.org/faqs/sex/1672-what-is-pranayama.html" >Pranayama</a>. She is everywhere. If you want to find a practice where the Divine Mother is not there, then that practice is not good. She has to be present in all practices. In all the practices that we do, she is there, because she is the Light of God. Not even God can exist without the Mother. He, God, masculine, emerged from the womb of Mother Space, which is Soph in Hebrew, the שכינה Shechinah unmanifested, and from the head emanates the daughter, which is She. So, any spiritual practice is good.</p>
<p>Remember Her, love Her, and remember that She is always within you. That is the best practice, to give all your love to Her.</p>
<p>Honor your Mother and your Father who are within you.</p>
<p>Practice the <a href="https://gnosticteachings.org/faqs/prayers.html" >mantra</a> ISIS, pronounced,</p>
<p>IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII SSSSSSSSSSSSSS IIIIIIIIIII SSSSSSSSSSSS</p>
<p>Put your arms straight above your head, making the Latin letter "I" with your body. Point your fingers to heaven, straight, and in that position pronounce ISIS. This is a simple practice that you can perform every day.</p>
<p>Have a happy Mother's Day.</p><ul class="pagenav"><li class="pagenav-prev">&lt; <span class="pagenav-prev-pretext">Previous: </span><a href="https://gnosticteachings.org/courses/alphabet-of-kabbalah/739-lamed.html" rel="next">ל Lamed</a></li><li class="pagenav-next"><span class="pagenav-next-pretext">Next: </span><a href="745-nun.html" rel="prev">נ Nun</a> &gt;</li>
