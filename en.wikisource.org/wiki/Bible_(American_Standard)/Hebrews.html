<p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:1"><sup>1</sup></span> God, having of old time spoken unto the fathers in the
prophets by divers portions and in divers manners, 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:2"><sup>2</sup></span> hath at
the end of these days spoken unto us in [his] Son, whom he
appointed heir of all things, through whom also he made the
worlds; 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:3"><sup>3</sup></span> who being the effulgence of his glory, and the
very image of his substance, and upholding all things by the
word of his power, when he had made purification of sins, sat
down on the right hand of the Majesty on high; 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:4"><sup>4</sup></span> having
become by so much better than the angels, as he hath inherited a
more excellent name than they. 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:5"><sup>5</sup></span> For unto which of the
angels said he at any time,
Thou art my Son,
This day have I begotten thee?
and again,
I will be to him a Father,
And he shall be to me a Son?
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:6"><sup>6</sup></span> And when he again bringeth in the firstborn into the
world he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him. 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:7"><sup>7</sup></span> And of the angels he saith,
Who maketh his angels winds,
And his ministers a flame a fire:
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:8"><sup>8</sup></span> but of the Son [he saith,]
Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever;
And the sceptre of uprightness is the sceptre of thy kingdom.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:9"><sup>9</sup></span> Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity;
Therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee
With the oil of gladness above thy fellows.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:10"><sup>10</sup></span> And,
Thou, Lord, in the beginning didst lay the foundation of the
earth,
And the heavens are the works of thy hands:
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:11"><sup>11</sup></span> They shall perish; but thou continuest:
And they all shall wax old as doth a garment;
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:12"><sup>12</sup></span> And as a mantle shalt thou roll them up,
As a garment, and they shall be changed:
But thou art the same,
And thy years shall not fail.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:13"><sup>13</sup></span> But of which of the angels hath he said at any time,
Sit thou on my right hand,
Till I make thine enemies the footstool of thy feet?
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:14"><sup>14</sup></span> Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to do
service for the sake of them that shall inherit salvation?

<p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:1"><sup>1</sup></span> Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the
things that were heard, lest haply we drift away [from them].
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:2"><sup>2</sup></span> For if the word spoken through angels proved stedfast, and
every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense
of reward; 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:3"><sup>3</sup></span> how shall we escape, if we neglect so great a
salvation? which having at the first been spoken through the
Lord, was confirmed unto us by them that heard; 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:4"><sup>4</sup></span> God also
bearing witness with them, both by signs and wonders, and by
manifold powers, and by gifts of the Holy Spirit, according to
his own will. 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:5"><sup>5</sup></span> For not unto angels did he subject the world
to come, whereof we speak. 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:6"><sup>6</sup></span> But one hath somewhere
testified, saying,
What is man, that thou art mindful of him?
Or the son of man, that thou visitest him?
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:7"><sup>7</sup></span> Thou madest him a little lower than the angels;
Thou crownedst him with glory and honor,
And didst set him over the works of thy hands:
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:8"><sup>8</sup></span> Thou didst put all things in subjection under his feet.
For in that he subjected all things unto him, he left nothing
that is not subject to him. But now we see not yet all things
subjected to him. 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:9"><sup>9</sup></span> But we behold him who hath been made a
little lower than the angels, [even] Jesus, because of the
suffering of death crowned with glory and honor, that by the
grace of God he should taste of death for every [man]. 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:10"><sup>10</sup></span> For it became him, for whom are all things, and through whom are
all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the author
of their salvation perfect through sufferings. 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:11"><sup>11</sup></span> For both
he that sanctifieth and they that are sanctified are all of one:
for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren, 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:12"><sup>12</sup></span> saying,
I will declare thy name unto my brethren,
In the midst of the congregation will I sing thy praise.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:13"><sup>13</sup></span> And again, I will put my trust in him. And again,
Behold, I and the children whom God hath given me. 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:14"><sup>14</sup></span> Since
then the children are sharers in flesh and blood, he also
himself in like manner partook of the same; that through death
he might bring to nought him that had the power of death, that
is, the devil; 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:15"><sup>15</sup></span> and might deliver all them who through
fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage. 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:16"><sup>16</sup></span> For verily not to angels doth he give help, but he giveth help
to the seed of Abraham. 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:17"><sup>17</sup></span> Wherefore it behooved him in all
things to be made like unto his brethren, that he might become a
merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God,
to make propitiation for the sins of the people. 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:18"><sup>18</sup></span> For in
that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able to
succor them that are tempted.

<p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:1"><sup>1</sup></span> Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of a heavenly
calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession,
[even] Jesus; 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:2"><sup>2</sup></span> who was faithful to him that appointed him,
as also was Moses in all his house. 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:3"><sup>3</sup></span> For he hath been
counted worthy of more glory than Moses, by so much as he that
built the house hath more honor than the house. 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:4"><sup>4</sup></span> For every
house is builded by some one; but he that built all things is
God. 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:5"><sup>5</sup></span> And Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a
servant, for a testimony of those things which were afterward to
be spoken; 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:6"><sup>6</sup></span> but Christ as a son, over his house; whose
house are we, if we hold fast our boldness and the glorying of
our hope firm unto the end. 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:7"><sup>7</sup></span> Wherefore, even as the Holy
Spirit saith,
To-day if ye shall hear his voice,
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:8"><sup>8</sup></span> Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation,
Like as in the day of the trial in the wilderness,
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:9"><sup>9</sup></span> Where your fathers tried [me] by proving [me,]
And saw my works forty years.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:10"><sup>10</sup></span> Wherefore I was displeased with this generation,
And said, They do always err in their heart:
But they did not know my ways;
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:11"><sup>11</sup></span> As I sware in my wrath,
They shall not enter into my rest.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:12"><sup>12</sup></span> Take heed, brethren, lest haply there shall be in any
one of you an evil heart of unbelief, in falling away from the
living God: 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:13"><sup>13</sup></span> but exhort one another day by day, so long as
it is called To-day; lest any one of you be hardened by the
deceitfulness of sin: 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:14"><sup>14</sup></span> for we are become partakers of
Christ, if we hold fast the beginning of our confidence firm
unto the end: 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:15"><sup>15</sup></span> while it is said,
To-day if ye shall hear his voice,
Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:16"><sup>16</sup></span> For who, when they heard, did provoke? nay, did not
all they that came out of Egypt by Moses? 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:17"><sup>17</sup></span> And with whom
was he displeased forty years? was it not with them that sinned,
whose bodies fell in the wilderness? 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:18"><sup>18</sup></span> And to whom sware he
that they should not enter into his rest, but to them that were
disobedient? 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:19"><sup>19</sup></span> And we see that they were not able to enter
in because of unbelief.

<p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:1"><sup>1</sup></span> Let us fear therefore, lest haply, a promise being left
of entering into his rest, any one of you should seem to have
come short of it. 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:2"><sup>2</sup></span> For indeed we have had good tidings
preached unto us, even as also they: but the word of hearing did
not profit them, because it was not united by faith with them
that heard. 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:3"><sup>3</sup></span> For we who have believed do enter into that
rest; even as he hath said,
As I sware in my wrath,
They shall not enter into my rest:
although the works were finished from the foundation of the
world. 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:4"><sup>4</sup></span> For he hath said somewhere of the seventh [day] on
this wise, And God rested on the seventh day from all his works;
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:5"><sup>5</sup></span> and in this [place] again,
They shall not enter into my rest.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:6"><sup>6</sup></span> Seeing therefore it remaineth that some should enter
thereinto, and they to whom the good tidings were before
preached failed to enter in because of disobedience, 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:7"><sup>7</sup></span> he
again defineth a certain day, To-day, saying in David so long a
time afterward (even as hath been said before),
To-day if ye shall hear his voice,
Harden not your hearts.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:8"><sup>8</sup></span> For if Joshua had given them rest, he would not have
spoken afterward of another day. 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:9"><sup>9</sup></span> There remaineth therefore
a sabbath rest for the people of God. 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:10"><sup>10</sup></span> For he that is
entered into his rest hath himself also rested from his works,
as God did from his. 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:11"><sup>11</sup></span> Let us therefore give diligence to
enter into that rest, that no man fall after the same example of
disobedience. 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:12"><sup>12</sup></span> For the word of God is living, and active,
and sharper than any two-edged sword, and piercing even to the
dividing of soul and spirit, of both joints and marrow, and
quick to discern the thoughts and intents of the heart. 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:13"><sup>13</sup></span> And there is no creature that is not manifest in his sight: but
all things are naked and laid open before the eyes of him with
whom we have to do. 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:14"><sup>14</sup></span> Having then a great high priest, who
hath passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us
hold fast our confession. 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:15"><sup>15</sup></span> For we have not a high priest
that cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities; but
one that hath been in all points tempted like as [we are, yet]
without sin. 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:16"><sup>16</sup></span> Let us therefore draw near with boldness
unto the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy, and may
find grace to help [us] in time of need.

<p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="7:1"><sup>1</sup></span> For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most
High, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings
and blessed him, 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="7:2"><sup>2</sup></span> to whom also Abraham divided a tenth part
of all (being first, by interpretation, King of righteousness,
and then also King of Salem, which is King of peace; 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="7:3"><sup>3</sup></span> without father, without mother, without genealogy, having
neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like unto
the Son of God), abideth a priest continually. 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="7:4"><sup>4</sup></span> Now
consider how great this man was, unto whom Abraham, the
patriarch, gave a tenth out of the chief spoils. 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="7:5"><sup>5</sup></span> And they
indeed of the sons of Levi that receive the priest's office have
commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law,
that is, of their brethren, though these have come out of the
loins of Abraham: 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="7:6"><sup>6</sup></span> but he whose genealogy is not counted
from them hath taken tithes of Abraham, and hath blessed him
that hath the promises. 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="7:7"><sup>7</sup></span> But without any dispute the less
is blessed of the better. 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="7:8"><sup>8</sup></span> And here men that die receive
tithes; but there one, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="7:9"><sup>9</sup></span> And, so to say, through Abraham even Levi, who receiveth
tithes, hath paid tithes; 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="7:10"><sup>10</sup></span> for he was yet in the loins of
his father, when Melchizedek met him. 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="7:11"><sup>11</sup></span> Now if there was
perfection through the Levitical priesthood (for under it hath
the people received the law), what further need [was there] that
another priest should arise after the order of Melchizedek, and
not be reckoned after the order of Aaron? 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="7:12"><sup>12</sup></span> For the
priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change
also of the law. 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="7:13"><sup>13</sup></span> For he of whom these things are said
belongeth to another tribe, from which no man hath given
attendance at the altar. 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="7:14"><sup>14</sup></span> For it is evident that our Lord
hath sprung out of Judah; as to which tribe Moses spake nothing
concerning priests. 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="7:15"><sup>15</sup></span> And [what we say] is yet more
abundantly evident, if after the likeness of Melchizedek there
ariseth another priest, 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="7:16"><sup>16</sup></span> who hath been made, not after the
law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless
life:

Thou art a priest for ever
After the order of Melchizedek.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="7:18"><sup>18</sup></span> For there is a disannulling of a foregoing commandment
because of its weakness and unprofitableness 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="7:19"><sup>19</sup></span> (for the law
made nothing perfect), and a bringing in thereupon of a better
hope, through which we draw nigh unto God. 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="7:20"><sup>20</sup></span> And inasmuch
as [it is] not without the taking of an oath 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="7:21"><sup>21</sup></span> (for they
indeed have been made priests without an oath; but he with an
oath by him that saith of him,
The Lord sware and will not repent himself,
Thou art a priest for ever);
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="7:22"><sup>22</sup></span> by so much also hath Jesus become the surety of a
better covenant. 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="7:23"><sup>23</sup></span> And they indeed have been made priests
many in number, because that by death they are hindered from
continuing:

priesthood unchangeable. 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="7:25"><sup>25</sup></span> Wherefore also he is able to
save to the uttermost them that draw near unto God through him,
seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them. 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="7:26"><sup>26</sup></span> For
such a high priest became us, holy, guileless, undefiled,
separated from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;

sacrifices, first for his own sins, and then for the [sins] of
the people: for this he did once for all, when he offered up
himself. 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="7:28"><sup>28</sup></span> For the law appointeth men high priests, having
infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was after the law,

<p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="8:1"><sup>1</sup></span> Now in the things which we are saying the chief point
[is this]: We have such a high priest, who sat down on the right
hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens, 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="8:2"><sup>2</sup></span> a
minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which the
Lord pitched, not man. 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="8:3"><sup>3</sup></span> For every high priest is appointed
to offer both gifts and sacrifices: wherefore it is necessary
that this [high priest] also have somewhat to offer. 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="8:4"><sup>4</sup></span> Now
if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, seeing
there are those who offer the gifts according to the law;

things, even as Moses is warned [of God] when he is about to
make the tabernacle: for, See, saith he, that thou make all
things according to the pattern that was showed thee in the
mount. 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="8:6"><sup>6</sup></span> But now hath he obtained a ministry the more

And they shall be to me a people:

<p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="9:1"><sup>1</sup></span> Now even a first [covenant] had ordinances of divine
service, and its sanctuary, [a sanctuary] of this world. 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="9:2"><sup>2</sup></span> For there was a tabernacle prepared, the first, wherein [were]
the candlestick, and the table, and the showbread; which is
called the Holy place. 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="9:3"><sup>3</sup></span> And after the second veil, the
tabernacle which is called the Holy of holies; 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="9:4"><sup>4</sup></span> having a
golden altar of incense, and the ark of the covenant overlaid
round about with gold, wherein [was] a golden pot holding the
manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the
covenant; 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="9:5"><sup>5</sup></span> and above it cherubim of glory overshadowing the
mercy-seat; of which things we cannot now speak severally. 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="9:6"><sup>6</sup></span> Now these things having been thus prepared, the priests go in
continually into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the
services; 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="9:7"><sup>7</sup></span> but into the second the high priest alone, once
in the year, not without blood, which he offereth for himself,
and for the errors of the people: 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="9:8"><sup>8</sup></span> the Holy Spirit this
signifying, that the way into the holy place hath not yet been
made manifest, while the first tabernacle is yet standing; 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="9:9"><sup>9</sup></span> which [is] a figure for the time present; according to which are
offered both gifts and sacrifices that cannot, as touching the
conscience, make the worshipper perfect, 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="9:10"><sup>10</sup></span> [being] only
(with meats and drinks and divers washings) carnal ordinances,
imposed until a time of reformation. 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="9:11"><sup>11</sup></span> But Christ having
come a high priest of the good things to come, through the
greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that
is to say, not of this creation, 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="9:12"><sup>12</sup></span> nor yet through the
blood of goats and calves, but through his own blood, entered in
once for all into the holy place, having obtained eternal
redemption. 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="9:13"><sup>13</sup></span> For if the blood of goats and bulls, and the
ashes of a heifer sprinkling them that have been defiled,
sanctify unto the cleanness of the flesh: 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="9:14"><sup>14</sup></span> how much more
shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit
offered himself without blemish unto God, cleanse your
conscience from dead works to serve the living God? 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="9:15"><sup>15</sup></span> And
for this cause he is the mediator of a new covenant, that a
death having taken place for the redemption of the
transgressions that were under the first covenant, they that
have been called may receive the promise of the eternal
inheritance. 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="9:16"><sup>16</sup></span> For where a testament is, there must of
necessity be the death of him that made it. 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="9:17"><sup>17</sup></span> For a
testament is of force where there hath been death: for it doth
never avail while he that made it liveth. 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="9:18"><sup>18</sup></span> Wherefore even
the first [covenant] hath not been dedicated without blood.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="9:19"><sup>19</sup></span> For when every commandment had been spoken by Moses unto
all the people according to the law, he took the blood of the
calves and the goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop,
and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people, 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="9:20"><sup>20</sup></span> saying, This is the blood of the covenant which God commanded to
you-ward. 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="9:21"><sup>21</sup></span> Moreover the tabernacle and all the vessels of
the ministry he sprinkled in like manner with the blood. 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="9:22"><sup>22</sup></span> And according to the law, I may almost say, all things are
cleansed with blood, and apart from shedding of blood there is
no remission. 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="9:23"><sup>23</sup></span> It was necessary therefore that the copies
of the things in the heavens should be cleansed with these; but
the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than
these. 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="9:24"><sup>24</sup></span> For Christ entered not into a holy place made with
hands, like in pattern to the true; but into heaven itself, now
to appear before the face of God for us: 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="9:25"><sup>25</sup></span> nor yet that he
should offer himself often, as the high priest entereth into the
holy place year by year with blood not his own; 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="9:26"><sup>26</sup></span> else must
he often have suffered since the foundation of the world: but
now once at the end of the ages hath he been manifested to put
away sin by the sacrifice of himself. 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="9:27"><sup>27</sup></span> And inasmuch as it
is appointed unto men once to die, and after this [cometh]
judgment; 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="9:28"><sup>28</sup></span> so Christ also, having been once offered to
bear the sins of many, shall appear a second time, apart from
sin, to them that wait for him, unto salvation.

<p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="11:1"><sup>1</sup></span> Now faith is assurance of [things] hoped for, a

Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain,
through which he had witness borne to him that he was righteous,
God bearing witness in respect of his gifts: and through it he
being dead yet speaketh.

that he should not see death; and he was not found, because God
translated him: for he hath had witness borne to him that before
his translation he had been well-pleasing unto God: 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="11:6"><sup>6</sup></span> And
without faith it is impossible to be well-pleasing [unto him];

is a rewarder of them that seek after him.

being warned [of God] concerning things not seen as yet, moved
with godly fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house;
through which he condemned the world, and became heir of the
righteousness which is according to faith.

Abraham, when he was called, obeyed to go out unto a place which
he was to receive for an inheritance; and he went out, not
knowing whither he went.

foundations, whose builder and maker is God.

even Sarah herself received power to conceive seed when she was
past age, since she counted him faithful who had promised:

them and greeted them from afar, and having confessed that they
were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.

say such things make it manifest that they are seeking after a
country of their own.

better [country], that is, a heavenly: wherefore God is not
ashamed of them, to be called their God; for he hath prepared
for them a city. 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="11:17"><sup>17</sup></span> By faith Abraham, being tried, offered
up Isaac: yea, he that had gladly received the promises was
offering up his only begotten [son];

was said, In Isaac shall thy seed be called:

the departure of the children of Israel; and gave commandment
concerning his bones. 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="11:23"><sup>23</sup></span> By faith Moses, when he was born,
was hid three months by his parents, because they saw he was a
goodly child; and they were not afraid of the king's
commandment. 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="11:24"><sup>24</sup></span> By faith Moses, when he was grown up,
refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter;

treasures of Egypt: for he looked unto the recompense of reward.

king: for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.

faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they had been
compassed about for seven days.

all have been made partakers, then are ye bastards, and not

chasten us, and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather
be in subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live?

not joyous but grievous; yet afterward it yieldeth peaceable
