</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:1"><sup>1</sup></span> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and
the Word was God. 
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:2"><sup>2</sup></span> The same was in the beginning with God.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:3"><sup>3</sup></span> All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing
made that was made.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:4"><sup>4</sup></span> In him was life; and the life was the light of men.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:5"><sup>5</sup></span> And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness
comprehended it not.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:6"><sup>6</sup></span> There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:7"><sup>7</sup></span> The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light,
that all men through him might believe.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:8"><sup>8</sup></span> He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that
Light.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:9"><sup>9</sup></span> That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh
into the world.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:10"><sup>10</sup></span> He was in the world, and the world was made by him, and the
world knew him not.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:11"><sup>11</sup></span> He came unto his own, and his own received him not.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:12"><sup>12</sup></span> But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become
the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name:
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:13"><sup>13</sup></span> Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh,
nor of the will of man, but of God.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:14"><sup>14</sup></span> And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us, (and we
beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the
Father,) full of grace and truth.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:15"><sup>15</sup></span> John bare witness of him, and cried, saying, This was he of
whom I spake, He that cometh after me is preferred before me:
for he was before me.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:16"><sup>16</sup></span> And of his fulness have all we received, and grace for grace.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:17"><sup>17</sup></span> For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by
Jesus Christ.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:18"><sup>18</sup></span> No man hath seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which
is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:19"><sup>19</sup></span> And this is the record of John, when the Jews sent priests and
Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, Who art thou?
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:20"><sup>20</sup></span> And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the
Christ.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:21"><sup>21</sup></span> And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elias? And he saith, I
am not. Art thou that prophet? And he answered, No.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:22"><sup>22</sup></span> Then said they unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an
answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:23"><sup>23</sup></span> He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make
straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:24"><sup>24</sup></span> And they which were sent were of the Pharisees.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:25"><sup>25</sup></span> And they asked him, and said unto him, Why baptizest thou
then, if thou be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that
prophet?
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:26"><sup>26</sup></span> John answered them, saying, I baptize with water: but there
standeth one among you, whom ye know not;
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:27"><sup>27</sup></span> He it is, who coming after me is preferred before me, whose
shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:28"><sup>28</sup></span> These things were done in Bethabara beyond Jordan, where John
was baptizing.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:29"><sup>29</sup></span> The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith,
Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the
world.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:30"><sup>30</sup></span> This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man which is
preferred before me: for he was before me.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:31"><sup>31</sup></span> And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to
Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:32"><sup>32</sup></span> And John bare record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from
heaven like a dove, and it abode upon him.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:33"><sup>33</sup></span> And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water,
the same said unto me, Upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit
descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which
baptizeth with the Holy Ghost.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:34"><sup>34</sup></span> And I saw, and bare record that this is the Son of God.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:35"><sup>35</sup></span> Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples;
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:36"><sup>36</sup></span> And looking upon Jesus as he walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb
of God!
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:37"><sup>37</sup></span> And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed
Jesus.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:38"><sup>38</sup></span> Then Jesus turned, and saw them following, and saith unto
them, What seek ye? They said unto him, Rabbi, (which is to
say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou?
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:39"><sup>39</sup></span> He saith unto them, Come and see. They came and saw where he
dwelt, and abode with him that day: for it was about the tenth
hour.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:40"><sup>40</sup></span> One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was
Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:41"><sup>41</sup></span> He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We
have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the
Christ.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:42"><sup>42</sup></span> And he brought him to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, he
said, Thou art Simon the son of Jona: thou shalt be called
Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:43"><sup>43</sup></span> The day following Jesus would go forth into Galilee, and
findeth Philip, and saith unto him, Follow me.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:44"><sup>44</sup></span> Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:45"><sup>45</sup></span> Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found
him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write,
Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:46"><sup>46</sup></span> And Nathanael said unto him, Can there any good thing come out
of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:47"><sup>47</sup></span> Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold an
Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:48"><sup>48</sup></span> Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus
answered and said unto him, Before that Philip called thee,
when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:49"><sup>49</sup></span> Nathanael answered and saith unto him, Rabbi, thou art the Son
of God; thou art the King of Israel.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:50"><sup>50</sup></span> Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I
saw thee under the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see
greater things than these.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="1:51"><sup>51</sup></span> And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you,
Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God
ascending and descending upon the Son of man.

</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:1"><sup>1</sup></span> And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and
the mother of Jesus was there:
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:2"><sup>2</sup></span> And both Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:3"><sup>3</sup></span> And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus saith unto him,
They have no wine.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:4"><sup>4</sup></span> Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine
hour is not yet come.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:5"><sup>5</sup></span> His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto
you, do it.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:6"><sup>6</sup></span> And there were set there six waterpots of stone, after the
manner of the purifying of the Jews, containing two or three
firkins apiece.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:7"><sup>7</sup></span> Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they
filled them up to the brim.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:8"><sup>8</sup></span> And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the
governor of the feast. And they bare it.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:9"><sup>9</sup></span> When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made
wine, and knew not whence it was: (but the servants which drew
the water knew;) the governor of the feast called the
bridegroom,
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:10"><sup>10</sup></span> And saith unto him, Every man at the beginning doth set forth
good wine; and when men have well drunk, then that which is
worse: but thou hast kept the good wine until now.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:11"><sup>11</sup></span> This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and
manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.

his brethren, and his disciples: and they continued there not
many days.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:13"><sup>13</sup></span> And the Jews' passover was at hand, and Jesus went up to
Jerusalem.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:14"><sup>14</sup></span> And found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and
doves, and the changers of money sitting:
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="2:15"><sup>15</sup></span> And when he had made a scourge of small cords, he drove them
all out of the temple, and the sheep, and the oxen; and poured
out the changers' money, and overthrew the tables;

make not my Father's house an house of merchandise.

thine house hath eaten me up.

thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?

three days I will raise it up.

building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days?

<p><span id="3"></span>
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:1"><sup>1</sup></span> There was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of
the Jews:
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:2"><sup>2</sup></span> The same came to Jesus by night, and said unto him, Rabbi, we
know that thou art a teacher come from God: for no man can do
these miracles that thou doest, except God be with him.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:3"><sup>3</sup></span> Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto
thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of
God.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:4"><sup>4</sup></span> Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is
old? can he enter the second time into his mother's womb, and
be born?
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:5"><sup>5</sup></span> Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man
be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the
kingdom of God.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:6"><sup>6</sup></span> That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is
born of the Spirit is spirit.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:7"><sup>7</sup></span> Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born again.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:8"><sup>8</sup></span> The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound
thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whither it
goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:9"><sup>9</sup></span> Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:10"><sup>10</sup></span> Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou a master of Israel,
and knowest not these things?
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:11"><sup>11</sup></span> Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that we do know, and
testify that we have seen; and ye receive not our witness.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:12"><sup>12</sup></span> If I have told you earthly things, and ye believe not, how
shall ye believe, if I tell you of heavenly things?
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:13"><sup>13</sup></span> And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down
from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:14"><sup>14</sup></span> And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so
must the Son of man be lifted up:
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:15"><sup>15</sup></span> That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have
eternal life.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:16"><sup>16</sup></span> For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten
Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but
have everlasting life.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:17"><sup>17</sup></span> For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world;
but that the world through him might be saved.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:18"><sup>18</sup></span> He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that
believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not
believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:19"><sup>19</sup></span> And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the
world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their
deeds were evil.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:20"><sup>20</sup></span> For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh
to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:21"><sup>21</sup></span> But he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds
may be made manifest, that they are wrought in God.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:22"><sup>22</sup></span> After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land
of Judaea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:23"><sup>23</sup></span> And John also was baptizing in Aenon near to Salim, because
there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:24"><sup>24</sup></span> For John was not yet cast into prison.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:25"><sup>25</sup></span> Then there arose a question between some of John's disciples
and the Jews about purifying.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:26"><sup>26</sup></span> And they came unto John, and said unto him, Rabbi, he that was
with thee beyond Jordan, to whom thou barest witness, behold,
the same baptizeth, and all men come to him.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:27"><sup>27</sup></span> John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it
be given him from heaven.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:28"><sup>28</sup></span> Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the
Christ, but that I am sent before him.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:29"><sup>29</sup></span> He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of
the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth
greatly because of the bridegroom's voice: this my joy
therefore is fulfilled.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:30"><sup>30</sup></span> He must increase, but I must decrease.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:31"><sup>31</sup></span> He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the
earth is earthly, and speaketh of the earth: he that cometh
from heaven is above all.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:32"><sup>32</sup></span> And what he hath seen and heard, that he testifieth; and no
man receiveth his testimony.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:33"><sup>33</sup></span> He that hath received his testimony hath set to his seal that
God is true.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:34"><sup>34</sup></span> For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for God
giveth not the Spirit by measure unto him.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:35"><sup>35</sup></span> The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his
hand.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="3:36"><sup>36</sup></span> He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life: and he
that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath
of God abideth on him.

</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:1"><sup>1</sup></span> When therefore the Lord knew how the Pharisees had heard that
Jesus made and baptized more disciples than John,
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:2"><sup>2</sup></span> (Though Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples,)
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:3"><sup>3</sup></span> He left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:4"><sup>4</sup></span> And he must needs go through Samaria.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:5"><sup>5</sup></span> Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar,
near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son
Joseph.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:6"><sup>6</sup></span> Now Jacob's well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied
with his journey, sat thus on the well: and it was about the
sixth hour.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:7"><sup>7</sup></span> There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith
unto her, Give me to drink.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:8"><sup>8</sup></span> (For his disciples were gone away unto the city to buy meat.)
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:9"><sup>9</sup></span> Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is it that thou,
being a Jew, askest drink of me, which am a woman of Samaria?
for the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:10"><sup>10</sup></span> Jesus answered and said unto her, If thou knewest the gift of
God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou
wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee
living water.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:11"><sup>11</sup></span> The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with,
and the well is deep: from whence then hast thou that living
water?
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:12"><sup>12</sup></span> Art thou greater than our father Jacob, which gave us the
well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his
cattle?
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:13"><sup>13</sup></span> Jesus answered and said unto her, Whosoever drinketh of this
water shall thirst again:
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:14"><sup>14</sup></span> But whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him
shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall
be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:15"><sup>15</sup></span> The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I
thirst not, neither come hither to draw.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:16"><sup>16</sup></span> Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:17"><sup>17</sup></span> The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Jesus said
unto her, Thou hast well said, I have no husband:
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:18"><sup>18</sup></span> For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is
not thy husband: in that saidst thou truly.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:19"><sup>19</sup></span> The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a
prophet.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:20"><sup>20</sup></span> Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in
Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:21"><sup>21</sup></span> Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when
ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem,
worship the Father.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:22"><sup>22</sup></span> Ye worship ye know not what: we know what we worship: for
salvation is of the Jews.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:23"><sup>23</sup></span> But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers
shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth: for the
Father seeketh such to worship him.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:24"><sup>24</sup></span> God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in
spirit and in truth.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:25"><sup>25</sup></span> The woman saith unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is
called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all things.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:26"><sup>26</sup></span> Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am he.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:27"><sup>27</sup></span> And upon this came his disciples, and marvelled that he talked
with the woman: yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why
talkest thou with her?
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:28"><sup>28</sup></span> The woman then left her waterpot, and went her way into the
city, and saith to the men,
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:29"><sup>29</sup></span> Come, see a man, which told me all things that ever I did: is
not this the Christ?
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:30"><sup>30</sup></span> Then they went out of the city, and came unto him.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:31"><sup>31</sup></span> In the mean while his disciples prayed him, saying, Master,
eat.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:32"><sup>32</sup></span> But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:33"><sup>33</sup></span> Therefore said the disciples one to another, Hath any man
brought him ought to eat?
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:34"><sup>34</sup></span> Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that
sent me, and to finish his work.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:35"><sup>35</sup></span> Say not ye, There are yet four months, and then cometh
harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look
on the fields; for they are white already to harvest.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:36"><sup>36</sup></span> And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto
life eternal: that both he that soweth and he that reapeth may
rejoice together.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:37"><sup>37</sup></span> And herein is that saying true, One soweth, and another
reapeth.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:38"><sup>38</sup></span> I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed no labour: other
men laboured, and ye are entered into their labours.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:39"><sup>39</sup></span> And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on him for
the saying of the woman, which testified, He told me all that
ever I did.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:40"><sup>40</sup></span> So when the Samaritans were come unto him, they besought him
that he would tarry with them: and he abode there two days.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:41"><sup>41</sup></span> And many more believed because of his own word;
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:42"><sup>42</sup></span> And said unto the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy
saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is
indeed the Christ, the Saviour of the world.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:43"><sup>43</sup></span> Now after two days he departed thence, and went into Galilee.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:44"><sup>44</sup></span> For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honour in
his own country.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:45"><sup>45</sup></span> Then when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received
him, having seen all the things that he did at Jerusalem at
the feast: for they also went unto the feast.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:46"><sup>46</sup></span> So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the
water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was
sick at Capernaum.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:47"><sup>47</sup></span> When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee,
he went unto him, and besought him that he would come down,
and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:48"><sup>48</sup></span> Then said Jesus unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye
will not believe.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:49"><sup>49</sup></span> The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:50"><sup>50</sup></span> Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. And the man
believed the word that Jesus had spoken unto him, and he went
his way.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:51"><sup>51</sup></span> And as he was now going down, his servants met him, and told
him, saying, Thy son liveth.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:52"><sup>52</sup></span> Then enquired he of them the hour when he began to amend. And
they said unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever
left him.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:53"><sup>53</sup></span> So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which
Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and
his whole house.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="4:54"><sup>54</sup></span> This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when he was
come out of Judaea into Galilee.

<p><span id="5"></span>
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="5:1"><sup>1</sup></span> After this there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to
Jerusalem.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="5:2"><sup>2</sup></span> Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is
called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="5:3"><sup>3</sup></span> In these lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind,
halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="5:4"><sup>4</sup></span> For an angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and
troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling
of the water stepped in was made whole of whatsoever disease
he had.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="5:5"><sup>5</sup></span> And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and
eight years.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="5:6"><sup>6</sup></span> When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been now a long
time in that case, he saith unto him, Wilt thou be made whole?
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="5:7"><sup>7</sup></span> The impotent man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the
water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am
coming, another steppeth down before me.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="5:8"><sup>8</sup></span> Jesus saith unto him, Rise, take up thy bed, and walk.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="5:9"><sup>9</sup></span> And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed,
and walked: and on the same day was the sabbath.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="5:10"><sup>10</sup></span> The Jews therefore said unto him that was cured, It is the
sabbath day: it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="5:11"><sup>11</sup></span> He answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto
me, Take up thy bed, and walk.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="5:12"><sup>12</sup></span> Then asked they him, What man is that which said unto thee,
Take up thy bed, and walk?
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="5:13"><sup>13</sup></span> And he that was healed wist not who it was: for Jesus had
conveyed himself away, a multitude being in that place.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="5:14"><sup>14</sup></span> Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him,
Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing
come unto thee.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="5:15"><sup>15</sup></span> The man departed, and told the Jews that it was Jesus, which
had made him whole.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="5:16"><sup>16</sup></span> And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay
him, because he had done these things on the sabbath day.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="5:17"><sup>17</sup></span> But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh hitherto, and I
work.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="5:18"><sup>18</sup></span> Therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not
only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was his
Father, making himself equal with God.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="5:19"><sup>19</sup></span> Then answered Jesus and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say
unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth
the Father do: for what things soever he doeth, these also
doeth the Son likewise.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="5:20"><sup>20</sup></span> For the Father loveth the Son, and sheweth him all things that
himself doeth: and he will shew him greater works than these,
that ye may marvel.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="5:21"><sup>21</sup></span> For as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them;
even so the Son quickeneth whom he will.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="5:22"><sup>22</sup></span> For the Father judgeth no man, but hath committed all judgment
unto the Son:
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="5:23"><sup>23</sup></span> That all men should honour the Son, even as they honour the
Father. He that honoureth not the Son honoureth not the Father
which hath sent him.

believeth on him that sent me, hath everlasting life, and
shall not come into condemnation; but is passed from death
unto life.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="5:25"><sup>25</sup></span> Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now
is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God: and
they that hear shall live.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="5:26"><sup>26</sup></span> For as the Father hath life in himself; so hath he given to
the Son to have life in himself;

he is the Son of man.

that are in the graves shall hear his voice,

resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the
resurrection of damnation.

judgment is just; because I seek not mine own will, but the
will of the Father which hath sent me.

the witness which he witnesseth of me is true.

which the Father hath given me to finish, the same works that
I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="5:37"><sup>37</sup></span> And the Father himself, which hath sent me, hath borne witness
of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen
his shape.

</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="6:1"><sup>1</sup></span> After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which
is the sea of Tiberias.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="6:2"><sup>2</sup></span> And a great multitude followed him, because they saw his
miracles which he did on them that were diseased.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="6:3"><sup>3</sup></span> And Jesus went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his
disciples.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="6:4"><sup>4</sup></span> And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="6:5"><sup>5</sup></span> When Jesus then lifted up his eyes, and saw a great company
come unto him, he saith unto Philip, Whence shall we buy
bread, that these may eat?
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="6:6"><sup>6</sup></span> And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he
would do.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="6:7"><sup>7</sup></span> Philip answered him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not
sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="6:8"><sup>8</sup></span> One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, saith
unto him,
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="6:9"><sup>9</sup></span> There is a lad here, which hath five barley loaves, and two
small fishes: but what are they among so many?
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="6:10"><sup>10</sup></span> And Jesus said, Make the men sit down. Now there was much
grass in the place. So the men sat down, in number about five
thousand.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="6:11"><sup>11</sup></span> And Jesus took the loaves; and when he had given thanks, he
distributed to the disciples, and the disciples to them that
were set down; and likewise of the fishes as much as they
would.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="6:12"><sup>12</sup></span> When they were filled, he said unto his disciples, Gather up
the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="6:13"><sup>13</sup></span> Therefore they gathered them together, and filled twelve
baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves, which
remained over and above unto them that had eaten.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="6:14"><sup>14</sup></span> Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did,
said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into
the world.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="6:15"><sup>15</sup></span> When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take
him by force, to make him a king, he departed again into a
mountain himself alone.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="6:16"><sup>16</sup></span> And when even was now come, his disciples went down unto the
sea,
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="6:17"><sup>17</sup></span> And entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward
Capernaum. And it was now dark, and Jesus was not come to
them.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="6:18"><sup>18</sup></span> And the sea arose by reason of a great wind that blew.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="6:19"><sup>19</sup></span> So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty
furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing nigh
unto the ship: and they were afraid.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="6:20"><sup>20</sup></span> But he saith unto them, It is I; be not afraid.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="6:21"><sup>21</sup></span> Then they willingly received him into the ship: and
immediately the ship was at the land whither they went.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="6:22"><sup>22</sup></span> The day following, when the people which stood on the other
side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there, save
that one whereinto his disciples were entered, and that Jesus
went not with his disciples into the boat, but that his
disciples were gone away alone;
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="6:23"><sup>23</sup></span> (Howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias nigh unto the
place where they did eat bread, after that the Lord had given
thanks:)
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="6:24"><sup>24</sup></span> When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there,
neither his disciples, they also took shipping, and came to
Capernaum, seeking for Jesus.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="6:25"><sup>25</sup></span> And when they had found him on the other side of the sea, they
said unto him, Rabbi, when camest thou hither?
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="6:26"><sup>26</sup></span> Jesus answered them and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you,
Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye
did eat of the loaves, and were filled.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="6:27"><sup>27</sup></span> Labour not for the meat which perisheth, but for that meat
which endureth unto everlasting life, which the Son of man
shall give unto you: for him hath God the Father sealed.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="6:28"><sup>28</sup></span> Then said they unto him, What shall we do, that we might work
the works of God?
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="6:29"><sup>29</sup></span> Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God,
that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="6:30"><sup>30</sup></span> They said therefore unto him, What sign shewest thou then,
that we may see, and believe thee? what dost thou work?
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="6:31"><sup>31</sup></span> Our fathers did eat manna in the desert; as it is written, He
gave them bread from heaven to eat.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="6:32"><sup>32</sup></span> Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you,
Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but my Father
giveth you the true bread from heaven.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="6:33"><sup>33</sup></span> For the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven, and
giveth life unto the world.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="6:34"><sup>34</sup></span> Then said they unto him, Lord, evermore give us this bread.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="6:35"><sup>35</sup></span> And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that
cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me
shall never thirst.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="6:36"><sup>36</sup></span> But I said unto you, That ye also have seen me, and believe
not.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="6:37"><sup>37</sup></span> All that the Father giveth me shall come to me; and him that
cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="6:38"><sup>38</sup></span> For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the
will of him that sent me.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="6:39"><sup>39</sup></span> And this is the Father's will which hath sent me, that of all
which he hath given me I should lose nothing, but should raise
it up again at the last day.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="6:40"><sup>40</sup></span> And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which
seeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlasting
life: and I will raise him up at the last day.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="6:41"><sup>41</sup></span> The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, I am the bread
which came down from heaven.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="6:42"><sup>42</sup></span> And they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose
father and mother we know? how is it then that he saith, I
came down from heaven?
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="6:43"><sup>43</sup></span> Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, Murmur not among
yourselves.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="6:44"><sup>44</sup></span> No man can come to me, except the Father which hath sent me
draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="6:45"><sup>45</sup></span> It is written in the prophets, And they shall be all taught of
God. Every man therefore that hath heard, and hath learned of
the Father, cometh unto me.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="6:46"><sup>46</sup></span> Not that any man hath seen the Father, save he which is of
God, he hath seen the Father.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="6:47"><sup>47</sup></span> Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that believeth on me hath
everlasting life.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="6:48"><sup>48</sup></span> I am that bread of life.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="6:49"><sup>49</sup></span> Your fathers did eat manna in the wilderness, and are dead.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="6:50"><sup>50</sup></span> This is the bread which cometh down from heaven, that a man
may eat thereof, and not die.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="6:51"><sup>51</sup></span> I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man
eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that
I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the
world.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="6:52"><sup>52</sup></span> The Jews therefore strove among themselves, saying, How can
this man give us his flesh to eat?
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="6:53"><sup>53</sup></span> Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you,
Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his
blood, ye have no life in you.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="6:54"><sup>54</sup></span> Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal
life; and I will raise him up at the last day.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="6:55"><sup>55</sup></span> For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="6:56"><sup>56</sup></span> He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in
me, and I in him.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="6:57"><sup>57</sup></span> As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father:
so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="6:58"><sup>58</sup></span> This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your
fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this
bread shall live for ever.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="6:59"><sup>59</sup></span> These things said he in the synagogue, as he taught in
Capernaum.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="6:60"><sup>60</sup></span> Many therefore of his disciples, when they had heard this,
said, This is an hard saying; who can hear it?
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="6:61"><sup>61</sup></span> When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it,
he said unto them, Doth this offend you?
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="6:62"><sup>62</sup></span> What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was
before?
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="6:63"><sup>63</sup></span> It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing:
the words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are
life.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="6:64"><sup>64</sup></span> But there are some of you that believe not. For Jesus knew
from the beginning who they were that believed not, and who
should betray him.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="6:65"><sup>65</sup></span> And he said, Therefore said I unto you, that no man can come
unto me, except it were given unto him of my Father.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="6:66"><sup>66</sup></span> From that time many of his disciples went back, and walked no
more with him.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="6:67"><sup>67</sup></span> Then said Jesus unto the twelve, Will ye also go away?
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="6:68"><sup>68</sup></span> Then Simon Peter answered him, Lord, to whom shall we go? thou
hast the words of eternal life.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="6:69"><sup>69</sup></span> And we believe and are sure that thou art that Christ, the Son
of the living God.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="6:70"><sup>70</sup></span> Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of
you is a devil?
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="6:71"><sup>71</sup></span> He spake of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon: for he it was
that should betray him, being one of the twelve.

</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="7:1"><sup>1</sup></span> After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not
walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill him.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="7:2"><sup>2</sup></span> Now the Jew's feast of tabernacles was at hand.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="7:3"><sup>3</sup></span> His brethren therefore said unto him, Depart hence, and go
into Judaea, that thy disciples also may see the works that
thou doest.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="7:4"><sup>4</sup></span> For there is no man that doeth any thing in secret, and he
himself seeketh to be known openly. If thou do these things,
shew thyself to the world.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="7:5"><sup>5</sup></span> For neither did his brethren believe in him.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="7:6"><sup>6</sup></span> Then Jesus said unto them, My time is not yet come: but your
time is alway ready.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="7:7"><sup>7</sup></span> The world cannot hate you; but me it hateth, because I testify

my time is not yet full come.

Galilee.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="7:10"><sup>10</sup></span> But when his brethren were gone up, then went he also up unto
the feast, not openly, but as it were in secret.

</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="7:12"><sup>12</sup></span> And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him:
for some said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; but he
deceiveth the people.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="7:13"><sup>13</sup></span> Howbeit no man spake openly of him for fear of the Jews.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="7:14"><sup>14</sup></span> Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the
temple, and taught.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="7:15"><sup>15</sup></span> And the Jews marvelled, saying, How knoweth this man letters,
having never learned?
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="7:16"><sup>16</sup></span> Jesus answered them, and said, My doctrine is not mine, but
his that sent me.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="7:17"><sup>17</sup></span> If any man will do his will, he shall know of the doctrine,
whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="7:18"><sup>18</sup></span> He that speaketh of himself seeketh his own glory: but he that
seeketh his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no
unrighteousness is in him.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="7:19"><sup>19</sup></span> Did not Moses give you the law, and yet none of you keepeth
the law? Why go ye about to kill me?

about to kill thee?
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="7:21"><sup>21</sup></span> Jesus answered and said unto them, I have done one work, and
ye all marvel.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="7:22"><sup>22</sup></span> Moses therefore gave unto you circumcision; (not because it is
of Moses, but of the fathers;) and ye on the sabbath day
circumcise a man.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="7:23"><sup>23</sup></span> If a man on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law
of Moses should not be broken; are ye angry at me, because I
have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day?

judgment.

seek to kill?
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="7:26"><sup>26</sup></span> But, lo, he speaketh boldly, and they say nothing unto him. Do
the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ?

because his hour was not yet come.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="7:31"><sup>31</sup></span> And many of the people believed on him, and said, When Christ
cometh, will he do more miracles than these which this man
hath done?
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="7:32"><sup>32</sup></span> The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things
concerning him; and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent

</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="7:33"><sup>33</sup></span> Then said Jesus unto them, Yet a little while am I with you,
and then I go unto him that sent me.

thither ye cannot come.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="7:35"><sup>35</sup></span> Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will he go, that
we shall not find him? will he go unto the dispersed among the
Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="7:36"><sup>36</sup></span> What manner of saying is this that he said, Ye shall seek me,
and shall not find me: and where I am, thither ye cannot come?
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="7:37"><sup>37</sup></span> In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and
cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and
drink.

him should receive: for the Holy Ghost was not yet given;
because that Jesus was not yet glorified.)
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="7:40"><sup>40</sup></span> Many of the people therefore, when they heard this saying,
said, Of a truth this is the Prophet.

come out of Galilee?

David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was?

on him.

they said unto them, Why have ye not brought him?

</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="8:1"><sup>1</sup></span> Jesus went unto the mount of Olives.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="8:2"><sup>2</sup></span> And early in the morning he came again into the temple, and
all the people came unto him; and he sat down, and taught
them.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="8:3"><sup>3</sup></span> And the scribes and Pharisees brought unto him a woman taken
in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst,
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="8:4"><sup>4</sup></span> They say unto him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery,
in the very act.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="8:5"><sup>5</sup></span> Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned:
but what sayest thou?
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="8:6"><sup>6</sup></span> This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse
him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the
ground, as though he heard them not.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="8:7"><sup>7</sup></span> So when they continued asking him, he lifted up himself, and
said unto them, He that is without sin among you, let him
first cast a stone at her.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="8:8"><sup>8</sup></span> And again he stooped down, and wrote on the ground.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="8:9"><sup>9</sup></span> And they which heard it, being convicted by their own
conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest, even
unto the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman
standing in the midst.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="8:10"><sup>10</sup></span> When Jesus had lifted up himself, and saw none but the woman,
he said unto her, Woman, where are those thine accusers? hath
no man condemned thee?
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="8:11"><sup>11</sup></span> She said, No man, Lord. And Jesus said unto her, Neither do I
condemn thee: go, and sin no more.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="8:12"><sup>12</sup></span> Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of
the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness,
but shall have the light of life.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="8:13"><sup>13</sup></span> The Pharisees therefore said unto him, Thou bearest record of
thyself; thy record is not true.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="8:14"><sup>14</sup></span> Jesus answered and said unto them, Though I bear record of
myself, yet my record is true: for I know whence I came, and
whither I go; but ye cannot tell whence I come, and whither I
go.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="8:15"><sup>15</sup></span> Ye judge after the flesh; I judge no man.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="8:16"><sup>16</sup></span> And yet if I judge, my judgment is true: for I am not alone,
but I and the Father that sent me.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="8:17"><sup>17</sup></span> It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men
is true.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="8:18"><sup>18</sup></span> I am one that bear witness of myself, and the Father that sent
me beareth witness of me.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="8:19"><sup>19</sup></span> Then said they unto him, Where is thy Father? Jesus answered,
Ye neither know me, nor my Father: if ye had known me, ye
should have known my Father also.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="8:20"><sup>20</sup></span> These words spake Jesus in the treasury, as he taught in the
temple: and no man laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet
come.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="8:21"><sup>21</sup></span> Then said Jesus again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall
seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot
come.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="8:22"><sup>22</sup></span> Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself? because he saith,
Whither I go, ye cannot come.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="8:23"><sup>23</sup></span> And he said unto them, Ye are from beneath; I am from above:
ye are of this world; I am not of this world.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="8:24"><sup>24</sup></span> I said therefore unto you, that ye shall die in your sins: for
if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="8:25"><sup>25</sup></span> Then said they unto him, Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto
them, Even the same that I said unto you from the beginning.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="8:26"><sup>26</sup></span> I have many things to say and to judge of you: but he that
sent me is true; and I speak to the world those things which I
have heard of him.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="8:27"><sup>27</sup></span> They understood not that he spake to them of the Father.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="8:28"><sup>28</sup></span> Then said Jesus unto them, When ye have lifted up the Son of
man, then shall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of
myself; but as my Father hath taught me, I speak these things.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="8:29"><sup>29</sup></span> And he that sent me is with me: the Father hath not left me
alone; for I do always those things that please him.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="8:30"><sup>30</sup></span> As he spake these words, many believed on him.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="8:31"><sup>31</sup></span> Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him, If ye
continue in my word, then are ye my disciples indeed;
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="8:32"><sup>32</sup></span> And ye shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you
free.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="8:33"><sup>33</sup></span> They answered him, We be Abraham's seed, and were never in
bondage to any man: how sayest thou, Ye shall be made free?
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="8:34"><sup>34</sup></span> Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whosoever
committeth sin is the servant of sin.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="8:35"><sup>35</sup></span> And the servant abideth not in the house for ever: but the Son
abideth ever.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="8:36"><sup>36</sup></span> If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free
indeed.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="8:37"><sup>37</sup></span> I know that ye are Abraham's seed; but ye seek to kill me,
because my word hath no place in you.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="8:38"><sup>38</sup></span> I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that
which ye have seen with your father.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="8:39"><sup>39</sup></span> They answered and said unto him, Abraham is our father. Jesus
saith unto them, If ye were Abraham's children, ye would do
the works of Abraham.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="8:40"><sup>40</sup></span> But now ye seek to kill me, a man that hath told you the
truth, which I have heard of God: this did not Abraham.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="8:41"><sup>41</sup></span> Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be
not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="8:42"><sup>42</sup></span> Jesus said unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love
me: for I proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of
myself, but he sent me.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="8:43"><sup>43</sup></span> Why do ye not understand my speech? even because ye cannot
hear my word.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="8:44"><sup>44</sup></span> Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father
ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode
not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he
speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and
the father of it.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="8:45"><sup>45</sup></span> And because I tell you the truth, ye believe me not.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="8:46"><sup>46</sup></span> Which of you convinceth me of sin? And if I say the truth, why
do ye not believe me?
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="8:47"><sup>47</sup></span> He that is of God heareth God's words: ye therefore hear them
not, because ye are not of God.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="8:48"><sup>48</sup></span> Then answered the Jews, and said unto him, Say we not well
that thou art a Samaritan, and hast a devil?
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="8:49"><sup>49</sup></span> Jesus answered, I have not a devil; but I honour my Father,
and ye do dishonour me.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="8:50"><sup>50</sup></span> And I seek not mine own glory: there is one that seeketh and
judgeth.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="8:51"><sup>51</sup></span> Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he
shall never see death.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="8:52"><sup>52</sup></span> Then said the Jews unto him, Now we know that thou hast a
devil. Abraham is dead, and the prophets; and thou sayest, If
a man keep my saying, he shall never taste of death.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="8:53"><sup>53</sup></span> Art thou greater than our father Abraham, which is dead? and
the prophets are dead: whom makest thou thyself?
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="8:54"><sup>54</sup></span> Jesus answered, If I honour myself, my honour is nothing: it
is my Father that honoureth me; of whom ye say, that he is
your God:
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="8:55"><sup>55</sup></span> Yet ye have not known him; but I know him: and if I should
say, I know him not, I shall be a liar like unto you: but I
know him, and keep his saying.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="8:56"><sup>56</sup></span> Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day: and he saw it, and
was glad.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="8:57"><sup>57</sup></span> Then said the Jews unto him, Thou art not yet fifty years old,
and hast thou seen Abraham?
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="8:58"><sup>58</sup></span> Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before
Abraham was, I am.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="8:59"><sup>59</sup></span> Then took they up stones to cast at him: but Jesus hid
himself, and went out of the temple, going through the midst
of them, and so passed by.

</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="9:1"><sup>1</sup></span> And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his
birth.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="9:2"><sup>2</sup></span> And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this
man, or his parents, that he was born blind?
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="9:3"><sup>3</sup></span> Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents:
but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="9:4"><sup>4</sup></span> I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day:
the night cometh, when no man can work.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="9:5"><sup>5</sup></span> As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="9:6"><sup>6</sup></span> When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay
of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with
the clay,

by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and
washed, and came seeing.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="9:8"><sup>8</sup></span> The neighbours therefore, and they which before had seen him
that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sat and begged?

said, I am he.

</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="9:11"><sup>11</sup></span> He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay,
and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of
Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="9:12"><sup>12</sup></span> Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know not.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="9:13"><sup>13</sup></span> They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="9:14"><sup>14</sup></span> And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and
opened his eyes.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="9:15"><sup>15</sup></span> Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received
his sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and
I washed, and do see.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="9:16"><sup>16</sup></span> Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God,
because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others said, How can a
man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a
division among them.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="9:17"><sup>17</sup></span> They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him,
that he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="9:18"><sup>18</sup></span> But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been
blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents
of him that had received his sight.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="9:19"><sup>19</sup></span> And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was
born blind? how then doth he now see?
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="9:20"><sup>20</sup></span> His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our
son, and that he was born blind:
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="9:21"><sup>21</sup></span> But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath
opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall
speak for himself.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="9:22"><sup>22</sup></span> These words spake his parents, because they feared the Jews:
for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess
that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.

him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="9:25"><sup>25</sup></span> He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I know
not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.

he thine eyes?

hear: wherefore would ye hear it again? will ye also be his
disciples?
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="9:28"><sup>28</sup></span> Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we
are Moses' disciples.

not from whence he is.

marvellous thing, that ye know not from whence he is, and yet
he hath opened mine eyes.

sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out.

him, he said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?

</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="10:6"><sup>6</sup></span> This parable spake Jesus unto them: but they understood not
what things they were which he spake unto them.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="10:7"><sup>7</sup></span> Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto
you, I am the door of the sheep.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="10:8"><sup>8</sup></span> All that ever came before me are thieves and robbers: but the
sheep did not hear them.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="10:9"><sup>9</sup></span> I am the door: by me if any man enter in, he shall be saved,
and shall go in and out, and find pasture.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="10:10"><sup>10</sup></span> The thief cometh not, but for to steal, and to kill, and to
destroy: I am come that they might have life, and that they
might have it more abundantly.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="10:11"><sup>11</sup></span> I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for
the sheep.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="10:12"><sup>12</sup></span> But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own
the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the
sheep, and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth
the sheep.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="10:13"><sup>13</sup></span> The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not
for the sheep.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="10:14"><sup>14</sup></span> I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of
mine.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="10:15"><sup>15</sup></span> As the Father knoweth me, even so know I the Father: and I lay
down my life for the sheep.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="10:16"><sup>16</sup></span> And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also
I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be
one fold, and one shepherd.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="10:17"><sup>17</sup></span> Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life,
that I might take it again.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="10:18"><sup>18</sup></span> No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself. I have
power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This
commandment have I received of my Father.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="10:19"><sup>19</sup></span> There was a division therefore again among the Jews for these
sayings.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="10:20"><sup>20</sup></span> And many of them said, He hath a devil, and is mad; why hear
ye him?
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="10:21"><sup>21</sup></span> Others said, These are not the words of him that hath a devil.
Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="10:22"><sup>22</sup></span> And it was at Jerusalem the feast of the dedication, and it
was winter.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="10:23"><sup>23</sup></span> And Jesus walked in the temple in Solomon's porch.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="10:24"><sup>24</sup></span> Then came the Jews round about him, and said unto him, How
long dost thou make us to doubt? If thou be the Christ, tell
us plainly.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="10:25"><sup>25</sup></span> Jesus answered them, I told you, and ye believed not: the
works that I do in my Father's name, they bear witness of me.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="10:26"><sup>26</sup></span> But ye believe not, because ye are not of my sheep, as I said
unto you.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="10:27"><sup>27</sup></span> My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me:
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="10:28"><sup>28</sup></span> And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never
perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="10:29"><sup>29</sup></span> My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all; and no man
is able to pluck them out of my Father's hand.

</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="10:31"><sup>31</sup></span> Then the Jews took up stones again to stone him.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="10:32"><sup>32</sup></span> Jesus answered them, Many good works have I shewed you from my
Father; for which of those works do ye stone me?
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="10:33"><sup>33</sup></span> The Jews answered him, saying, For a good work we stone thee
not; but for blasphemy; and because that thou, being a man,
makest thyself God.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="10:34"><sup>34</sup></span> Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye
are gods?
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="10:35"><sup>35</sup></span> If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came, and
the scripture cannot be broken;
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="10:36"><sup>36</sup></span> Say ye of him, whom the Father hath sanctified, and sent into
the world, Thou blasphemest; because I said, I am the Son of
God?
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="10:37"><sup>37</sup></span> If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="10:38"><sup>38</sup></span> But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works: that
ye may know, and believe, that the Father is in me, and I in
him.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="10:39"><sup>39</sup></span> Therefore they sought again to take him: but he escaped out of
their hand,
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="10:40"><sup>40</sup></span> And went away again beyond Jordan into the place where John at
first baptized; and there he abode.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="10:41"><sup>41</sup></span> And many resorted unto him, and said, John did no miracle: but
all things that John spake of this man were true.

</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="11:1"><sup>1</sup></span> Now a certain man was sick, named Lazarus, of Bethany, the
town of Mary and her sister Martha.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="11:2"><sup>2</sup></span> (It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment, and
wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.)
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="11:3"><sup>3</sup></span> Therefore his sisters sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he
whom thou lovest is sick.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="11:4"><sup>4</sup></span> When Jesus heard that, he said, This sickness is not unto
death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God might be
glorified thereby.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="11:5"><sup>5</sup></span> Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="11:6"><sup>6</sup></span> When he had heard therefore that he was sick, he abode two
days still in the same place where he was.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="11:7"><sup>7</sup></span> Then after that saith he to his disciples, Let us go into
Judaea again.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="11:8"><sup>8</sup></span> His disciples say unto him, Master, the Jews of late sought to
stone thee; and goest thou thither again?
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="11:9"><sup>9</sup></span> Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any
man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the
light of this world.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="11:10"><sup>10</sup></span> But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is
no light in him.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="11:11"><sup>11</sup></span> These things said he: and after that he saith unto them, Our
friend Lazarus sleepeth; but I go, that I may awake him out of
sleep.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="11:12"><sup>12</sup></span> Then said his disciples, Lord, if he sleep, he shall do well.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="11:13"><sup>13</sup></span> Howbeit Jesus spake of his death: but they thought that he had
spoken of taking of rest in sleep.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="11:14"><sup>14</sup></span> Then said Jesus unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="11:15"><sup>15</sup></span> And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the
intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="11:16"><sup>16</sup></span> Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, unto his
fellowdisciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="11:17"><sup>17</sup></span> Then when Jesus came, he found that he had lain in the grave
four days already.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="11:18"><sup>18</sup></span> Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs
off:
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="11:19"><sup>19</sup></span> And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them
concerning their brother.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="11:20"><sup>20</sup></span> Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming, went
and met him: but Mary sat still in the house.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="11:21"><sup>21</sup></span> Then said Martha unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my
brother had not died.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="11:22"><sup>22</sup></span> But I know, that even now, whatsoever thou wilt ask of God,
God will give it thee.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="11:23"><sup>23</sup></span> Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="11:24"><sup>24</sup></span> Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the
resurrection at the last day.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="11:25"><sup>25</sup></span> Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he
that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live:
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="11:26"><sup>26</sup></span> And whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.
Believest thou this?
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="11:27"><sup>27</sup></span> She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I believe that thou art the
Christ, the Son of God, which should come into the world.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="11:28"><sup>28</sup></span> And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary
her sister secretly, saying, The Master is come, and calleth
for thee.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="11:29"><sup>29</sup></span> As soon as she heard that, she arose quickly, and came unto
him.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="11:30"><sup>30</sup></span> Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that
place where Martha met him.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="11:31"><sup>31</sup></span> The Jews then which were with her in the house, and comforted
her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up hastily and went
out, followed her, saying, She goeth unto the grave to weep
there.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="11:32"><sup>32</sup></span> Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw him, she fell
down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been
here, my brother had not died.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="11:33"><sup>33</sup></span> When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also
weeping which came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was
troubled.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="11:34"><sup>34</sup></span> And said, Where have ye laid him? They said unto him, Lord,
come and see.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="11:35"><sup>35</sup></span> Jesus wept.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="11:36"><sup>36</sup></span> Then said the Jews, Behold how he loved him!
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="11:37"><sup>37</sup></span> And some of them said, Could not this man, which opened the
eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not
have died?
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="11:38"><sup>38</sup></span> Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the grave.
It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="11:39"><sup>39</sup></span> Jesus said, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him
that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time he stinketh:
for he hath been dead four days.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="11:40"><sup>40</sup></span> Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou
wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="11:41"><sup>41</sup></span> Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead
was laid. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I
thank thee that thou hast heard me.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="11:42"><sup>42</sup></span> And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the
people which stand by I said it, that they may believe that
thou hast sent me.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="11:43"><sup>43</sup></span> And when he thus had spoken, he cried with a loud voice,
Lazarus, come forth.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="11:44"><sup>44</sup></span> And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with
graveclothes: and his face was bound about with a napkin.
Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="11:45"><sup>45</sup></span> Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the
things which Jesus did, believed on him.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="11:46"><sup>46</sup></span> But some of them went their ways to the Pharisees, and told
them what things Jesus had done.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="11:47"><sup>47</sup></span> Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees a council,
and said, What do we? for this man doeth many miracles.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="11:48"><sup>48</sup></span> If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the
Romans shall come and take away both our place and nation.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="11:49"><sup>49</sup></span> And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that
same year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all,
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="11:50"><sup>50</sup></span> Nor consider that it is expedient for us, that one man should
die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="11:51"><sup>51</sup></span> And this spake he not of himself: but being high priest that
year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation;
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="11:52"><sup>52</sup></span> And not for that nation only, but that also he should gather
together in one the children of God that were scattered
abroad.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="11:53"><sup>53</sup></span> Then from that day forth they took counsel together for to put
him to death.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="11:54"><sup>54</sup></span> Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews; but went
thence unto a country near to the wilderness, into a city
called Ephraim, and there continued with his disciples.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="11:55"><sup>55</sup></span> And the Jews' passover was nigh at hand: and many went out of
the country up to Jerusalem before the passover, to purify
themselves.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="11:56"><sup>56</sup></span> Then sought they for Jesus, and spake among themselves, as
they stood in the temple, What think ye, that he will not come
to the feast?
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="11:57"><sup>57</sup></span> Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a
commandment, that, if any man knew where he were, he should
shew it, that they might take him.

</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="12:1"><sup>1</sup></span> Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where
Lazarus was, which had been dead, whom he raised from the
dead.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="12:2"><sup>2</sup></span> There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus
was one of them that sat at the table with him.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="12:3"><sup>3</sup></span> Then took Mary a pound of ointment of spikenard, very costly,
and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her
hair: and the house was filled with the odour of the ointment.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="12:4"><sup>4</sup></span> Then saith one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son,
which should betray him,
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="12:5"><sup>5</sup></span> Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and
given to the poor?
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="12:6"><sup>6</sup></span> This he said, not that he cared for the poor; but because he
was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="12:7"><sup>7</sup></span> Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the day of my burying
hath she kept this.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="12:8"><sup>8</sup></span> For the poor always ye have with you; but me ye have not
always.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="12:9"><sup>9</sup></span> Much people of the Jews therefore knew that he was there: and
they came not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might see
Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="12:10"><sup>10</sup></span> But the chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus
also to death;
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="12:11"><sup>11</sup></span> Because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and
believed on Jesus.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="12:12"><sup>12</sup></span> On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when
they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="12:13"><sup>13</sup></span> Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and
cried, Hosanna: Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in
the name of the Lord.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="12:14"><sup>14</sup></span> And Jesus, when he had found a young ass, sat thereon; as it
is written,

on an ass's colt.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="12:16"><sup>16</sup></span> These things understood not his disciples at the first: but
when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these
things were written of him, and that they had done these
things unto him.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="12:17"><sup>17</sup></span> The people therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus
out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="12:18"><sup>18</sup></span> For this cause the people also met him, for that they heard
that he had done this miracle.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="12:19"><sup>19</sup></span> The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive ye how
ye prevail nothing? behold, the world is gone after him.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="12:20"><sup>20</sup></span> And there were certain Greeks among them that came up to
worship at the feast:
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="12:21"><sup>21</sup></span> The same came therefore to Philip, which was of Bethsaida of
Galilee, and desired him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.

tell Jesus.

saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.

it thundered: others said, An angel spake to him.

but for your sakes.

they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their

but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest
they should be put out of the synagogue:

</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="13:1"><sup>1</sup></span> Now before the feast of the passover, when Jesus knew that his
hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the
Father, having loved his own which were in the world, he loved
them unto the end.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="13:2"><sup>2</sup></span> And supper being ended, the devil having now put into the
heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him;
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="13:3"><sup>3</sup></span> Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his
hands, and that he was come from God, and went to God;
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="13:4"><sup>4</sup></span> He riseth from supper, and laid aside his garments; and took a
towel, and girded himself.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="13:5"><sup>5</sup></span> After that he poureth water into a bason, and began to wash
the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel wherewith
he was girded.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="13:6"><sup>6</sup></span> Then cometh he to Simon Peter: and Peter saith unto him, Lord,
dost thou wash my feet?
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="13:7"><sup>7</sup></span> Jesus answered and said unto him, What I do thou knowest not
now; but thou shalt know hereafter.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="13:8"><sup>8</sup></span> Peter saith unto him, Thou shalt never wash my feet. Jesus
answered him, If I wash thee not, thou hast no part with me.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="13:9"><sup>9</sup></span> Simon Peter saith unto him, Lord, not my feet only, but also
my hands and my head.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="13:10"><sup>10</sup></span> Jesus saith to him, He that is washed needeth not save to wash
his feet, but is clean every whit: and ye are clean, but not
all.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="13:11"><sup>11</sup></span> For he knew who should betray him; therefore said he, Ye are
not all clean.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="13:12"><sup>12</sup></span> So after he had washed their feet, and had taken his garments,
and was set down again, he said unto them, Know ye what I have
done to you?
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="13:13"><sup>13</sup></span> Ye call me Master and Lord: and ye say well; for so I am.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="13:14"><sup>14</sup></span> If I then, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet; ye
also ought to wash one another's feet.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="13:15"><sup>15</sup></span> For I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have
done to you.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="13:16"><sup>16</sup></span> Verily, verily, I say unto you, The servant is not greater
than his lord; neither he that is sent greater than he that
sent him.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="13:17"><sup>17</sup></span> If ye know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="13:18"><sup>18</sup></span> I speak not of you all: I know whom I have chosen: but that
the scripture may be fulfilled, He that eateth bread with me
hath lifted up his heel against me.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="13:19"><sup>19</sup></span> Now I tell you before it come, that, when it is come to pass,
ye may believe that I am he.

send receiveth me; and he that receiveth me receiveth him that
sent me.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="13:21"><sup>21</sup></span> When Jesus had thus said, he was troubled in spirit, and
testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, that one
of you shall betray me.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="13:22"><sup>22</sup></span> Then the disciples looked one on another, doubting of whom he
spake.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="13:23"><sup>23</sup></span> Now there was leaning on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples,
whom Jesus loved.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="13:24"><sup>24</sup></span> Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who
it should be of whom he spake.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="13:25"><sup>25</sup></span> He then lying on Jesus' breast saith unto him, Lord, who is
it?
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="13:26"><sup>26</sup></span> Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop, when I
have dipped it. And when he had dipped the sop, he gave it to
Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="13:27"><sup>27</sup></span> And after the sop Satan entered into him. Then said Jesus unto
him, That thou doest, do quickly.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="13:28"><sup>28</sup></span> Now no man at the table knew for what intent he spake this
unto him.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="13:29"><sup>29</sup></span> For some of them thought, because Judas had the bag, that
Jesus had said unto him, Buy those things that we have need of
against the feast; or, that he should give something to the
poor.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="13:30"><sup>30</sup></span> He then having received the sop went immediately out: and it
was night.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="13:31"><sup>31</sup></span> Therefore, when he was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the Son of
man glorified, and God is glorified in him.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="13:32"><sup>32</sup></span> If God be glorified in him, God shall also glorify him in
himself, and shall straightway glorify him.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="13:33"><sup>33</sup></span> Little children, yet a little while I am with you. Ye shall
seek me: and as I said unto the Jews, Whither I go, ye cannot
come; so now I say to you.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="13:34"><sup>34</sup></span> A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another;
as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="13:35"><sup>35</sup></span> By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye
have love one to another.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="13:36"><sup>36</sup></span> Simon Peter said unto him, Lord, whither goest thou? Jesus
answered him, Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but
thou shalt follow me afterwards.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="13:37"><sup>37</sup></span> Peter said unto him, Lord, why cannot I follow thee now? I
will lay down my life for thy sake.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="13:38"><sup>38</sup></span> Jesus answered him, Wilt thou lay down thy life for my sake?
Verily, verily, I say unto thee, The cock shall not crow, till
thou hast denied me thrice.

</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="18:1"><sup>1</sup></span> When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his
disciples over the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into the
which he entered, and his disciples.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="18:2"><sup>2</sup></span> And Judas also, which betrayed him, knew the place: for Jesus
ofttimes resorted thither with his disciples.

the chief priests and Pharisees, cometh thither with lanterns
and torches and weapons.

went forth, and said unto them, Whom seek ye?
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="18:5"><sup>5</sup></span> They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I
am he. And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them.

backward, and fell to the ground.

of Nazareth.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="18:8"><sup>8</sup></span> Jesus answered, I have told you that I am he: if therefore ye
seek me, let these go their way:
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="18:9"><sup>9</sup></span> That the saying might be fulfilled, which he spake, Of them
which thou gavest me have I lost none.

priest's servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant's
name was Malchus.

the cup which my Father hath given me, shall I not drink it?

Jesus, and bound him,

Caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year.

was expedient that one man should die for the people.

that disciple was known unto the high priest, and went in with
Jesus into the palace of the high priest.

disciple, which was known unto the high priest, and spake unto
her that kept the door, and brought in Peter.

thou also one of this man's disciples? He saith, I am not.

of coals; for it was cold: and they warmed themselves: and
Peter stood with them, and warmed himself.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="18:19"><sup>19</sup></span> The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his
doctrine.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="18:20"><sup>20</sup></span> Jesus answered him, I spake openly to the world; I ever taught
in the synagogue, and in the temple, whither the Jews always
resort; and in secret have I said nothing.

unto them: behold, they know what I said.

by struck Jesus with the palm of his hand, saying, Answerest
thou the high priest so?

evil: but if well, why smitest thou me?

unto him, Art not thou also one of his disciples? He denied
it, and said, I am not.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="18:26"><sup>26</sup></span> One of the servants of the high priest, being his kinsman
whose ear Peter cut off, saith, Did not I see thee in the
garden with him?

</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="18:28"><sup>28</sup></span> Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas unto the hall of judgment:
and it was early; and they themselves went not into the
judgment hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they
might eat the passover.

bring ye against this man?
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="18:30"><sup>30</sup></span> They answered and said unto him, If he were not a malefactor,
we would not have delivered him up unto thee.

according to your law. The Jews therefore said unto him, It is
not lawful for us to put any man to death:

signifying what death he should die.

Jesus, and said unto him, Art thou the King of the Jews?
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="18:34"><sup>34</sup></span> Jesus answered him, Sayest thou this thing of thyself, or did
others tell it thee of me?
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="18:35"><sup>35</sup></span> Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief
priests have delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done?
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="18:36"><sup>36</sup></span> Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom
were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I
should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not
from hence.

answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end was I
born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should
bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth
heareth my voice.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="18:38"><sup>38</sup></span> Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said
this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I
find in him no fault at all.

the passover: will ye therefore that I release unto you the

Now Barabbas was a robber.

afraid;

Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.

thou not that I have power to crucify thee, and have power to

delivered me unto thee hath the greater sin.

they took Jesus, and led him away.

</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="19:24"><sup>24</sup></span> They said therefore among themselves, Let us not rend it, but
cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might
be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my raiment among them,
and for my vesture they did cast lots. These things therefore
the soldiers did.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="19:25"><sup>25</sup></span> Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his
mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary
Magdalene.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="19:26"><sup>26</sup></span> When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing
by, whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy
son!
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="19:27"><sup>27</sup></span> Then saith he to the disciple, Behold thy mother! And from
that hour that disciple took her unto his own home.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="19:28"><sup>28</sup></span> After this, Jesus knowing that all things were now
accomplished, that the scripture might be fulfilled, saith, I
thirst.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="19:29"><sup>29</sup></span> Now there was set a vessel full of vinegar: and they filled a
spunge with vinegar, and put it upon hyssop, and put it to his
mouth.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="19:30"><sup>30</sup></span> When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is
finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up the ghost.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="19:31"><sup>31</sup></span> The Jews therefore, because it was the preparation, that the
bodies should not remain upon the cross on the sabbath day,
(for that sabbath day was an high day,) besought Pilate that
their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="19:32"><sup>32</sup></span> Then came the soldiers, and brake the legs of the first, and
of the other which was crucified with him.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="19:33"><sup>33</sup></span> But when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already,
they brake not his legs:
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="19:34"><sup>34</sup></span> But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and
forthwith came there out blood and water.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="19:35"><sup>35</sup></span> And he that saw it bare record, and his record is true: and he
knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="19:36"><sup>36</sup></span> For these things were done, that the scripture should be
fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="19:37"><sup>37</sup></span> And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom
they pierced.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="19:38"><sup>38</sup></span> And after this Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of
Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, besought Pilate that
he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave him
leave. He came therefore, and took the body of Jesus.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="19:39"><sup>39</sup></span> And there came also Nicodemus, which at the first came to
Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes,
about an hundred pound weight.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="19:40"><sup>40</sup></span> Then took they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen
clothes with the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="19:41"><sup>41</sup></span> Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden;
and in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet
laid.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="19:42"><sup>42</sup></span> There laid they Jesus therefore because of the Jews'
preparation day; for the sepulchre was nigh at hand.

</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="20:1"><sup>1</sup></span> The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it
was yet dark, unto the sepulchre, and seeth the stone taken
away from the sepulchre.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="20:2"><sup>2</sup></span> Then she runneth, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other
disciple, whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have
taken away the Lord out of the sepulchre, and we know not
where they have laid him.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="20:3"><sup>3</sup></span> Peter therefore went forth, and that other disciple, and came
to the sepulchre.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="20:4"><sup>4</sup></span> So they ran both together: and the other disciple did outrun
Peter, and came first to the sepulchre.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="20:5"><sup>5</sup></span> And he stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes
lying; yet went he not in.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="20:6"><sup>6</sup></span> Then cometh Simon Peter following him, and went into the
sepulchre, and seeth the linen clothes lie,
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="20:7"><sup>7</sup></span> And the napkin, that was about his head, not lying with the
linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="20:8"><sup>8</sup></span> Then went in also that other disciple, which came first to the
sepulchre, and he saw, and believed.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="20:9"><sup>9</sup></span> For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise
again from the dead.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="20:10"><sup>10</sup></span> Then the disciples went away again unto their own home.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="20:11"><sup>11</sup></span> But Mary stood without at the sepulchre weeping: and as she
wept, she stooped down, and looked into the sepulchre,
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="20:12"><sup>12</sup></span> And seeth two angels in white sitting, the one at the head,
and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="20:13"><sup>13</sup></span> And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith unto
them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not
where they have laid him.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="20:14"><sup>14</sup></span> And when she had thus said, she turned herself back, and saw
Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="20:15"><sup>15</sup></span> Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest
thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him,
Sir, if thou have borne him hence, tell me where thou hast
laid him, and I will take him away.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="20:16"><sup>16</sup></span> Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turned herself, and saith unto
him, Rabboni; which is to say, Master.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="20:17"><sup>17</sup></span> Jesus saith unto her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended
to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I
ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and
your God.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="20:18"><sup>18</sup></span> Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen
the Lord, and that he had spoken these things unto her.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="20:19"><sup>19</sup></span> Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week,
when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled
for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the midst, and
saith unto them, Peace be unto you.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="20:20"><sup>20</sup></span> And when he had so said, he shewed unto them his hands and his
side. Then were the disciples glad, when they saw the Lord.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="20:21"><sup>21</sup></span> Then said Jesus to them again, Peace be unto you: as my Father
hath sent me, even so send I you.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="20:22"><sup>22</sup></span> And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto
them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost:
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="20:23"><sup>23</sup></span> Whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and
whose soever sins ye retain, they are retained.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="20:24"><sup>24</sup></span> But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with
them when Jesus came.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="20:25"><sup>25</sup></span> The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the
Lord. But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands
the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of
the nails, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not
believe.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="20:26"><sup>26</sup></span> And after eight days again his disciples were within, and
Thomas with them: then came Jesus, the doors being shut, and
stood in the midst, and said, Peace be unto you.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="20:27"><sup>27</sup></span> Then saith He to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and behold
my hands; and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my
side: and be not faithless, but believing.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="20:28"><sup>28</sup></span> And Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="20:29"><sup>29</sup></span> Jesus saith unto him, Thomas, because thou hast seen Me, thou
hast believed: blessed are they that have not seen, and yet
have believed.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="20:30"><sup>30</sup></span> And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of His
disciples, which are not written in this book:
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="20:31"><sup>31</sup></span> But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the
Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life
through His name.

<p><span id="21"></span>
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="21:1"><sup>1</sup></span> After these things Jesus shewed himself again to the disciples
at the sea of Tiberias; and on this wise shewed he himself.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="21:2"><sup>2</sup></span> There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus,
and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the sons of Zebedee, and
two other of his disciples.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="21:3"><sup>3</sup></span> Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto
him, We also go with thee. They went forth, and entered into a
ship immediately; and that night they caught nothing.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="21:4"><sup>4</sup></span> But when the morning was now come, Jesus stood on the shore:
but the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="21:5"><sup>5</sup></span> Then Jesus saith unto them, Children, have ye any meat? They
answered him, No.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="21:6"><sup>6</sup></span> And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the
ship, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they
were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="21:7"><sup>7</sup></span> Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It
is the Lord. Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord,
he girt his fisher's coat unto him, (for he was naked,) and
did cast himself into the sea.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="21:8"><sup>8</sup></span> And the other disciples came in a little ship; (for they were
not far from land, but as it were two hundred cubits,)
dragging the net with fishes.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="21:9"><sup>9</sup></span> As soon then as they were come to land, they saw a fire of
coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="21:10"><sup>10</sup></span> Jesus saith unto them, Bring of the fish which ye have now
caught.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="21:11"><sup>11</sup></span> Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to land full of great
fishes, an hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were
so many, yet was not the net broken.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="21:12"><sup>12</sup></span> Jesus saith unto them, Come and dine. And none of the
disciples durst ask him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the
Lord.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="21:13"><sup>13</sup></span> Jesus then cometh, and taketh bread, and giveth them, and fish
likewise.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="21:14"><sup>14</sup></span> This is now the third time that Jesus shewed himself to his
disciples, after that he was risen from the dead.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="21:15"><sup>15</sup></span> So when they had dined, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, son
of Jonas, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him,
Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him,
Feed my lambs.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="21:16"><sup>16</sup></span> He saith to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas,
lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest
that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my sheep.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="21:17"><sup>17</sup></span> He saith unto him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, lovest
thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third
time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest
all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto
him, Feed my sheep.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="21:18"><sup>18</sup></span> Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou
girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when
thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and
another shall gird thee, and carry <i>thee</i> whither thou wouldest
not.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="21:19"><sup>19</sup></span> This spake he, signifying by what death he should glorify God.
And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="21:20"><sup>20</sup></span> Then Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved
following; which also leaned on his breast at supper, and
said, Lord, which is he that betrayeth thee?
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="21:21"><sup>21</sup></span> Peter seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man
do?
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="21:22"><sup>22</sup></span> Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come,
what is that to thee? follow thou me.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="21:23"><sup>23</sup></span> Then went this saying abroad among the brethren, that that
disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, He shall
not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is
that to thee?
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="21:24"><sup>24</sup></span> This is the disciple which testifieth of these things, and
wrote these things: and we know that his testimony is true.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="21:25"><sup>25</sup></span> And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the
which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that
even the world itself could not contain the books that should
be written. Amen.
