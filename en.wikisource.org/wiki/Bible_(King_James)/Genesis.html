</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="37:1"><sup>1</sup></span> And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger, in the land of Canaan.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="37:2"><sup>2</sup></span> These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and the lad was with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah, his father's wives: and Joseph brought unto his father their evil report.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="37:3"><sup>3</sup></span> Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many colours.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="37:4"><sup>4</sup></span> And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably unto him.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="37:5"><sup>5</sup></span> And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren: and they hated him yet the more.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="37:6"><sup>6</sup></span> And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I have dreamed:
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="37:7"><sup>7</sup></span> For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="37:8"><sup>8</sup></span> And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us? or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him yet the more for his dreams, and for his words.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="37:9"><sup>9</sup></span> And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren, and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="37:10"><sup>10</sup></span> And he told it to his father, and to his brethren: and his father rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="37:11"><sup>11</sup></span> And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the saying.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="37:12"><sup>12</sup></span> And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="37:13"><sup>13</sup></span> And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the flock in Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he said to him, Here am I.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="37:14"><sup>14</sup></span> And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well with thy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word again. So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="37:15"><sup>15</sup></span> And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="37:16"><sup>16</sup></span> And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where they feed their flocks.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="37:17"><sup>17</sup></span> And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren, and found them in Dothan.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="37:18"><sup>18</sup></span> And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto them, they conspired against him to slay him.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="37:19"><sup>19</sup></span> And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="37:20"><sup>20</sup></span> Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into some pit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him: and we shall see what will become of his dreams.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="37:21"><sup>21</sup></span> And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands; and said, Let us not kill him.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="37:22"><sup>22</sup></span> And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, but cast him into this pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him; that he might rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to his father again.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="37:23"><sup>23</sup></span> And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren, that they stript Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many colours that was on him;
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="37:24"><sup>24</sup></span> And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit was empty, there was no water in it.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="37:25"><sup>25</sup></span> And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from Gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh, going to carry it down to Egypt.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="37:26"><sup>26</sup></span> And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay our brother, and conceal his blood?
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="37:27"><sup>27</sup></span> Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmeelites, and let not our hand be upon him; for he is our brother and our flesh. And his brethren were content.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="37:28"><sup>28</sup></span> Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the Ishmeelites for twenty pieces of silver: and they brought Joseph into Egypt.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="37:29"><sup>29</sup></span> And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not in the pit; and he rent his clothes.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="37:30"><sup>30</sup></span> And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not; and I, whither shall I go?
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="37:31"><sup>31</sup></span> And they took Joseph's coat, and killed a kid of the goats, and dipped the coat in the blood;
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="37:32"><sup>32</sup></span> And they sent the coat of many colours, and they brought it to their father; and said, This have we found: know now whether it be thy son's coat or no.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="37:33"><sup>33</sup></span> And he knew it, and said, It is my son's coat; an evil beast hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="37:34"><sup>34</sup></span> And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="37:35"><sup>35</sup></span> And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go down into the grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept for him.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="37:36"><sup>36</sup></span> And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh's, and captain of the guard.

</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="38:1"><sup>1</sup></span> And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="38:2"><sup>2</sup></span> And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose name was Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="38:3"><sup>3</sup></span> And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="38:4"><sup>4</sup></span> And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his name Onan.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="38:5"><sup>5</sup></span> And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him.

</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="38:7"><sup>7</sup></span> And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Lord</span>; and the <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Lord</span> slew him.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="38:8"><sup>8</sup></span> And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother's wife, and marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="38:9"><sup>9</sup></span> And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to pass, when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled it on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his brother.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="38:10"><sup>10</sup></span> And the thing which he did displeased the <span style="font-variant:small-caps">Lord</span>: wherefore he slew him also.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="38:11"><sup>11</sup></span> Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow at thy father's house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he said, Lest peradventure he die also, as his brethren did. And Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="38:12"><sup>12</sup></span> And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah's wife died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his sheepshearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="38:13"><sup>13</sup></span> And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth up to Timnath to shear his sheep.

</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="38:15"><sup>15</sup></span> When Judah saw her, he thought her to be an harlot; because she had covered her face.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="38:16"><sup>16</sup></span> And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she was his daughter in law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me, that thou mayest come in unto me?
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="38:17"><sup>17</sup></span> And he said, I will send thee a kid from the flock. And she said, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it?

</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="38:19"><sup>19</sup></span> And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her, and put on the garments of her widowhood.

</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="38:24"><sup>24</sup></span> And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the harlot; and also, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="38:25"><sup>25</sup></span> When she was brought forth, she sent to her father in law, saying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she said, Discern, I pray thee, whose are these, the signet, and bracelets, and staff.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="38:26"><sup>26</sup></span> And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She hath been more righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my son. And he knew her again no more.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="38:27"><sup>27</sup></span> And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold, twins were in her womb.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="38:28"><sup>28</sup></span> And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out his hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a scarlet thread, saying, This came out first.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="38:29"><sup>29</sup></span> And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold, his brother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken forth? this breach be upon thee: therefore his name was called Pharez.

</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="41:1"><sup>1</sup></span> And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="41:2"><sup>2</sup></span> And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well favoured kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow.

</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="41:5"><sup>5</sup></span> And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="41:6"><sup>6</sup></span> And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="41:7"><sup>7</sup></span> And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="41:8"><sup>8</sup></span> And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his dream; but there was none that could interpret them unto Pharaoh.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="41:9"><sup>9</sup></span> Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do remember my faults this day:
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="41:10"><sup>10</sup></span> Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the captain of the guard's house, both me and the chief baker:
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="41:11"><sup>11</sup></span> And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each man according to the interpretation of his dream.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="41:12"><sup>12</sup></span> And there was there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="41:13"><sup>13</sup></span> And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="41:14"><sup>14</sup></span> Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="41:15"><sup>15</sup></span> And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of thee, that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="41:16"><sup>16</sup></span> And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="41:17"><sup>17</sup></span> And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood upon the bank of the river:
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="41:18"><sup>18</sup></span> And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine, fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow:
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="41:19"><sup>19</sup></span> And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all the land of Egypt for badness:
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="41:20"><sup>20</sup></span> And the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first seven fat kine:
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="41:21"><sup>21</sup></span> And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that they had eaten them; but they were still ill favoured, as at the beginning. So I awoke.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="41:22"><sup>22</sup></span> And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one stalk, full and good:

</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="41:25"><sup>25</sup></span> And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God hath shewed Pharaoh what he is about to do.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="41:26"><sup>26</sup></span> The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears are seven years: the dream is one.

</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="41:28"><sup>28</sup></span> This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God is about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh.

</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="41:31"><sup>31</sup></span> And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following; for it shall be very grievous.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="41:32"><sup>32</sup></span> And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="41:33"><sup>33</sup></span> Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="41:34"><sup>34</sup></span> Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years.
</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="41:35"><sup>35</sup></span> And let them gather all the food of those good years that come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them keep food in the cities.

</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="41:39"><sup>39</sup></span> And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed thee all this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou art:

</p><p><span style="color:#2E8B57;" id="42:2"><sup>2</sup></span> And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt: get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may live, and not die.
