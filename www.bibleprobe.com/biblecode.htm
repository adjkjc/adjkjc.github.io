		Biblical text and perhaps also now via the Bible Codes.</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="3" face="verdana, arial, sans-serif">The idea of a hidden 
		code in the Bible text is not new. It is a central concept in the 
		Cabala, or traditional Jewish mysticism. According to Cabalistic 
		teachers, the simple meaning of the Bible text is not its true meaning. 
		They believe that God used the individual letters of the Hebrew Bible 
		text as symbols, which when properly understood reveal a greater truth. 
		In their view, each Hebrew letter and its position in the Bible text was 
		set by God with a specific purpose in mind.</font> </p>
		<p><font face="Arial">Bible Codes and written surface words are just two 
		facets of the Bible. According to ancient Jewish tradition, the Bible 
		has 70 facets. Many say that everything is in the Torah--encrypted in 
		some way. Your birth date, your death date, when you will marry, etc.</font></p>
                    <p><font size="3" face="Arial"><b>BACKGROUND:</b></font></p>
<font size="3" face="Arial">It is believed that the Bible code, found in the 
		Bible's original Hebrew form, was initially discovered by the rabbi 
		H.M.D. Weissmandel in Prague, Czechoslovakia, some 50 years ago. By 
		skipping the first 50 words and then another 50 words, the word 'Torah' 
		- the Pentateuch, the first five books of the Old Testament usually 
		ascribed to Moses - was spelt out at the beginning of the Book of 
		Genesis. The same skip sequence spelled out 'Torah' in the Book of 
		Exodus, the Book of Numbers and in the Book of Deuteronomy.</font>
                    <p><font size="3" face="Arial">A passage written about the 
					Torah by an 18th Century rabbi and &quot;sage&quot;, </font><FONT face="Arial,Helvetica" size="3">
					Elijah Ben Solomon Zalman </FONT><font size="3" face="Arial">
					(1720-1797), called the Genius of Vilna says: &quot;The rule is 
					that all that was, is, and will be unto the end of time is 
					included in the Torah, from the first word to the last word. 
					And not merely in a general sense, but as to the details of 
					every species and each one individually, and details of 
					details of everything that happened to him from the day of 
					his birth until his end.&quot; </font></p>
<FONT face="Verdana" color="black">The words of the Genius of Vilna seem to echo 
		the words of a much earlier Jewish &quot;genius&quot; - the greatest Rabbi of all 
		time,Yeshua/Jesus the Messiah. He said; <I>&quot;I tell you the truth, until 
		heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least 
		stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law (the Torah) 
		until everything is accomplished.&quot; Matthew 5:18 NIV </I></FONT>
                    <p><FONT face="Verdana" color="black">&nbsp;</FONT></p>
<font size="3" face="Arial">In tractate Sanhedrin we read: &quot;Daniel decoded the 
		message, placing the second word under the first, and the third under 
		the second, and then reading down....&quot;</font><P><FONT face="Arial" color="black" size="3">
		This view of the Scriptures is different than our modern idea of the 
		Bible. So long as the contextual meaning of the verses remain in tact we 
		are not too concerned with &quot;the smallest letter.&quot; However, the statement 
		of Jesus above shows an awareness that each individual letter is 
		essential to the whole message. That is exactly true of the Bible Code. 
		Since it involves exact mathematical precision every letter must be in 
		its place or the code will not work! Surely, the above statement shows 
		that the Son of God had a supernatural awareness of the amazing depth of 
		meaning in every letter of God's Word! </FONT><P><FONT face="Arial" color="black" size="3">
		Hints in the Bible like this led one of the greatest scientists who ever 
		lived, Sir Isaac Newton, to search for a Bible Code. He believed the 
		Bible Code to be more important than any of his great discoveries, 
		including the mechanics of our universe and the force of gravity! Most 
		of the million words in Newton's papers, found at Cambridge University, 
		are concerned with Newton's search for the Bible Code that would unlock 
		the future. &quot;Newton was still searching for the Bible Code when he died. 
		But his lifetime quest failed no matter what mathematical model he 
		applied ...</FONT><FONT color=green face="Verdana"> </FONT></P>        <p><font size="4" face="Arial"><b><u>

                    <p><font size="3" face="Arial">Certainly we have enough in 
					both the New Testament and Old Testaments for absolute 
					salvation and eternal life. &nbsp;But what about the &quot;hunt&quot;?

					would enjoy hunting for more of His word? &nbsp;Wouldn't the 
					following verse seem to suggest this?</font></p>

		Or, was He talking about the generation born in 1948 and after (Baby 
		Boomers)?&nbsp; It is also interesting that the &quot;Computer Age&quot; which was 
		necessary to search these codes began subsequent to this.&nbsp; So, just 
		perhaps there is something here in the codes for us.&nbsp; Perhaps not.&nbsp;&nbsp;

		There is an old Jewish tradition about a &quot;hidden text&quot; in the Hebrew 
		Pentateuch (the Five Books of Moses), consisting of words or phrases 
		expressed in the form of equidistant letter sequences (ELS's) -- that is 
		by selecting sequences of equally spaced letters in the text. Since this 
		tradition was passed orally, only few expressions that belong to the 
		&quot;hidden text&quot; were preserved in writing (Rabbenu Bahya, 1492 and 
		Cordovero, 1592); actually almost all the words and the syntax are 
		unknown. Rabbi H.M.D. Weissmandel (Weissmandel, 1958) was the first to 
		try to show the existence of such a &quot;hidden text&quot;, by finding 
		interesting patterns consisting of ELS's.</font><font face="verdana, arial, sans-serif"><br>
