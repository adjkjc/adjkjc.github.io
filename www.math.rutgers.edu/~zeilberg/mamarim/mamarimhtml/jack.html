Irving John ("Jack") Good (9 December 1916 - 5 April 2009) was one of my greatest heroes and influencers.
On Oct. 25, 2009, I gave a twenty-three minute talk with the present title, and
this article is an extended transcript of that talk. As with <b>all</b> my papers, the
"accompanying" Maple package is much more important (mathematically, of course, I also talk about
the human side of Jack in this article, and this is even more important than any math).
In particular, I taught Jack's brilliant ideas to my computer, and now it can do
even better than Jack.

To have the computer guess, and (rigorously prove at the same time!)  the recurrence for the
Dyson product for n from 2 to 8, the
<br>
<A HREF="http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~zeilberg/tokhniot/inJACK1">input</A>
<br>
gives the 
<br>
<A HREF="http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~zeilberg/tokhniot/oJACK1">output</A>.
<br>
You don't have to be Jack Good to be able to conjecture that this holds for all n,
and then prove it for all n (Good did it with the Lagrange interpolation formula).
<P>
<LI>
To have the computer, guess, and then prove (ab initio) MacMahon's master theorem for two variables,
The
<br>
<A HREF="http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~zeilberg/tokhniot/inJACK2">input</A>
<br>
gives the 
<br>
<A HREF="http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~zeilberg/tokhniot/oJACK2">output</A>.
<br>
You don't have to be a MacMahon to conjecture the recurrence for an arbitrary number of variables, and then prove it.
<P>
<LI>
To have the computer guess, and immediately prove, the positive analog of Dyson's conjecture
for three variables, the
<br>
<A HREF="http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~zeilberg/tokhniot/inJACK3">input</A>
<br>
gives the 
<br>
<A HREF="http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~zeilberg/tokhniot/oJACK3">output</A>.
<br>
Note that the computer was unable (in reasonable time) to find the analogous recurrence
for four variables, and it is unlikely that a uniform description, like 1-m[1] in
the original case, exists.
<P>
<LI>
Another example that does not seem to generalize nicely to many variables is
to find a recurrence for the constant term (or any coefficient for that matter)
of 
<br>
(x1<sup>2</sup>+x1x2+x2<sup>2</sup>)<sup>a1</sup>(x1<sup>2</sup>+x1x3+x3<sup>2</sup>)<sup>a2</sup>
(x2<sup>2</sup>+x2x3+x3<sup>2</sup>)<sup>a3</sup>/(x1<sup>2a3</sup>x2<sup>2a2</sup>x3<sup>2a1</sup>)
