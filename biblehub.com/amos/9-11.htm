as it is written,">Acts 15:15-17</a> is a free reproduction by St. James of the rendering of the LXX. The apostle uses it to show that there was a prophetic promise that after the dispersion of Israel the power and throne of David should be so re-established that it might be a rallying-place of the rest of the nations, "that the residue of men should seek after the Lord" (LXX. "me"). The clause which is quoted shows that the LXX. made their translation from a different Hebrew text from ours, and probably an inferior one. The word for "men" (<span class= "ital">?d?m</span>) was read in place of <span class= "ital">Edom</span> in the Masoretic text. The rendering "seek" can also be accounted for by a slight modification of the Hebrew characters. The remarks of Dr. Stanley Leathes (<span class= "ital">Old Testament Prophecy,</span> p. 70) upon this passage are worthy of attention:--"The Greek text, which the apostle did not make, but found, lent itself even more forcibly than the Hebrew to the peculiar circumstances of the time . . . That he was not speaking critically we are willing to admit, but are we sure that he was bound to do so? At all events, our criticism will best display itself in judging his words according to his standard, and not according to one which, it is plain, he did not follow."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/amos/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11-15.</span> - Part IV. EPILOGUE. THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE NEW KINGDOM AND THE REIGN OF MESSIAH. THE KINGDOM SHALL EMBRACE ALL NATIONS (vers. 11, 12), SHALL BE ENRICHED WITH SUPERABUNDANT SPIRITUAL BLESSINGS (vers. 13, 14), AND SHALL ENDURE FOREVER (ver. 15). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In that day.</span> When the judgment has fallen. The passage is quoted by St. James (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-16.htm">Acts 15:16, 27</a>), mostly from the Greek, in confirmation of the doctrine that the Church of God is open to all, whether Jew or Gentile. <span class="cmt_word">The tabernacle (</span><span class="accented">sukkah</span>): <span class="accented">hut</span>, or <span class="accented">tent</span> (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/4-5.htm">Jonah 4:5</a>); no palace now, but fallen to low esthete, a "little house" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-11.htm">Amos 6:11</a>). The prophet refers probably to the fall of the kingdom of David in the ruin wrought by the Chaldeans. Interpreted spiritually, the passage shadows forth the universal Church of Christ, raised from that of the Jews. Pusey notes that in the Talmud Christ is called "the Son of the fallen." <span class="cmt_word">The breaches.</span> The house of David had sustained breaches under the hands of Jeroboam and Joash, and in the severance of the ten tribes at the hands of Assyriaus and Chaldees; these should be repaired. Unity should be restored, the captives should return, and another kingdom should be established under another David, the Messiah. Judah's temporary prosperity under Uzziah and Hezekiah would have been a totally inadequate fulfilment of the prophecy. Prophecies of the temporal and spiritual are, as usual, blended together and run up into each other. <span class="cmt_word">His ruins.</span> The destroyed places of David! will build it; Hebrew, <span class="accented">her</span>. The whole Jewish Church (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-4.htm">Jeremiah 31:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-7.htm">Jeremiah 33:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">As in the days of old.</span> The days of David and Solomon, the most flourishing times of the kingdom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-11.htm">2 Samuel 7:11, 12, 16</a>). In the expression, "of old," Hebrew, "of eternity," may lurk an idea of the length of time that must elapse before the fulfilment of the promise. Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f7c;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, "I will build it up as are the days of eternity."
