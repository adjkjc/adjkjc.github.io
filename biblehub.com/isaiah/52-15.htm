The "sprinkling" is that of the priest who cleanses the leper (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-6.htm" title="And the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the blood seven times before the LORD, before the veil of the sanctuary.">Leviticus 4:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-17.htm" title="And the priest shall dip his finger in some of the blood, and sprinkle it seven times before the LORD, even before the veil.">Leviticus 4:17</a>), and this was to be done by Him who was Himself counted as a leper "smitten of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-4.htm" title="Surely he has borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.">Isaiah 53:4</a>). We may probably trace an echo of the words in the "sprinkling clean water" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-25.htm" title="Then will I sprinkle clean water on you, and you shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you.">Ezekiel 36:25</a>, in the "blood of sprinkling," of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-22.htm" title="Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water.">Hebrews 10:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-24.htm" title="And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling, that speaks better things that that of Abel.">Hebrews 12:24</a>. Here it comes as an explanation of the paradox that <span class= "ital">the </span>Servant of Jehovah was to bring in "many nations" into the holy city, and yet that the "uncircumcised and unclean" were not to enter it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-1.htm" title="Awake, awake; put on your strength, O Zion; put on your beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city: for from now on there shall no more come into you the uncircumcised and the unclean.">Isaiah 52:1</a>).<p><span class= "bld">The kings shall shut their mouths . . .</span>--The reverence, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-7.htm" title="Thus said the LORD, the Redeemer of Israel, and his Holy One, to him whom man despises, to him whom the nation abhors, to a servant of rulers, Kings shall see and arise, princes also shall worship, because of the LORD that is faithful, and the Holy One of Israel, and he shall choose you.">Isaiah 49:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-9.htm" title="The princes refrained talking, and laid their hand on their mouth.">Job 29:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/40-4.htm" title="Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer you? I will lay my hand on my mouth.">Job 40:4</a>, is that of silent wonder at the change which has passed over the suffering Servant. <a href="https://apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/5-1.htm" title="Then shall the righteous man stand in great boldness before the face of such as have afflicted him, and made no account of his labours.">Wisdom Of Solomon 5:1-5</a> presents an interesting parallel, the reference there being to the person of the ideal righteous sufferer. In that case, as in this, there was, so to speak, a transfiguration "beyond all that men looked for."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/52.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">So shall he sprinkle many nations</span>. The Septuagint has, "So shall many nations marvel at him;" and this translation is followed by Gesenius and Ewald. Mr. Cheyne thinks that the present Hebrew text is corrupt, and suggests that a verb was used antithetical to the "astonied" of ver. 14, expressing "joyful surprise." It is certainly hard to see how the idea of "sprinkling," even if it can mean "purifying," comes in here. <span class="cmt_word">Kings shall shut their mouths at him</span>; rather, <span class="accented">because of him.</span> In reverential awe of his surpassing greatness (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-16.htm">Micah 7:16</a>). That which had not been told them shall they see. They will learn the facts of Christ's humiliation, sufferings, death, resurrection, and ascension to heaven - events that it had never entered into the heart of man to conceive, and of which, therefore, no tongue had ever spoken. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="cred"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/isaiah/52-15.htm">Isaiah
