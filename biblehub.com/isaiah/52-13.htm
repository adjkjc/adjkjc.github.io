The whole must be treated as an entirely distinct section (all the more striking, from its contrast to the triumphant tone of what precedes it), and finds its only adequate explanation in the thought of a new revelation made to the prophet's mind. That may have had, like other revelations, a starting-point in the prophet's own experience. He had seen partially good kings, like Uzziah and Jotham; one who almost realised his ideal of what a king should be, in Hezekiah. None of these had redeemed or regenerated the people. So far as that work had been done at all, it had been through prophets who spake the word of the Lord and were mocked and persecuted because they spake it. Something like a law was dawning upon his mind, and that law was the power of a vicarious suffering, the might of martyrdom in life and death. Did it not follow from this that that ideal must be wrought out on a yet wider scale in the great work of restoration to which he was looking forward? The Servant of the Lord, in all the concentric developments of the thought which the word implied, the nation, the prophetic kernel of the nation, the individual Servant identifying himself with both, must himself also be made perfect through suffering and conquer through apparent failure. Granting that such a law exists, it will be no wonder that we should find examples of its working both before and after the great fulfilment, in Isaiah himself, in Jeremiah, in the exiles of the captivity, in the heroes of the Maccabean struggle, in the saints and martyrs of the Church of Christ. It remains true that the Christ alone fulfils the idea of the perfect sufferer, as He alone fulfils that of the perfect King. Measuring Isaiah from a purely human stand-point, and by the standard of other poets, this manifold symbolism of "the Servant," will hardly seem strange to the student of literature who remembers the many aspects presented by the Beatrice of Dante, the St. George and Gloriana of Spenser, the Piers Plowman of Langland.<p><span class= "bld">Shall deal prudently.</span>--The words imply, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/1-8.htm" title="This book of the law shall not depart out of your mouth; but you shall meditate therein day and night, that you may observe to do according to all that is written therein: for then you shall make your way prosperous, and then you shall have good success.">Joshua 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-21.htm" title="For the pastors are become brutish, and have not sought the LORD: therefore they shall not prosper, and all their flocks shall be scattered.">Jeremiah 10:21</a>, the idea of prospering. The same verb is used of the "righteous branch" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-5.htm" title="Behold, the days come, said the LORD, that I will raise to David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth.">Jeremiah 23:5</a>, and is there so translated.<p><span class= "bld">Shall be exalted.</span>--It is noteworthy that the phrase impressed itself, through the LXX., on the mind of the Christ in reference to His crucifixion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-14.htm" title="And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up:">John 3:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-28.htm" title="Then said Jesus to them, When you have lifted up the Son of man, then shall you know that I am he, and that I do nothing of myself; but as my Father has taught me, I speak these things.">John 8:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-32.htm" title="And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to me.">John 12:32</a>), on that of the Apostles in reference to His ascension (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-33.htm" title="Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he has shed forth this, which you now see and hear.">Acts 2:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-9.htm" title="Why God also has highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:">Philippians 2:9</a>). (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-1.htm" title="In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the LORD sitting on a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple.">Isaiah 6:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-15.htm" title="For thus said the high and lofty One that inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.">Isaiah 57:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-27.htm" title="Also I will make him my firstborn, higher than the kings of the earth.">Psalm 89:27</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/isaiah/52.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 13-15.</span> - PRELUDE TO THE "GREAT PASSIONAL." It is generally allowed by modern commentators that this passage is more closely connected with what follows it than with what precedes. Some would detach it altogether from ch. 52. and attach it to ch. 53. But this is not necessary. The passage has a completeness in itself. It is a connecting link. The exaltation of Israel, the collective "Servant of the Lord" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-1.htm">Isaiah 44:1, 21</a>), brings to the prophet's mind the exaltation of the individual "<span class="accented">Servant"</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-1.htm">Isaiah 42:1-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-10.htm">Isaiah 43:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-1.htm">Isaiah 49:1-12</a>), through which alone the full exaltation of Israel is possible. He is bound to complete his account of the individual "<span class="accented">Servant"</span> by telling of <span class="accented">his</span> exaltation, and of the road which led to it. This is done in ch. 53, in what has been called the "<span class="accented">Great Passional."</span> But the "<span class="accented">Great</span> Pas-signal" needs a "<span class="accented">prelude</span>," an "introduction," if only as indicative' of its greatness. And this prelude we have here, in these three verses, which briefly note <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the fact of the exaltation; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the depth of the humiliation preceding it; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the far-extending blessedness which shall result to the world from both. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">My Servant shall deal prudently</span>; rather, <span class="accented">shall deal wisely</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> shall so act throughout his mission as to secure it the most complete success. "Wisdom is justified of her children," and of none so entirely justified as of him "in whom were all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge hid away" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-3.htm">Colossians 2:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Exalted and extolled</span>; or, <span class="accented">high and lifted</span> up - the same expressions as are used of the Almighty in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-15.htm">Isaiah 57:15</a>. Even there, however, seems to the prophet rot enough; so he adds, "and exalted exceedingly" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-10.htm">Isaiah 53:10-12</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-6.htm">Philippians 2:6-9</a>). <div class="cred"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/isaiah/52-13.htm">Isaiah 52:13 Commentaries</a></div><div class="vheading2">Jump to Previous</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-11.htm">Act</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-8.htm">Deal</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-11.htm">Exalted</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/66-17.htm">Extolled</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-17.htm">Greatly</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-11.htm">High</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-5.htm">Highly</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-23.htm">Honoured</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-8.htm">Lifted</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-15.htm">Prosper</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-25.htm">Prudently</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-11.htm">Raised</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/50-10.htm">Servant</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-15.htm">Undertakings</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-18.htm">Wisely</a><div class="vheading2">Jump to Next</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-6.htm">Act</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-7.htm">Deal</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-7.htm">Exalted</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-18.htm">Extolled</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-10.htm">Greatly</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-9.htm">High</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-25.htm">Highly</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/1-8.htm">Honoured</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-4.htm">Lifted</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-10.htm">Prosper</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-8.htm">Prudently</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-19.htm">Raised</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-11.htm">Servant</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-31.htm">Undertakings</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-21.htm">Wisely</a><div class="vheading2">Links</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/niv/isaiah/52-13.htm">Isaiah 52:13 NIV</a><br /><a href="https://biblehub.com/nlt/isaiah/52-13.htm">Isaiah 52:13 NLT</a><br /><a href="https://biblehub.com/esv/isaiah/52-13.htm">Isaiah 52:13 ESV</a><br /><a href="https://biblehub.com/nasb/isaiah/52-13.htm">Isaiah 52:13 NASB</a><br /><a href="https://biblehub.com/kjv/isaiah/52-13.htm">Isaiah 52:13 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://bibleapps.com/isaiah/52-13.htm">Isaiah 52:13 Bible Apps</a><br /><a href="https://bibliaparalela.com/isaiah/52-13.htm">Isaiah 52:13 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="https://holybible.com.cn/isaiah/52-13.htm">Isaiah 52:13 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="https://saintebible.com/isaiah/52-13.htm">Isaiah 52:13 French Bible</a><br /><a href="https://bibeltext.com/isaiah/52-13.htm">Isaiah 52:13 German Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Alphabetical: act and be Behold exalted greatly he high highly lifted my prosper raised See servant up will wisely<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="52-13.htm">OT Prophets: Isaiah 52:13 Behold my servant shall deal wisely he (Isa Isi Is) Christian Bible Study Resources, Dictionary, Concordance and Search Tools</a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-12.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="Isaiah 52:12"><img src="https://biblehub.com/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="Isaiah 52:12" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="52-14.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="Isaiah 52:14"><img src="https://biblehub.com/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="Isaiah 52:14" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="52-13.htm#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="https://biblehub.com/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="52-13.htm#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="https://biblehub.com/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div>
