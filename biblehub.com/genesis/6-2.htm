<span class= "ital">and they took to them wives whomsoever they chose. </span>Of the sons of the Elohim there are three principal interpretations: the first, that of the Targums and the chief Jewish expositors, that they were the nobles, and men of high rank; the second, that they were angels. St. Jude, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-6.htm" title="And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he has reserved in everlasting chains under darkness to the judgment of the great day.">Jude 1:6</a>, and St. Peter, 2 Ep., <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-4.htm" title="For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to be reserved to judgment;">2Peter 2:4</a>, seem to favour this interpretation, possibly as being the translation of the LXX. according to several MSS. But even if this be their meaning, which is very uncertain, they use it only as an illustration; and a higher authority says that the angels neither marry nor are given in marriage. The third, and most generally accepted interpretation in modern times, is that the sons of the Elohim were the Sethites, and that when they married for mere lust of beauty, universal corruption soon ensued. But no modern commentator has shown how such marriages could produce "mighty men . . . men of renown;" or how strong warriors could be the result of the intermarriage of pious men with women of an inferior race, such as the Cainites are assumed to have been.<p>The Jewish interpreters, who well understood the uses of their own language, are right in the main point that the phrase "sons of the Elohim" conveys no idea of moral goodness or piety. Elohim constantly means <span class= "ital">mighty ones </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-11.htm" title="Who is like to you, O LORD, among the gods? who is like you, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders?">Exodus 15:11</a>, marg.). (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-12.htm" title="For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I am the LORD.">Exodus 12:12</a>, marg., <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-6.htm" title="Then his master shall bring him to the judges; he shall also bring him to the door, or to the door post; and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl; and he shall serve him for ever.">Exodus 21:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/22-8.htm" title="If the thief be not found, then the master of the house shall be brought to the judges, to see whether he have put his hand to his neighbor's goods.">Exodus 22:8-9</a>, where it is translated <span class= "ital">judges; </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-28.htm" title="You shall not revile the gods, nor curse the ruler of your people.">Exodus 22:28</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-25.htm" title="If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but if a man sin against the LORD, who shall entreat for him? Notwithstanding they listened not to the voice of their father, because the LORD would slay them.">1Samuel 2:25</a>, where also it is translated <span class= "ital">judge.</span>) In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-6.htm" title="Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.">Job 1:6</a> the "sons of Elohim" are the nobles, the idea being that of a king who at his durbar gathers his princes round him; and, not unnecessarily to multiply examples, the "sons of the Elim," the other form of the plural, is rightly translated <span class= "ital">mighty ones </span>in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/29-1.htm" title="Give to the LORD, O you mighty, give to the LORD glory and strength.">Psalm 29:1</a>.<p>Who, then, are these "mighty ones?" Before answering this question, let me call attention to the plain teaching of the narrative as to what is meant by the "daughters of men." It says: "When the adam began to multiply, and daughters were born unto them, the sons of the Elohim saw the daughters of the adam . . . and took them wives," &c. But according to every right rule of interpretation, the "daughters of the adam" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born to them,">Genesis 6:1</a> must be the same as the "daughters of the adam" in <a href="6-2.htm" title="That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.">Genesis 6:2</a>, whom the sons of the Elohim married. Now, it seems undeniable that the adam here spoken of were the Sethites. The phrase occurs in the history of Noah, just after giving his descent from Adam; Cain is absolutely passed over, even in the account of the birth of Seth, who is described as Adam's firstborn, such as legally he was. The corruption described is that of the Sethites; for the Cainites have already been depicted as violent and lustful, and their history has been brought to an end. Moreover, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-3.htm" title="And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.">Genesis 6:3</a>, "the adam with whom God will not always strive" is certainly the family of Seth, who, though the chosen people and possessors of the birthright, are nevertheless described as falling into evil ways; and their utter corruption finally is the result of the depravation of their women by a race superior to themselves in muscular vigour and warlike prowess.<p>Where, then, shall we find these men? Certainly among the descendants of Cain. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/4-17.htm" title="And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bore Enoch: and he built a city, and called the name of the city, after the name of his son, Enoch.">Genesis 4:17-24</a>, we find Cain described as the founder of civil institutions and social life: the name he gives to his son testifies to his determination that his race shall be trained men. They advance rapidly in the arts, become rich, refined, luxurious, but also martial and arrogant. The picture terminates in a boastful hero parading himself before his admiring wives, displaying to them his weapons, and vaunting himself in a poem of no mean merit as ten times superior to their forefather Cain. His namesake in the race of Seth also indites a poem; but it is a groan over their hard toil, and the difficulty with which, by incessant labour, they earned their daily bread. To the simple "daughters of the adam," these men, enriched by the possession of implements of metal, playing sweet music on harp and pipe, and rendered invincible by the deadly weapons they had forged, must have seemed indeed as very "sons of the Elohim." The Sethites could not have taken the Cainite women according to their fancy in the way described, protected as they were by armed men; but the whole phrase, "whomsoever they would," reeks of that arrogancy and wantonness of which the polygamist Lamech had set so notable an example. And so, not by the women corrupting nobler natures, but by these strong men acting according to their lust, the race with the birthright sank to the Cainite level, and God had no longer a people on earth worthy of His choice.<p><div class="cred"><a href="../commentaries/genesis/6-2.htm">Genesis 6:2 Commentaries</a></div><div class="vheading2">Jump to Previous</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-19.htm">Beautiful</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-18.htm">Chose</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-14.htm">Chosen</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-1.htm">Daughters</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-14.htm">Fair</a> <a href="../../bit.ly/2AykieR.html">God's</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-19.htm">Married</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-6.htm">Pleasing</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-8.htm">Themselves</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-10.htm">Whomever</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-3.htm">Whomsoever</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-25.htm">Wife</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-23.htm">Wives</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-19.htm">Women</a><div class="vheading2">Jump to Next</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-11.htm">Beautiful</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-11.htm">Chose</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-19.htm">Chosen</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-4.htm">Daughters</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-11.htm">Fair</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-4.htm">God's</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-29.htm">Married</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-4.htm">Pleasing</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-1.htm">Themselves</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-12.htm">Whomever</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-12.htm">Whomsoever</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-18.htm">Wife</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-18.htm">Wives</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-16.htm">Women</a><div class="vheading2">Links</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/niv/genesis/6-2.htm">Genesis 6:2 NIV</a><br /><a href="https://biblehub.com/nlt/genesis/6-2.htm">Genesis 6:2 NLT</a><br /><a href="https://biblehub.com/esv/genesis/6-2.htm">Genesis 6:2 ESV</a><br /><a href="https://biblehub.com/nasb/genesis/6-2.htm">Genesis 6:2 NASB</a><br /><a href="https://biblehub.com/kjv/genesis/6-2.htm">Genesis 6:2 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://bibleapps.com/genesis/6-2.htm">Genesis 6:2 Bible Apps</a><br /><a href="https://bibliaparalela.com/genesis/6-2.htm">Genesis 6:2 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="https://holybible.com.cn/genesis/6-2.htm">Genesis 6:2 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="https://saintebible.com/genesis/6-2.htm">Genesis 6:2 French Bible</a><br /><a href="https://bibeltext.com/genesis/6-2.htm">Genesis 6:2 German Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Alphabetical: and any beautiful chose daughters for God married men of saw sons that the them themselves they took were whomever wives<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="6-2.htm">OT Law: Genesis 6:2 That God's sons saw that men's daughters (Gen.
