God, therefore, in order to win Adam back to better thoughts, carries his mind from the effect to the sin that had caused it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 11, 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he said</span>. "To reprove the sottishness of Adam" (Calvin); "to awaken in him a sense of sin" (Keil). <span class="cmt_word">Who told thee that thou wast naked?</span> Delitzsch finds in <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;</span> an indication that a personal power was the prime cause of man's disobedience; but, as Lange rightly observes, it is the occasion not of sin, but of the consciousness of nakedness that is here inquired after. <span class="cmt_word">Hast thou eaten of the tree</span> (at once pointing Adam to the true cause of his nakedness, and intimating the Divine cognizance of his transgression) <span class="cmt_word">whereof I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat?</span> "Added to remove the pretext of ignorance" (Calvin), and also to aggravate the guilt of his offence, as having been done in direct violation of the Divine prohibition. The question was fitted to carry conviction to Adam's conscience, and halt the instantaneous effect of eliciting a confession, though neither a frank one nor a generous. <span class="cmt_word">And the man said</span> (beginning with apology and ending with confession, thus reversing the natural order, and practically rolling back the blame on God), <span class="cmt_word">The woman whom thou gavest to be with me</span> (accusing the gift and the Giver in one), <span class="cmt_word">she gave me of the tree</span>. Cf. with the cold and unfeeling terms in which Adam speaks of Eve the similar language in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-32.htm">Genesis 37:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-30.htm">Luke 15:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-12.htm">John 9:12</a>. "<span class="accented">Without</span> natural affection" is one of the bitter fruits of sin (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-31.htm">Romans 1:31</a>). Equally with the blasphemy, ingratitude, unkindness, and meanness of this excuse, its frivolity is apparent; as if, though Eve gave, that was any reason why Adam should have eaten. <span class="cmt_word">And I did eat</span>. Reluctantly elicited, the confession of his sin is very mildly stated. "<span class="accented">A</span> cold expression, manifesting neither any grief nor shame at so foul an act, but rather a desire to cover his sin" (White). <div class="cred"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/genesis/3-11.htm">Genesis 3:11 Commentaries</a></div><div class="vheading2">Jump to Previous</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-10.htm">Clothing</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-16.htm">Commanded</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-11.htm">Declared</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-6.htm">Eat</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/10-10.htm">Eaten</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-6.htm">Fruit</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-10.htm">Naked</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-18.htm">Shouldest</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-6.htm">Tree</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-5.htm">Wast</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-3.htm">Whereof</a><div class="vheading2">Jump to Next</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-21.htm">Clothing</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-17.htm">Commanded</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-18.htm">Declared</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-12.htm">Eat</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-17.htm">Eaten</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-12.htm">Fruit</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-42.htm">Naked</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-23.htm">Shouldest</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-12.htm">Tree</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-19.htm">Wast</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-30.htm">Whereof</a><div class="vheading2">Links</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/niv/genesis/3-11.htm">Genesis 3:11 NIV</a><br /><a href="https://biblehub.com/nlt/genesis/3-11.htm">Genesis 3:11 NLT</a><br /><a href="https://biblehub.com/esv/genesis/3-11.htm">Genesis 3:11 ESV</a><br /><a href="https://biblehub.com/nasb/genesis/3-11.htm">Genesis 3:11 NASB</a><br /><a href="https://biblehub.com/kjv/genesis/3-11.htm">Genesis 3:11 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://bibleapps.com/genesis/3-11.htm">Genesis 3:11 Bible Apps</a><br /><a href="https://bibliaparalela.com/genesis/3-11.htm">Genesis 3:11 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="https://holybible.com.cn/genesis/3-11.htm">Genesis 3:11 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="https://saintebible.com/genesis/3-11.htm">Genesis 3:11 French Bible</a><br /><a href="https://bibeltext.com/genesis/3-11.htm">Genesis 3:11 German Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Alphabetical: And commanded eat eaten from Have he I naked not of said that the to told tree were which Who you<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="3-11.htm">OT Law: Genesis 3:11 God said Who told you that you (Gen.
