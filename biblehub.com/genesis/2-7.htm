So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-19.htm" title="And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them to Adam to see what he would call them: and whatever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof.">Genesis 2:19</a> Jehovah forms the animals, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-8.htm" title="And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there he put the man whom he had formed.">Genesis 2:8</a> He plants a garden. As Elohim is almighty power, so Jehovah is wisdom and skill, and His works are full of contrivance and design. As regards man's body, Jehovah forms it <span class= "ital">dust from the ground: </span>the <span class= "ital">adamah, </span>or fruitful arable soil, so called from Adam, for whose use it was specially fitted, and by whom it was first tilled. But the main intention of the words is to point out man's feebleness. He is made not from the rocks, nor from ores of metal, but from the light, shifting particles of the surface, blown about by every wind. Yet, frail as is man's body, God--<p><span class= "bld">. . . breathed into his nostrils the breath of life.</span>--The life came not as the result of man's bodily organisation, nor as derived by evolution from any other animal, but as a gift direct from God.<p><span class= "bld">And man became a living soul.</span>--The word translated "soul" contains no idea of a spiritual existence. For in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-20.htm" title="And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that has life, and fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.">Genesis 1:20</a>, "creature that hath life," and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-24.htm" title="And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.">Genesis 1:24</a>, "the living creature," are literally, <span class= "ital">living soul. </span>Really the word refers to the natural life of animals and men, maintained by breathing, or in some way extracting oxygen from the atmospheric air. And whatever superiority over other animals may be possessed by man comes from the manner in which this living breath was bestowed upon him, and not from his being "a living soul;" for that is common to all alike.<p>The whole of this second narrative is pre-eminently anthropomorphic. In the previous history Elohim commands, and it is done. Here He forms, and builds, and plants, and breathes into His work, and is the companion and friend of the creature He has made. It thus sets before us the love and tenderness of Jehovah, who provides for man a home, fashions for him a wife to be his partner and helpmate, rejoices in his intellect, and brings the lower world to him to see what he will call them, and even after the fall provides the poor outcasts with clothing. It is a picture fitted for the infancy of mankind, and speaking the language of primaeval simplicity. But its lesson is for all times. For it proclaims the love of God to man, his special pre-eminence in the scale of being, and that Elohim, the Almighty Creator, is Jehovah-Elohim, the friend and counsellor of the creature whom He has endowed with reason and free-will.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/genesis/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the Lord God</span> (Jehovah Elohim) <span class="cmt_word">formed man of the dust of the ground.</span> Literally, dust from the ground. Here, again, Bleek, Kalisch, and the theologians of their school discover contrariety between this account of man's creation and that which has been given in the preceding chapter. <span class="accented">In that</span> man is represented as having been created by the Divine word, in the Divine image, and male and female simultaneously; whereas <span class="accented">in this</span> his creation is exhibited as a painful process of elaboration from the clay by the hand of God, who works it like a potter (<span class="accented">asah</span>; LXX., <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span>), and, after having first constructed man, by a subsequent operation forms woman. But the first account does not assert that Adam and Eve were created together, and gives no details of the formation of either. These are supplied by the present narrative, which, beginning with the construction of his body from the fine dust of the ground, designedly represents it as an evolution or development of the material universe, and ends by setting it before us as animated by the breath of God, reserving for later treatment the mode of Eve's production, when the circumstances that led to it have been described. <span class="cmt_word">And</span> (the Lord God) <span class="cmt_word">breathed into his nostrils the breath of life.</span> Literally, the breath of lives. "The formation of man from the dust and the breathing of the breath of life must not be understood in a mechanical sense, as if God first of all constructed a human figure from the dust" (still less does it admit of the idea that man's physical nature was evolved from the lower animals), "and then, by breathing his breath of life into the clod of earth which he had shaped into the form of a man, made it into a living being. The words are to be understood <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>. By an act of Divine omnipotence man arose from the dust; and in the same moment in which the dust, by virtue of creative omnipotence, shaped itself into a human form, it was pervaded by the Divine breath of life, and created a living being, so that we cannot say the body was earlier than the soul" (Delitzsch). <span class="cmt_word">And man became a</span> <span class="cmt_word">living soul</span>. <span class="accented">Nephesh chayyah</span>, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-21.htm">Genesis 1:21</a>, 80, is employed to designate the lower animals. Describing a being animated by a <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span> or life principle, it does not necessarily imply that the basis of the life principle in man and the inferior animals is the same. The distinction between the two appears from the difference in the mode of their creations. The beasts arose at the almighty fiat completed beings, every one a <span class="accented">nephesh chayyah</span>. "The origin of their soul was coincident with that of their corporeality, and their life was merely the individualization of the universal life with which all matter was filled at the beginning by the Spirit of God" (Delitzsch). Man received his life from a distinct act of Divine inbreathing; certainly not an in-breathing of atmospheric air, but an inflatus from the Ruach Elohim, or Spirit of God, a communication from the whole personality of the Godhead. In effect man was thereby constituted a <span class="accented">nephesh chayyah</span>, like the lower animals; but in him the life principle conferred a personality which was wanting in them. Thus there is no real contradiction, scarcely even an "<span class="accented">apparent</span> dissonance," between the two accounts of man's creation. The second exhibits the foundation of that likeness to God and world-dominion ascribed to him in the first. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <div class="cred"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7 Commentaries</a></div><div class="vheading2">Jump to Previous</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-30.htm">Breath</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-10.htm">Breathed</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-9.htm">Breatheth</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-1.htm">Breathing</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-24.htm">Creature</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-19.htm">Dust</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-6.htm">Earth</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-4.htm">Elohim</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-10.htm">Formed</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-1.htm">Formeth</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-6.htm">Ground</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-30.htm">Life</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-17.htm">Nostrils</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-30.htm">Soul</a><div class="vheading2">Jump to Next</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-17.htm">Breath</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-8.htm">Breathed</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-16.htm">Breatheth</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-16.htm">Breathing</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-19.htm">Creature</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-14.htm">Dust</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-19.htm">Earth</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-8.htm">Elohim</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-8.htm">Formed</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-18.htm">Formeth</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-9.htm">Ground</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-9.htm">Life</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/7-22.htm">Nostrils</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-10.htm">Soul</a><div class="vheading2">Links</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/niv/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7 NIV</a><br /><a href="https://biblehub.com/nlt/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7 NLT</a><br /><a href="https://biblehub.com/esv/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7 ESV</a><br /><a href="https://biblehub.com/nasb/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7 NASB</a><br /><a href="https://biblehub.com/kjv/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://bibleapps.com/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7 Bible Apps</a><br /><a href="https://bibliaparalela.com/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="https://holybible.com.cn/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="https://saintebible.com/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7 French Bible</a><br /><a href="https://bibeltext.com/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7 German Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Alphabetical: a and became being breath breathed dust formed from God ground his into life living LORD man nostrils of the Then<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="2-7.htm">OT Law: Genesis 2:7 Yahweh God formed man from the dust (Gen.
