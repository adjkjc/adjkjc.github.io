This verse is not a mere repetition of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_thessalonians/2-9.htm" title="Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,">2Thessalonians 2:9-10</a>. <span class= "ital">There</span> we were told of external dangers which would attend Antichrist's coming for them that perish: because they had not cared for truth, therefore the presence of the Man of Sin, which could not even imperil the truth-lovers, would for them be full of special marvels and frauds by which they might be misled. <span class= "ital">Here</span> is set forth the effect upon their own <span class= "ital">selves</span> of refusing to accept God's gift of love of truth: God takes from them (by His natural law) their power of discerning the true from the false, and thus (as it were) actually deceives them. Every wilful sin does this double mischief: it strengthens the power of the temptation without; it weakens the power to resist within. For an illustration, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-7.htm" title="And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man, by whom we may inquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for he never prophesied good to me, but always evil: the same is Micaiah the son of Imla. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so.">2Chronicles 18:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/18-22.htm" title="Now therefore, behold, the LORD has put a lying spirit in the mouth of these your prophets, and the LORD has spoken evil against you.">2Chronicles 18:22</a> : Ahab cares only for the pleasant, not the true, and the Lord requites him by sending forth a lying spirit to entice him.<p><span class= "bld">Shall send.</span>--The Greek has <span class= "ital">sendeth</span>: so "is" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-9.htm" title="Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,">2Thessalonians 2:9</a> : St. Paul sees it all going on before his eyes. "A strong delusion" should be "an effectual inward working of error"--no longer a mere indifference to truth, but a real influence of error upon their hearts. This inward work of error is sent "with a view to their believing <span class= "ital">the</span> lie" (the Greek has the definite article)--the lie (that is) which Antichrist would have them believe. A terrible combination when God and Satan are agreed to deceive a man! Yet what an encouragement to see God using Satan for His own purposes.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_thessalonians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For this cause;</span> on account of their being destitute of a love of the truth. <span class="cmt_word">God shall send them;</span> or rather, <span class="accented">God sends them</span>; the present being chosen because the apostasy had already commenced, the mystery of lawlessness was already working. <span class="cmt_word">Strong delusion;</span> or, <span class="accented">a working of error</span> (R.V.). These words are not to be weakened, as if they meant merely that in righteous judgment God permitted strong delusion to be sent them; the words are not a mere assertion of judicial permission, but of actual retribution. It is the ordinance of God that the wicked by their wicked actions fall into greater wickedness, and that thus sin is punished by sin; and what is an ordinance of God is appointed by God himself. <span class="cmt_word">That they should believe a lie;</span> or rather, <span class="accented">the lie</span>, namely the falsehood which the man of sin disseminates by his deceit of unrighteousness. Being destitute of the love of the truth, they are necessarily led to believe a lie - their minds are open to all manner of falsehood and delusion. <div class="cred"><a
