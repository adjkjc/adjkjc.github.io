<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.</p>

<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>And the twelve gates were twelve pearls: every several gate was of one pearl: and the street of the city was pure gold, as it were transparent glass.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are the temple of it.
