<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/catholic/revelation/21-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>And I, John, saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/catholic/revelation/21-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>And I heard a great voice from the throne, saying: Behold the tabernacle of God with men: and he will dwell with them. And they shall be his people: and God himself with them shall be their God. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/catholic/revelation/21-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes: and death shall be no more. Nor mourning, nor crying, nor sorrow shall be any more, for the former things are passed away.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/catholic/revelation/21-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>And he that sat on the throne, said: Behold, I make all things new. And he said to me: Write. For these words are most faithful and true.
