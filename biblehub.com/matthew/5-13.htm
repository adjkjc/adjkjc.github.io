The general reference to this antiseptic action of salt is (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-6.htm" title=" Let your speech be always with grace, seasoned with salt, that you may know how you ought to answer every man.">Colossians 4:6</a>, and possibly in the symbolic act of Elisha, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-21.htm" title="And he went forth to the spring of the waters, and cast the salt in there, and said, Thus said the LORD, I have healed these waters; there shall not be from there any more death or barren land.">2Kings 2:21</a>) enough to give an adequate meaning to the words, but the special reference to the sacrificial use of salt in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-49.htm" title="For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt.">Mark 9:49</a> (see Note there) makes it probable enough that there was some allusion to that thought also here.<p><span class= "bld">If the salt have lost his savour.</span>--The salt commonly used by the Jews of old, as now, came from <span class= "ital">Jebel-Usdum,</span> on the shores of the Dead Sea, and was known as the Salt of Sodom. Maundrell, the Eastern traveller (circ. A.D. 1690), reports that he found lumps of rock-salt there which had become partially flavourless, but I am not aware that this has been confirmed by recent travellers. Common salt, as is well known, will melt if exposed to moisture, but does not lose its saltness. The question is more curious than important, and does not affect the ideal case represented in our Lord's words.<p><span class= "bld">Wherewith shall it be salted?</span>--The words imply a relative if not an absolute impossibility. If gifts, graces, blessings, a high calling, and a high work fail, what remains? The parable finds its interpretation in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/6-1.htm" title="Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on to perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,">Hebrews 6:1-6</a>.<p><span class= "bld">To be trodden under foot of men.</span>--The Talmud shows (Schottgen <span class= "ital">in loc.</span>) that the salt which had become unfit for sacrificial use in the store-house was sprinkled in wet weather upon the slopes and steps of the temple to prevent the feet of the priests from slipping, and we may accordingly see in our Lord's words a possible reference to this practice.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye are the salt</span>, etc. (cf. a similar saying in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-50.htm">Mark 9:50</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/14-34.htm">Luke 14:34, 35</a>). Weiss thinks that St. Luke gives it in its original context; that St. Matthew is right in interpreting it as of special reference to the disciples; and that St. Mark applies it the most freely. It may, indeed, be that its position here is only the result of the inspired guidance of the evangelist; but, on the whole, it seems more probable that so natural a figure was used more than once by our Lord, and that he really spoke these words in his sermon on the mount, as well as on the later occasion indicated by St. Luke. <span class="accented">Ye</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;</span> of ver. 1. <span class="accented">Are</span>, in fact (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;</span>); therefore recognize the responsibility. <span class="accented">The salt of the earth.</span> It has been disputed whether allusion is here made to the preservative properties of salt or to the flavour it imparts; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> whether Christ is thinking of his disciples as preserving the world from decay, or as giving it a good flavour to the Divine taste. Surely a useless question; forgetful of the fact that spiritual realities are being dealt with, and that it is therefore impossible for the one effect to be really separated from the other. Our Lord is thinking of the moral tone which his disciples are to give to humanity. The connexion with vers. 11, 12 is - Persecution must be borne unless you are to lose your moral tone, which is to be to the earth what salt is to its surroundings, preserving from corruption and fitting for (in your case Divine) appreciation. What <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> is to be to the Christian <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-6.htm">Colossians 4:6</a>), that the Christian himself is to be to the world. <span class="cmt_word">If... have lost its savour</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x1fc7;</span>); so elsewhere in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/14-34.htm">Luke 14:34</a> only. Salt that has lost its distinctive qualities is here said to lack its proper mind or sense. Salt without sharpness is like an <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>; for man is a <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>. On the fact of salt losing its virtue, cf. Thomson ('Land and the Book,' p. 382: 1887), "It is a well-known fact that the salt <span class="accented">of this country</span> [<span class="accented">i.e.</span> Palestine] when in contact with the ground, or exposed to rain and sun, does become insipid and useless. From the manner in which it is gathered [<span class="accented">vide infra</span>], much earth and other impurities are necessarily collected with it. Not a little of it is so impure that it cannot be used at all; and such salt soon effloresces and turns to dust - not to fruitful soil, however. It is not only good for nothing itself, but it actually destroys all fertility wherever it is thrown.... No man will allow it to be thrown on to his field, and the only place for it is the street; and there it is cast, to be trodden under foot of men." It should be observed that the salt used in Palestine is not manufactured by boiling clean salt water, nor quarried from mines, but is obtained from marshes along the seashore, as in Cyprus, or from salt lakes in the interior, which dry up in summer, as the one in the desert north of Palmyra, and the great Lake of Jebbul, south-east of Aleppo. Further, rock-salt is found in abundance at the south end of the Dead Sea (cf. Thomson, <span class="accented">loc. cit</span>). <span class="cmt_word">Wherewith shall it be salted?</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> not if you will not act as salt, wherewith shall the earth be salted? (apparently Luther and Erasmus); but what quality can take the place of moral tone to produce in you the same result? You are as salt. If you lose your distinctive qualities, where, can you find that which answers to them? <span class="cmt_word">It is thenceforth good for nothing.</span> Our Lord here lays stress, not on want of fitness (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f54;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, Luke), but on want of inherent power. "It is only useful for that purpose to which one applies what is absolutely useless" (Weiss-Meyer). <div class="cred"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/matthew/5-13.htm">Matthew 5:13 Commentaries</a></div><div class="vheading2">Jump to Previous</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-12.htm">Cast</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-5.htm">Earth</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-8.htm">Except</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/4-3.htm">Feet</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-11.htm">Fit</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-11.htm">Flavor</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-6.htm">Foot</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-4.htm">Goes</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-23.htm">Good</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-14.htm">Insipid</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-5.htm">Lose</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-11.htm">Lost</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/129-8.htm">Passers</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-13.htm">Regain</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-9.htm">Salt</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-4.htm">Salted</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/14-34.htm">Saltiness</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/14-34.htm">Saltness</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-34.htm">Salty</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-10.htm">Savor</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-20.htm">Savour</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-6.htm">Tasteless</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-7.htm">Thenceforth</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-12.htm">Thrown</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-15.htm">Trampled</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/4-3.htm">Trodden</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-12.htm">Way</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/2-5.htm">Wherewith</a><div class="vheading2">Jump to Next</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-25.htm">Cast</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-18.htm">Earth</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-20.htm">Except</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-35.htm">Feet</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-8.htm">Fit</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-6.htm">Flavor</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-35.htm">Foot</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-19.htm">Goes</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-16.htm">Good</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-6.htm">Insipid</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-30.htm">Lose</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-6.htm">Lost</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/129-8.htm">Passers</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-51.htm">Regain</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-49.htm">Salt</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-49.htm">Salted</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-50.htm">Saltiness</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-50.htm">Saltness</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-50.htm">Salty</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/14-34.htm">Savor</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/14-34.htm">Savour</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-50.htm">Tasteless</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/13-9.htm">Thenceforth</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-25.htm">Thrown</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-5.htm">Trampled</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-5.htm">Trodden</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-16.htm">Way</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-5.htm">Wherewith</a><div class="vheading2">Links</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/niv/matthew/5-13.htm">Matthew 5:13 NIV</a><br /><a href="https://biblehub.com/nlt/matthew/5-13.htm">Matthew 5:13 NLT</a><br /><a href="https://biblehub.com/esv/matthew/5-13.htm">Matthew 5:13 ESV</a><br /><a href="https://biblehub.com/nasb/matthew/5-13.htm">Matthew 5:13 NASB</a><br /><a href="https://biblehub.com/kjv/matthew/5-13.htm">Matthew 5:13 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://bibleapps.com/matthew/5-13.htm">Matthew 5:13 Bible Apps</a><br /><a href="https://bibliaparalela.com/matthew/5-13.htm">Matthew 5:13 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="https://holybible.com.cn/matthew/5-13.htm">Matthew 5:13 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="https://saintebible.com/matthew/5-13.htm">Matthew 5:13 French Bible</a><br /><a href="https://bibeltext.com/matthew/5-13.htm">Matthew 5:13 German Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Alphabetical: again and anything are be become But by can earth except foot for good has how if is it its longer loses made men no of out salt saltiness salty tasteless the thrown to trampled under You<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="5-13.htm">NT Gospels: Matthew 5:13 You are the salt of the earth (Matt.
