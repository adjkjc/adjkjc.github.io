That to the <span class= "ital">manna</span> is indeed obvious. Israel ate manna in the wilderness, and died; the Father gives the true bread from heaven that a man may eat thereof and not die. The Son is that Bread of Life. He that eateth Him, even he shall live by Him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-35.htm" title="And Jesus said to them, I am the bread of life: he that comes to me shall never hunger; and he that believes on me shall never thirst.">John 6:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-48.htm" title="I am that bread of life.">John 6:48</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-57.htm" title="As the living Father has sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eats me, even he shall live by me.">John 6:57</a>)--live, even though like Antipas he die; for a man's life consists not in the abundance of things which he possesses, but in the moral qualities which go to make up his character; and spiritual gifts are the food of these moral qualities, and these gifts are through Christ. But the promise is of <span class= "ital">hidden</span> manna. Is the allusion to the pot of manna which had been laid up in the ark? There is no doubt that the Jews long cherished the belief that the ark and sacred treasures of the Temple had not perished. There was a fondly-held tradition that they had been buried by Jeremiah in a safe and secret spot on "the mountain where Moses climbed and saw the heritage of God, until the time that God shall gather His people again together, and show them His mercy" (<a href="https://apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/2-4.htm" title="It was also contained in the same writing, that the prophet, being warned of God, commanded the tabernacle and the ark to go with him, as he went forth into the mountain, where Moses climbed up, and saw the heritage of God.">2 Maccabees 2:4</a>; <a href="https://apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/2-7.htm" title="Which when Jeremy perceived, he blamed them, saying, As for that place, it shall be unknown until the time that God gather his people again together, and receive them unto mercy.">2 Maccabees 2:7</a>). This "hidden manna," so longed for by an afflicted race, may have suggested the use of the word "hidden"; but the sacred writer would become anxious to bring out the spiritual truth that the fountains of Christian life are hidden (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-3.htm" title=" For you are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.">Colossians 3:3</a>), the world knoweth us not. Like the fire in the Interpreter's house, men may try to quench it, but a hidden hand pours in secretly the food of the fuel. More difficult is the meaning of the white stone, graven with the new name. Some see in it an allusion to the Urim and Thummim; and therefore take it to indicate the "priestly dignity of the victorious Christian." In favour of this, it may be noted that it gives unity to the blessing. Manna and the precious stones worn by the high-priest are both wilderness and Jewish illustrations. Against it, however, must be set the fact that the word here rendered "stone" is never so applied, a different word being used both in the LXX. and in this book to denote a precious stone. Another suggestion, which is, perhaps, less encumbered with difficulty, is that the reference is to the stone or pebble of friendship, called <span class= "ital">tessera hospitalis, </span>graven with some legend or device; and which gave to its possessor a claim of hospitality from him who gave it. Some such tickets admitted those invited into the heathen temples on festival days, when the meat which had been offered as a sacrifice formed part of the feast. The stone is called <span class= "ital">white;</span> but the word does not imply that it is a stone of white colour, but that it is shining, glistering white. On the stone is graven a new name. The giving of new names is not uncommon in the Bible: for example, Abraham, Israel, Boanerges, Peter. The new name expressed the step which had been taken into a higher, truer life, and the change of heart and the elevation of character consequent upon it. Such are known in the world by their daily life, their business, their character; they are known above by the place they hold, and the work (the real character of which is quite unknown to the world) they are doing in the great war against evil. No man knoweth the characteristics of the growth of the character, the spiritual conflict in which the work is done, and the features of that change which has been, and is being wrought, except he who experiences the love, the grace, and the tribulation by which his spirit-life has grown.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He that hath an ear</span> (see notes on ver. 7). <span class="cmt_word">To him that overcometh</span>. Again it is made clear that the individual can free himself from the corruption and condemnation of his Church. He may live in the very abode of Satan, and within hearing of damnable doctrines; yet if he overcomes the wiles of Satan, and listens to the Spirit rather than to the seducers, "he shall eat of the hidden manna which restores the spirit that the flesh pots of Egypt have weakened. He shall have the white stone of absolution, the true spiritual emancipation, which the Balaamite and Nicolaitan emancipation has counterfeited" (F.D. Maurice). "The manna, the hidden manna" (see notes on ver. 13), is differently explained: by the repetition of the article, the epithet "hidden" is made very distinct. There is probably some allusion to the manna stored up in the ark in the holy of holies (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-33.htm">Exodus 16:33</a>), and also to the true Bread from heaven, whose presence is now hidden from us; or the reference may be to the loss of the ark, with its contents, when Nebuchadnezzar took Jerusalem (2 Esdr. 10:22). There was a tradition that Jeremiah had hidden the manna, and that it would be brought to light again in the Messianic kingdom. A share in those things which eye saw not, and ear heard not, and to the heart of man never occurred (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-9.htm">1 Corinthians 2:9</a>), will be granted to the conqueror - a foretaste of them here, and a full participation hereafter (comp. <a href="22-4.htm">Revelation 22:4</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-2.htm">1 John 3:2</a>). "To eat" (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>) is an insertion into the true text borrowed from ver. 7. <span class="cmt_word">I will give him a white stone, and upon the stone</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x1fc6;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">a new name written</span>. "White" and "new," as Trench points out, are keywords in the Apocalypse; and it is natural that they should be so. White is "the livery of heaven," where white robes, white clouds, white horses, and white thrones abound (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-14.htm">Revelation 1:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-4.htm">Revelation 3:4, 5, 18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-4.htm">Revelation 4:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-2.htm">Revelation 6:2, 11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-9.htm">Revelation 7:9, 13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-14.htm">Revelation 14:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-11.htm">Revelation 19:11, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-11.htm">Revelation 20:11</a>). And "new" is almost as frequent as "white" in the book which tells of a new heaven and a new earth, in which is the new Jerusalem; where the inhabitants have a new name, and sing a new song, and where all things are made new (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-12.htm">Revelation 3:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-9.htm">Revelation 5:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-3.htm">Revelation 14:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-1.htm">Revelation 21:1, 2, 5</a>). But in spite of the familiarity and appropriateness of the two epithets, "white" and "new," a sure interpretation of the white stone with the new name upon it cannot be found. Trench's dictum, that "this book moves exclusively within the circle of sacred, that is, of Jewish imagery and symbols," and that an allusion to heathen or profane customs is inadmissible, is arbitrary and cannot be proved. As already shown, there may be references to the rites of Dionysus, to the games, and to the crown placed on the corpse of a victor. Here there may be an allusion to the white pebble of acquittal used in courts of justice, or to the lot used in elections; and the word <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x1fc6;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> favours these views. Or again, the reference may be to the <span class="accented">tossers</span>, or ticket, which the victor in the games received to admit him to the tables where he was fed at the public expense. Among Jewish symbols a reference to the "stone with seven eyes" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-9.htm">Zechariah 3:9</a>) seems to be quite out of place. Nevertheless, Trench's explanation of the "white stone" as an allusion to the Urim and Thummim, which the high priest wore behind the square breastplate of judgment has much that is very attractive. This precious thing may well have been a diamond, for there was no diamond among the twelve stones of the breastplate. On each of these stones was written the name of a tribe; but what was written on the Urim none but the high priest knew. The usual supposition is that it was the sacred Tetragrammaton - the ineffable name of God. All this seems to fit in singularly well with the present passage. But if this explanation is to hold, <span class="accented">"he</span> that receiveth it" must mean he that receiveth the white stone, rather than he that receiveth the new name. The "new name" is not a fresh name for himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/62-2.htm">Isaiah 62:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-15.htm">Isaiah 65:15</a>), but a fresh revelation of God's Name and nature, which only those who have received it can comprehend (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-1.htm">Revelation 14:1</a>; <a href="19-12.htm">Revelation 19:12</a>). A variety of other explanations will be found in the 'Speaker's Commentary,' Smith's 'Dictionary of the Bible,' art. "Stones," in Alford, and elsewhere. Whatever the allusion maybe, the general sense is clear. He that overcometh shall be admitted to the heavenly holy of holies, and to a glory and knowledge incomprehensible to those who have not experienced it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-9.htm">1 Corinthians 2:9</a>). He shall be made a priest unto God. <div class="cred"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/revelation/2-17.htm">Revelation 2:17 Commentaries</a></div><div class="vheading2">Jump to Previous</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-11.htm">Assemblies</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-11.htm">Churches</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-11.htm">Ear</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-11.htm">Ears</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-14.htm">Eat</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-27.htm">Excepted</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-16.htm">Give</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-11.htm">Hear</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-11.htm">Heed</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-12.htm">Hidden</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-4.htm">Manna</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_john/1-5.htm">New</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-11.htm">Overcomes</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-11.htm">Overcometh</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/3_john/1-9.htm">Receives</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/3_john/1-9.htm">Receiveth</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-5.htm">Saving</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-11.htm">Spirit</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-8.htm">Stone</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-14.htm">White</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-3.htm">Written</a><div class="vheading2">Jump to Next</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-23.htm">Assemblies</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-23.htm">Churches</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-29.htm">Ear</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-29.htm">Ears</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-20.htm">Eat</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-27.htm">Excepted</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-23.htm">Give</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-29.htm">Hear</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-29.htm">Heed</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-14.htm">Hidden</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-15.htm">Manna</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-12.htm">New</a> <a href="2-26.htm">Overcomes</a> <a href="2-26.htm">Overcometh</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-9.htm">Receives</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-9.htm">Receiveth</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-19.htm">Saving</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-29.htm">Spirit</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-3.htm">Stone</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-4.htm">White</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-1.htm">Written</a><div class="vheading2">Links</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/niv/revelation/2-17.htm">Revelation 2:17 NIV</a><br /><a href="https://biblehub.com/nlt/revelation/2-17.htm">Revelation 2:17 NLT</a><br /><a href="https://biblehub.com/esv/revelation/2-17.htm">Revelation 2:17 ESV</a><br /><a href="https://biblehub.com/nasb/revelation/2-17.htm">Revelation 2:17 NASB</a><br /><a href="https://biblehub.com/kjv/revelation/2-17.htm">Revelation 2:17 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://bibleapps.com/revelation/2-17.htm">Revelation 2:17 Bible Apps</a><br /><a href="https://bibliaparalela.com/revelation/2-17.htm">Revelation 2:17 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="https://holybible.com.cn/revelation/2-17.htm">Revelation 2:17 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="https://saintebible.com/revelation/2-17.htm">Revelation 2:17 French Bible</a><br /><a href="https://bibeltext.com/revelation/2-17.htm">Revelation 2:17 German Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Alphabetical: a also an and but churches ear give has He hear hidden him I it it' known knows let manna name new no of on one only overcomes receives says some Spirit stone the to what which white who will with written<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="2-17.htm">NT Prophecy: Revelation 2:17 He who has an ear let him (Rev.
