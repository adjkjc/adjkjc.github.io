A large proportion of these are drawn away in the train of evil; they are cast down from their high position of noble opportunities of good work and great work; they are dragged down from the height of the grandest possibilities of good to the low level of a life enslaved to evil.<p><span class= "bld">And the</span> <span class= "bld">dragon.</span>--Translate, <span class= "ital">And the dragon stands</span> (not "stood") <span class= "ital">before the woman who is about to bring forth, that whenever she has brought forth he may devour her child</span>. The spirit of evil is represented as ever on the watch to destroy the first tokens of better things. Our minds go back to the hatred and fear of Pharaoh, setting a watch for the offspring of Israel and ordering their destruction; and even more are we reminded of the jealous hatred of Herod seeking the life of the infant Christ. It seems clear that it is on this last incident that the present vision is primarily built up; but its meaning is much wider than this. It shows us that evermore, as Herod waited to destroy Christ, the devil, the old spirit whose malignity wrought through the fears of Pharaoh and of Herod, is on the watch to destroy every token of good and every resemblance to Christ in the world. The mission of the Church is to bring forth in her members this life of Christ before men: the aim of the wicked spirit is to destroy that life. The same hostility which was shown to the infant Christ is active against His children: "If they have persecuted Me, they will also persecute you."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth</span>; <span class="accented">draweth</span> (Revised Version). Not the <span class="accented">stars</span> with which the woman is crowned (see ver. 1), but other <span class="accented">stars.</span> In describing the vast power of the devil, St. John seems to allude to the tremendous result of his rebellious conduct in heaven, in effecting the fall of other angels with himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-6.htm">Jude 1:6</a>). The seer does not here interrupt his narrative to explain the point, but returns to it after ver. 6, and there describes briefly the origin and cause of the enmity of the devil towards God. The <span class="accented">third part</span> (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/8-7.htm">Revelation 8:7</a>, <span class="accented">et seq.</span>) signifies a considerable number, but not the larger part. <span class="cmt_word">And the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born;</span> <span class="accented">which was about to be delivered, that when she was delivered, he might devour her child</span> (Revised Version). A graphic picture of what is true of Christ himself of the Church, both Jewish and Christian, and of every individual member of the Church. This is another example of the personal history of Christ being repeated in the history of his Church. The devil, in the person of Herod, attempts to prevent the salvation of the world; through Pharaoh he endeavours to crush the chosen people of God, through whom the Messiah was to bless all the earth; by means of the power of Rome he labours to exterminate the infant Church of Christ. <div class="cred"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/revelation/12-4.htm">Revelation 12:4
