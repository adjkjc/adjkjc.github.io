Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/1-14.htm" title="His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire;">Revelation 1:14-16</a>. There is no doubt who is before us in this vision. These <span class= "ital">flame-like eyes</span> have been fixed upon the moving scenes of human life, and have been reading the hearts of men, and the true meaning of all events and actions. All things have been naked and open to the eyes of Him with Whom we have to do" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-13.htm" title="Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight: but all things are naked and opened to the eyes of him with whom we have to do.">Hebrews 4:13</a>). He wears many <span class= "ital">crowns</span>--diadems--crowns rather of royalty than of victory. Some have thought that the crowns He wears are crowns taken from the heads of the kings who have made war with Him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/19-12.htm" title="His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself.">Revelation 19:12-13</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-19.htm" title="And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse, and against his army.">Revelation 19:19</a>). It is needless to suppose this; their crowns were His before they were discrowned. The diadems He wears proclaim that not only over a worldwide empire He is king, but of all nations He is truly king. He is not as an emperor among kings, the head of a federation of princedoms; but He is truly King--King of history, King of life, King of human hearts, King everywhere, over each realm and over all realms, King of kings, and Lord of lords. He has <span class= "ital">names written, and a name.</span> The clause having "names written" is omitted in the English version. The authority for its insertion is not entirely satisfactory; but perhaps the balance of evidence is in its favour. He has many names which may be understood, besides a name which no one knows. This is fitting in One who is known to men as Shepherd, Redeemer, Saviour, Prince of Life, but the fulness of Whose love and power none can exhaust, and the depth of Whose wisdom none can fathom. "He knows our names. Thanks be to God, we cannot fathom the depths of His." There is more yet to be known of Him in the world to which we go. His vesture is dipped in blood. The prophet Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-2.htm" title="Why are you red in your apparel, and your garments like him that treads in the winefat?">Isaiah 63:2</a>) probably supplied the foundation of this description. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-15.htm" title="And out of his mouth goes a sharp sword, that with it he should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of iron: and he treads the wine press of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God.">Revelation 19:15</a>.) The blood-red vesture is a fit token of the work. He comes to destroy those that destroy the earth--to tread the winepress of the wrath of God; but we cannot forget that He who comes for this came first to shed His own blood. He is, too, "The Word of God." Again we hear this name; it is a name which is, besides other things, significant of Christ's mediating work. He is the Word who was with God, who was God, and who declares God to man. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.">John 1:1-4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-13.htm" title="And no man has ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of man which is in heaven.">John 3:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-9.htm" title="Jesus said to him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet have you not known me, Philip? he that has seen me has seen the Father; and how say you then, Show us the Father?">John 14:9</a>.) The title the Word, the Word of God--used here and in the Gospel of St. John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-2.htm" title="Who bore record of the word of God, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw.">Revelation 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-1.htm" title="In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.">John 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-1.htm" title="That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked on, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life;">1John 1:1</a>)--is a token of their common authorship. (See <span class= "ital">Introduction</span> and <span class= "ital">Excursus A: The Doctrine of the Word, </span>in Commentary on the Gospel.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">His eyes were as a flame of fire;</span> <span class="accented">and his eyes</span> [<span class="accented">are</span>] <span class="accented">a flame of fire.</span> Again as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-13.htm">Revelation 1:13</a>. "Fire" is the type of purity and judgment (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/97-3.htm">Psalm 97:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-14.htm">Isaiah 47:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-15.htm">Isaiah 66:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-6.htm">Amos 5:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-13.htm">1 Corinthians 3:13</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-18.htm">Revelation 3:18</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And on his head were many crowns;</span> <span class="accented">and upon his head</span> [<span class="accented">are</span>] <span class="accented">many diadems.</span> <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x1f75;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, <span class="accented">" kingly crowns "</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-3.htm">Revelation 12:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-1.htm">Revelation 13:1</a>), because he now comes as a King to judgment. The plurality of "crowns" points to his character as King of kings (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-14.htm">Revelation 17:14</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-1.htm">Revelation 13:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself;</span> <span class="accented">hath a name</span>... <span class="accented">no, one knoweth.</span> Evidently the "new name" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-12.htm">Revelation 3:12</a>, the significance of which St. John is unable to comprehend (see on Revelation 2:7; 3:12). From the connection with the preceding clause, we naturally infer that this <span class="accented">name</span> was written upon his forehead (cf <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-3.htm">Revelation 7:3</a>); 16:1); but the writer does not explicitly state this.
