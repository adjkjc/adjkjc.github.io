The word "holy" is repeated eight times in the Sinaitic version. The "six wings" are taken to express reverence, for with twain (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-2.htm" title="Above it stood the seraphim: each one had six wings; with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he did fly.">Isaiah 6:2</a>) he covered his face; humility, for with twain he covered his feet; and obedience, for with twain he did fly. Some have understood these living beings to betoken rather the creative power of God than the actual creation. There is much to be said for this; but the analogy of the passage suits better the view here adopted. The twenty-four elders represent, not the regenerating power of God, but the regenerate Church. The new creation in Christ Jesus join in praise with all created things. The doxology in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-11.htm" title="You are worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honor and power: for you have created all things, and for your pleasure they are and were created.">Revelation 4:11</a> favours the interpretation, "Thou hast created all things."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him; and they were full of eyes within.</span> The stop should probably be after wings: <span class="accented">are full of eyes about and within.</span> In <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-2.htm">Isaiah 6:2</a> we have "six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly." These actions appear to indicate reverence, humility, obedience. The eyes denote ceaseless activity. And they rest not day and night, saying. In the Authorized Version "day and night" is attached to "rest not." but probably should be taken with "saying," for, if connected with the negative phrase, "nor" would be more likely to occur than "and." But the point is practically immaterial, since the sense of the passage is the same in both readings. These representatives of <span class="accented">life</span> display the characteristics of life in its fullest energy. They have no part in anything which savours of death - no stillness, rest, or sleep. <span class="cmt_word">Holy, holy, holy.</span> The thrice-repeated "holy" has very generally been held to indicate the Trinity of the Godhead. Such is evidently the intention of the English Church in ordering this passage to be read in the Epistle for Trinity Sunday. This ascription of praise is often, though wrongly, spoken of as the "Trisagion." <span class="cmt_word">Lord God Almighty</span>. "Almighty" is <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;</span>, the "All-Ruler," not <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, the "All-Powerful." The former, as Bishop Pearson says, embraces the latter. <span class="cmt_word">Which was, and is, and is to come.</span> This phrase is no doubt intended to attribute to God the quality of eternal existence. But it may also symbolize three aspects or departments of God's dealings with mankind: the <span class="accented">creation</span>, which has been effected by the Father; the <span class="accented">redemption</span>, which is now occurring by the intercession of the Son; and the final perfect <span class="accented">sanctification</span> by the Holy Ghost. <div class="cred"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/revelation/4-8.htm">Revelation 4:8 Commentaries</a></div><div class="vheading2">Jump to Previous</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-8.htm">Almighty</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-6.htm">Beasts</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-14.htm">Cease</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-6.htm">Creatures</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-4.htm">Direction</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-18.htm">Evermore</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-6.htm">Eyes</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-6.htm">Four</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-6.htm">Full</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-7.htm">Holy</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-13.htm">Night</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-2.htm">Rest</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-14.htm">Ruler</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-17.htm">Six</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-14.htm">Wast</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-5.htm">Wings</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-27.htm">Within</a><div class="vheading2">Jump to Next</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-17.htm">Almighty</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-9.htm">Beasts</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/9-20.htm">Cease</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-9.htm">Creatures</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-24.htm">Direction</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-29.htm">Evermore</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-6.htm">Eyes</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-10.htm">Four</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-8.htm">Full</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-11.htm">Holy</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-15.htm">Night</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-11.htm">Rest</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-10.htm">Ruler</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-18.htm">Six</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-9.htm">Wast</a> <a href="9-9.htm">Wings</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-1.htm">Within</a><div class="vheading2">Links</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/niv/revelation/4-8.htm">Revelation 4:8 NIV</a><br /><a href="https://biblehub.com/nlt/revelation/4-8.htm">Revelation 4:8 NLT</a><br /><a href="https://biblehub.com/esv/revelation/4-8.htm">Revelation 4:8 ESV</a><br /><a href="https://biblehub.com/nasb/revelation/4-8.htm">Revelation 4:8 NASB</a><br /><a href="https://biblehub.com/kjv/revelation/4-8.htm">Revelation 4:8 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://bibleapps.com/revelation/4-8.htm">Revelation 4:8 Bible Apps</a><br /><a href="https://bibliaparalela.com/revelation/4-8.htm">Revelation 4:8 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="https://holybible.com.cn/revelation/4-8.htm">Revelation 4:8 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="https://saintebible.com/revelation/4-8.htm">Revelation 4:8 French Bible</a><br /><a href="https://bibeltext.com/revelation/4-8.htm">Revelation 4:8 German Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Alphabetical: all Almighty and are around cease come covered creatures Day do Each even eyes four full God had having his Holy is living Lord never night not of one say saying six stop the them they to under was who wings with within<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="4-8.htm">NT Prophecy: Revelation 4:8 The four living creatures each one (Rev.
