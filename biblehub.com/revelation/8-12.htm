It is a day of the Lord in which the light is not clear nor dark--not day nor night (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/zechariah/14-6.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, that the light shall not be clear, nor dark:">Zechariah 14:6-7</a>). There will be periods in which the lights which guide men will give forth uncertain glimmers; upon the earth there will be distress of nations, men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth, for the powers of heaven shall be shaken (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/21-25.htm" title="And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and on the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring;">Luke 21:25-26</a>). Such times of darkness and sorrow must be. It is through seasons such as these, when the lights of human wisdom and of spiritual guidance seem alike obscured, that the Church must go forward. The chaos precedes creation, and it is through chaos again that the Church of Christ must pass to the new heaven and new earth. These trumpet-visions, if read by the side of the story of Genesis, seem like the undoing of creation: the vegetation is smitten, the earth and sea are intermingled, the lights of the heavens are darkened, the living things in seas and streams are destroyed; but<p>"Fresher life the world shall draw<p>From their decay."<p>The pulling down must precede the building up; the removing of the degenerate is one step in the way to the regeneration.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third part of the stars</span>. Still the created universe is the direct object of these visitations. The planets were smitten, but we are not told with what instrument. As Alford points out, this may teach us not to lay too great stress upon that part of the visions which describes the means. Our attention is to be fixed upon the effect, the stroke, not upon the mountain or the star by whose means the result is attained. (For the signification of <span class="accented">the third part, vide supra.</span>) In the Bible, frequent use is made of this figure to express trouble and commotion (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-10.htm">Isaiah 13:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-23.htm">Isaiah 24:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-9.htm">Jeremiah 15:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-7.htm">Ezekiel 32:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-9.htm">Amos 8:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-29.htm">Matthew 24:29</a>). The sun, etc., are also looked upon as examples of stability. Thus <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-5.htm">Psalm 72:5</a>, "As long as the sun and moon endure" (see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-17.htm">Psalm 72:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-36.htm">Psalm 89:36</a>). The vision may therefore be suggestive of God's power over things the most permanent and stable, and thus demonstrate to Christians his ability to punish "the ungodly who prosper in the world." Thus <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-7.htm">Job 9:7</a> attributes omnipotence to God, "which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and scaleth up the stars" (see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/136-8.htm">Psalm 136:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-35.htm">Jeremiah 31:35</a>). Thus, then, God can turn even the benign influences of the sun and planets into means for the destruction of man. In the countless evils which have their origin in the excess or defect of the power of the sun, we may see an illustration of the fulfilment of this judgment. We may point out that the very existence of such visitations as are here portrayed preclude the possibility of the fulfilment of the trumpet visions being subsequent in time to those of the seals. <span class="cmt_word">So as the third part of them was darkened, and the day shone not for a third part of it, and the night likewise;</span> <span class="accented">that the third part of them should be darkened, and the day should not shine for the third part of it, and the night in like manner.</span> Probably, total darkness for a third part of the day and night is meant; not a third of the usual amount of light during the whole day and night (as Bengel and others). Renan, as a preterist, sees the fulfilment in the eclipses of A.D. . De Lyra, Wordsworth, and others see in this judgment a symbol of the infidelity, heresies, apostasies, and confusions in the world in the seventh century and at other times.
