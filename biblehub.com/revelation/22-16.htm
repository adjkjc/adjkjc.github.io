The revelation proper being now ended, the epistolary form in which the book opens is now resumed. Either our Lord himself is here the speaker, or the angel speaks in his name (cf. vers. 9, 10, 12, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">To testify unto you these things in the Churches</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>). The Revised Version translates, <span class="accented">for</span> [margin. or <span class="accented">over</span>] <span class="accented">the Churches</span> (cf. the expression in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-33.htm">Matthew 24:33</a>). Probably this preposition is used as expressing the idea of motion towards, especially from above, which is contained in the fact that the message is from heaven to the Churches. Dusterdieck, Hengstenberg, and others would translate, "concerning the Churches." <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3bd;</span>, "in," is found in A and some other manuscripts. Some cursives omit the preposition entirely. This gives another possible reading: "to testify these things unto you, the Churches." <span class="cmt_word">I am the Root and the Offspring of David, and the Bright and Morning Star.</span> Omit the second "and." (On "Root," see on Revelation 5:5; for "Morning Star," cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-28.htm">Revelation 2:28</a>.) At the word "David," the manuscript 1, from which Erasmus compiled the Textus Receptus, ends. In order to supply the remainder, which is deficient, Erasmus retranslated the Vulgate Version into Greek. The Greek, therefore, of the Textus Receptus from this point onwards is the Greek of Erasmus. <div class="cred"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/revelation/22-16.htm">Revelation 22:16 Commentaries</a></div><div class="vheading2">Jump to Previous</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-8.htm">Angel</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-22.htm">Assemblies</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-1.htm">Bright</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-22.htm">Churches</a> <a href="../../bit.ly/2ibqkJb.html">David</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-5.htm">Declare</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-16.htm">Descendant</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-4.htm">Jesus</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-8.htm">Messenger</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-28.htm">Morning</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-28.htm">Morning-Star</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-17.htm">Offspring</a> <a href="../../bit.ly/2ibqkJb.html">Root</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/10-6.htm">Solemnly</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/9-1.htm">Star</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-2.htm">Testify</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-4.htm">Testimony</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/15-5.htm">Witness</a><div class="vheading2">Jump to Next</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/16-7.htm">Angel</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-2.htm">Assemblies</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/44-3.htm">Bright</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-31.htm">Churches</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/4-17.htm">David</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-18.htm">Declare</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-13.htm">Descendant</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-20.htm">Jesus</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/16-7.htm">Messenger</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-5.htm">Morning</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-28.htm">Morning-Star</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-15.htm">Offspring</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-18.htm">Root</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-18.htm">Solemnly</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-17.htm">Star</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-18.htm">Testify</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-34.htm">Testimony</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-20.htm">Witness</a><div class="vheading2">Links</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/niv/revelation/22-16.htm">Revelation 22:16 NIV</a><br /><a href="https://biblehub.com/nlt/revelation/22-16.htm">Revelation 22:16 NLT</a><br /><a href="https://biblehub.com/esv/revelation/22-16.htm">Revelation 22:16 ESV</a><br /><a href="https://biblehub.com/nasb/revelation/22-16.htm">Revelation 22:16 NASB</a><br /><a href="https://biblehub.com/kjv/revelation/22-16.htm">Revelation 22:16 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://bibleapps.com/revelation/22-16.htm">Revelation 22:16 Bible Apps</a><br /><a href="https://bibliaparalela.com/revelation/22-16.htm">Revelation 22:16 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="https://holybible.com.cn/revelation/22-16.htm">Revelation 22:16 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="https://saintebible.com/revelation/22-16.htm">Revelation 22:16 French Bible</a><br /><a href="https://bibeltext.com/revelation/22-16.htm">Revelation 22:16 German Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Alphabetical: am and angel bright churches David descendant for give have I Jesus Morning my of Offspring Root sent Star testify testimony the these things this to you<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="22-16.htm">NT Prophecy: Revelation 22:16 I Jesus have sent my angel (Rev.
