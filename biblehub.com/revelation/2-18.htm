It was a Macedonian colony, founded by Alexander the Great after the overthrow of the Persian empire. The Macedonian colonists appear to have introduced the worship of Apollo, honoured as the Sun-god, under the name of Tyrimnas. It has been thought by some that the description here given of Christ--"the eyes of flame"--was selected in allusion to this worship of the Sun-god, under the form of some dazzlingly ornamented image. Certainly close commercial intercourse connected the daughter colony with its mother city. There seem to have been various mercantile guilds in the colony--bakers, potters, tanners, weavers, and dyers. The dye-trade was, perhaps, the most important. Lydia, the seller of purple, was in all likelihood connected with the guild of dyers; and her appearance in Philippi is an illustration of the trade relations of Macedonia and Thyatira. To her the Christian community at Thyatira may have owed its beginning. "She who had gone forth for a while, to buy and sell, and get gain, when she returned home may have brought home with her richer merchandise than any she had looked to obtain" (Trench). The population was of a mixed character, and included, besides Asiatics, Macedonians, Italians, and Chaldeans. The message which is sent to the Christians dwelling among them is from "th<span class= "ital">e Son of God."</span> This is noteworthy, when we remember how persistently the other term, "<span class= "ital">Son of Man," </span>is used throughout the Book of Revelation, and that here only is the phrase "Son of God" used; but it suits, as does the whole description, the message which breathes the language of sovereignty and righteous sternness. The "eyes of flame" will search the reins and the hearts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-23.htm" title="And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches shall know that I am he which searches the reins and hearts: and I will give to every one of you according to your works.">Revelation 2:23</a>); the "feet of fine brass" will tread down the enemies, and smooth the path before them, who will have power over the nations.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 18-29.</span> - <span class="accented">The epistle to the Church at Thyatira.</span> The circuit now turns southwards. From Ephesus to Smyrna, and from Smyrna to Pergamum, was movement almost due north. Thyatira is on the Lycus, close to the Roman road between Pergamum and Sardis. It was refounded and named Thyatira by Seleucus Nicator, after the conquest of Persia by Alexander. It was strongly Macedonian in population; and it is worth noting that it is in Philippi, a city of Macedonia, that Lydia of Thyatira is found (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-14.htm">Acts 16:14</a>). An inscription in Greek and Latin shows that Vespasian restored the roads thereabouts. Three other inscriptions mention the dyers (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>), for which Thyatira and the neighbourhood ('Iliad,' 4:141) were so famous, to which guild Lydia belonged (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-14.htm">Acts 16:14</a>). There is no allusion to the trade here; and modern authorities differ as to whether it survives or not at the present day. But the statement that "large quantities of scarlet cloth are sent weekly to Smyrna" (Macdonald's 'Life and Writings of St. John,' p. 187) seems to be decisive. Apollo, the sun god, was the chief deity at Thyatira, where he was worshipped under the Macedonian name of Tyrimnas. There is, perhaps, a reference by contrast to him in the epistle, in the opening description of the Son of God, and in "the morning star" to be given to "him that overcometh." A similar allusion to the worship of Dionysus was traced in the epistle to Smyrna. The modern name of the town is <span class="accented">Ak-Hissar</span>, "the white castle," so called from the rocky hill overhanging it, on which a fortress formerly stood. Of the nine thousand inhabitants, about three thousand are Christians, who have the trade of the place in their hands. The ancient Church of St. John the Divine has been turned into a mosque. This fourth and therefore central epistle is the longest of the seven. In some respects it is the most solemn of all. Here only is the majestic title, "the Son of God," introduced. In the introductory vision the expression used is "Son of man" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-13.htm">Revelation 1:13</a>). "The Son of God," frequent in the Gospel and Epistles of St. John, occurs nowhere else in the Apocalypse. It may be suggested by <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a>, "Thou art my Son; this day have I begotten thee;" for <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-9.htm">Psalm 2:9</a> is quoted in ver. 27 (comp. also ver. 26 with <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-8.htm">Psalm 2:8</a>). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - Who hath his eyes like a flame (see notes on Revelation 1:14, 15). <div class="cred"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/revelation/2-18.htm">Revelation 2:18 Commentaries</a></div><div class="vheading2">Jump to Previous</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-12.htm">Angel</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-12.htm">Assembly</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-14.htm">Blazing</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-15.htm">Brass</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-4.htm">Bronze</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-15.htm">Burnished</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-12.htm">Church</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-14.htm">Eyes</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-17.htm">Feet</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-15.htm">Fine</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-15.htm">Fire</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-14.htm">Flame</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-12.htm">Follows</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-12.htm">Messenger</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-12.htm">Minister</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-15.htm">Polished</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-13.htm">Resembling</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-11.htm">Thyateira</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-11.htm">Thyatira</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-11.htm">Thyati'ra</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-12.htm">Words</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-12.htm">Write</a><div class="vheading2">Jump to Next</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-1.htm">Angel</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-1.htm">Assembly</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-5.htm">Blazing</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/9-20.htm">Brass</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/9-20.htm">Bronze</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-45.htm">Burnished</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-1.htm">Church</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-18.htm">Eyes</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-9.htm">Feet</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-12.htm">Fine</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-18.htm">Fire</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/8-10.htm">Flame</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-1.htm">Follows</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-1.htm">Messenger</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-1.htm">Minister</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/13-40.htm">Polished</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-3.htm">Resembling</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-24.htm">Thyateira</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-24.htm">Thyatira</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-24.htm">Thyati'ra</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-1.htm">Words</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-1.htm">Write</a><div class="vheading2">Links</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/niv/revelation/2-18.htm">Revelation 2:18 NIV</a><br /><a href="https://biblehub.com/nlt/revelation/2-18.htm">Revelation 2:18 NLT</a><br /><a href="https://biblehub.com/esv/revelation/2-18.htm">Revelation 2:18 ESV</a><br /><a href="https://biblehub.com/nasb/revelation/2-18.htm">Revelation 2:18 NASB</a><br /><a href="https://biblehub.com/kjv/revelation/2-18.htm">Revelation 2:18 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://bibleapps.com/revelation/2-18.htm">Revelation 2:18 Bible Apps</a><br /><a href="https://bibliaparalela.com/revelation/2-18.htm">Revelation 2:18 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="https://holybible.com.cn/revelation/2-18.htm">Revelation 2:18 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="https://saintebible.com/revelation/2-18.htm">Revelation 2:18 French Bible</a><br /><a href="https://bibeltext.com/revelation/2-18.htm">Revelation 2:18 German Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Alphabetical: a and angel are blazing bronze burnished church eyes feet fire flame God has His in like of says Son the These this Thyatira To who whose words write<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="2-18.htm">NT Prophecy: Revelation 2:18 To the angel of the assembly (Rev.
