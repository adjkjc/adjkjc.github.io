(Comp. the Messianic prophecy of Psalms 2) Those who refused to stoop to the customs around them, and to gain influence by crushing or ignoring their convictions--those who, like their Master, refused to win power by doing homage to wrong (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/4-8.htm" title="Again, the devil takes him up into an exceeding high mountain, and shows him all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them;">Matthew 4:8-10</a>), would share the nobler sway which He now established. Wherever the Church has illegitimately grasped at power, she has lost it. "The wretched power which she had wrenched and stolen from the nations has been turned against her; she has been obliged to crouch to them, and beg their help, and they have justly spurned her. She has chosen to exalt herself like Lucifer, and she has fallen like Lucifer. If she had trusted her Lord, He would have given her the morning star. She would have derived from Him what she claimed independently of Him. She would have dispensed light to the world."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And he that overcometh</span>. The usual promise (vers. 7, 11, 17; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-5.htm">Revelation 3:5, 12, 21</a>) is here closely connected with the charge which immediately precedes. In this and in the remaining three epistles the proclamation, "He that hath an ear," etc., follows instead of preceding the promise. <span class="cmt_word">Keepeth my works</span>. This is a phrase thoroughly characteristic of St. John's style; compare for this use of "keep," <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-3.htm">Revelation 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-3.htm">Revelation 3:3, 8, 10</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-51.htm">John 8:51, 52, 55</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-16.htm">John 9:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-15.htm">John 14:15, 21, 23, 24</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-3.htm">1 John 2:3, 4, 5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-22.htm">1 John 3:22, 24</a>, etc.; and for "works," in the sense of works which Christ does or approves, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/15-3.htm">Revelation 15:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-28.htm">John 6:28, 29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-3.htm">John 7:3, 21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-3.htm">John 11:3, 4</a>, etc. "My works" here are in marked contrast to "her works" in ver. 22. "He that overcometh, and he that keepeth" is a <span class="accented">nominativus pendens</span>; and such constructions are specially frequent in St. John (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-12.htm">Revelation 3:12, 21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-39.htm">John 6:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-38.htm">John 7:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-2.htm">John 15:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-2.htm">John 17:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-24.htm">1 John 2:24, 27</a>). Links of connexion between the Revelation and the Gospel or Epistles of St. John should be carefully noted.
