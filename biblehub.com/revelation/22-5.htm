Twice is it said (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-25.htm" title="And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day: for there shall be no night there.">Revelation 21:25</a>) that all darkness shall cease; the darkness in which the saints and sorrowing walked shall be dispelled, when God gives them light. No artificial light is needed, since He who is Light is their light. Those who were children of light now dwell in the light of God's countenance; and they reign who were made kings and priests to God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-6.htm" title="And has made us kings and priests to God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.">Revelation 1:6</a>). With this utterance the visions of the Apocalypse close. The saints of God have been seen in the bitterness and toilfulness of their struggle and pilgrimage towards the Holy City; but from point to point they have made progress. They have gone from strength to strength, unto the God of gods appeareth every one of them in Zion. The Lord God is their sun and shield. He has given grace; He now gives glory. No good thing has been withheld; light, life, and love are theirs. "O Lord God of Hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in Thee" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/84-11.htm" title="For the LORD God is a sun and shield: the LORD will give grace and glory: no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly.">Psalm 84:11-12</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light;</span> <span class="accented">and there shall be night no more</span>; <span class="accented">and they need no light of lamp, neither light of sun: for the Lord God shall shine upon them.</span> A repetition of <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-23.htm">Revelation 21:23, 25</a> (which see).

Again an assertion of the Divinity of the Son (cf. ver. 3). <span class="cmt_word">And they shall reign forever and ever.</span> This prediction and promise ends the Revelation, as such. It is the reward placed before those who strive, in order to induce them to "overcome" (see on ver. 5 above, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-12.htm">Revelation 3:12</a>). <div class="cred"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/revelation/22-5.htm">Revelation 22:5 Commentaries</a></div><div class="vheading2">Jump to Previous</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-10.htm">Ages</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/18-23.htm">Candle</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-10.htm">Forever</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-39.htm">Illumine</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-24.htm">Kings</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-23.htm">Lamp</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-4.htm">Longer</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-23.htm">Need</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-25.htm">Night</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-6.htm">Reign</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-6.htm">Ruling</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-23.htm">Shine</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-11.htm">Shining</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-23.htm">Sun</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-4.htm">Sunlight</a><div class="vheading2">Jump to Next</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/43-33.htm">Ages</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-6.htm">Candle</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-22.htm">Forever</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-39.htm">Illumine</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-2.htm">Kings</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-17.htm">Lamp</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-12.htm">Longer</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-17.htm">Need</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-5.htm">Night</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-33.htm">Reign</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-2.htm">Ruling</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-37.htm">Shine</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-10.htm">Shining</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-12.htm">Sun</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/5-14.htm">Sunlight</a><div class="vheading2">Links</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/niv/revelation/22-5.htm">Revelation 22:5 NIV</a><br /><a href="https://biblehub.com/nlt/revelation/22-5.htm">Revelation 22:5 NLT</a><br /><a href="https://biblehub.com/esv/revelation/22-5.htm">Revelation 22:5 ESV</a><br /><a href="https://biblehub.com/nasb/revelation/22-5.htm">Revelation 22:5 NASB</a><br /><a href="https://biblehub.com/kjv/revelation/22-5.htm">Revelation 22:5 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://bibleapps.com/revelation/22-5.htm">Revelation 22:5 Bible Apps</a><br /><a href="https://bibliaparalela.com/revelation/22-5.htm">Revelation 22:5 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="https://holybible.com.cn/revelation/22-5.htm">Revelation 22:5 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="https://saintebible.com/revelation/22-5.htm">Revelation 22:5 French Bible</a><br /><a href="https://bibeltext.com/revelation/22-5.htm">Revelation 22:5 German Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Alphabetical: a And any be because ever for forever give God have illumine lamp light longer Lord more need night no nor not of or reign sun the them There They will<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="22-5.htm">NT Prophecy: Revelation 22:5 There will be no night and they (Rev.
