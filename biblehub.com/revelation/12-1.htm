It is the same word which is rendered sign in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/15-1.htm" title="And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvelous, seven angels having the seven last plagues; for in them is filled up the wrath of God.">Revelation 15:1</a>. It is a sign which is seen: not a mere wonder, but something which has a meaning; it is not "a surprise ending with itself," but a signal to arrest attention, and possessing significance; there is "an idea concealed behind it." (Comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-11.htm" title="This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.">John 2:11</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">A woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars.--</span>All the lights of heaven are brought together here for a description which cannot fail to remind us of the picture of the Shulamite in the Canticles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/6-10.htm" title="Who is she that looks forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners?">Song of Solomon 6:10</a>): "Who is she that looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners (or, <span class= "ital">the heavenly host)</span>?" It is the picture of the bride, the Church. The beams of the divine glory clothe her; she has caught--like Moses--the radiance of her Lord, whose countenance was as the sun (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-16.htm" title="And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp two edged sword: and his countenance was as the sun shines in his strength.">Revelation 1:16</a>); the moon is beneath her feet; she rises superior to all change, and lays all lesser lights of knowledge under tribute; she is crowned with a crown of twelve stars: the illustrious members of the Church (twelve being the representative number in Old Testament as well as New Testament times) form her crown of rejoicing in the day of Christ.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And there appeared a great wonder;</span> <span class="accented">and a great sign was seen</span> (Revised Version). This <span class="accented">sign</span> consists of the whole of the appearances, the account of which is contained in this verse and the following one. The vision is thus plainly declared to be figurative (cf. the use of the corresponding verb in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-1.htm">Revelation 1:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In heaven.</span> Though the scene of the vision opens in <span class="accented">heaven</span>, it is immediately afterwards transferred to the earth. It is doubtful whether any particular signification is to be attached to the expression, though Wordsworth notes concerning the Church, "For her origin is from above; hers is the kingdom of heaven." And Bengel, "The woman, the Church, though on earth, is nevertheless, by virtue of her union with Christ, in heaven." <span class="cmt_word">A woman.</span> The <span class="accented">woman</span> is undoubtedly the Church of God; not necessarily limited to the Christian Church, but the whole company of all who acknowledge God, including the heavenly beings in existence before the creation, as well as creation itself. The figure is found both in the Old Testament and in the New. Thus <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-5.htm">Isaiah 54:5, 6</a>, "For thy Maker is thine Husband .... For the Lord hath called thee as a woman forsaken and grieved" (cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-29.htm">John 3:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-2.htm">2 Corinthians 11:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-25.htm">Ephesians 5:25-32</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Clothed with the sun.</span> The whole description is intended to portray the glory and beauty of the Church. Most of the ancient commentators give particular interpretations of the symbols employed. Thus the <span class="accented">sun</span> is believed to represent Christ, the Sun of Righteousness. Primasius quotes <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-27.htm">Galatians 3:27</a>, "For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ." <span class="cmt_word">And the moon under her feet.</span> This is interpreted as showing the permanent nature of the Church; she treads underfoot the moon, the symbol of changing times and seasons. It is thought that a reference is thus intended to the futility of the endeavours made to subvert the Church (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/6-10.htm">Song of Solomon 6:10</a>). Others variously interpret the <span class="accented">moon</span> of <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the Mosaic Law; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the irreligion of the world; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> the Mohammedan power. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But the figure is probably intended simply to enhance the beauty of the vision, and to portray the exceeding glory of the Church. We may also imagine the symbol to denote stability of existence in the midst of change of outward appearance, as the <span class="accented">moon</span> is ever existent and ever reappearing, though obscured for a time. <span class="cmt_word">And upon her head a crown of twelve stars</span>. This image immediately suggests a reference to the twelve apostles of the Christian Church, and the twelve tribes of the Jewish Church. Wordsworth observes, "<span class="accented">Twelve</span> is the <span class="accented">apostolic</span> number, and <span class="accented">stars</span> are emblems of Christian teachers." In like manner the Jews were accustomed to speak of the minor prophets as "the twelve." The <span class="accented">crown</span> is <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x28;</span> the crown of victory - the idea of which is prominent throughout the vision. <div class="cred"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/revelation/12-1.htm">Revelation 12:1 Commentaries</a></div><div class="vheading2">Jump to Previous</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-19.htm">Appeared</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-3.htm">Arrayed</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/3_john/1-11.htm">Child</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-3.htm">Clothed</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-2.htm">Crown</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-11.htm">Feet</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-19.htm">Great</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/10-1.htm">Head</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-19.htm">Heaven</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-13.htm">Marvel</a> <a href="8-12.htm">Moon</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-8.htm">Portent</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/10-1.htm">Robed</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/10-1.htm">Round</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-20.htm">Sign</a> <a href="8-12.htm">Stars</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/10-1.htm">Sun</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-3.htm">Twelve</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-13.htm">Wonder</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-2.htm">Wreath</a><div class="vheading2">Jump to Next</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-3.htm">Appeared</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/15-6.htm">Arrayed</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-2.htm">Child</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/15-6.htm">Clothed</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-14.htm">Crown</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-2.htm">Feet</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-3.htm">Great</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-3.htm">Head</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-3.htm">Heaven</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-3.htm">Marvel</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-23.htm">Moon</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-3.htm">Portent</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/65-6.htm">Robed</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-11.htm">Round</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-3.htm">Sign</a> <a href="12-4.htm">Stars</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-8.htm">Sun</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-12.htm">Twelve</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-3.htm">Wonder</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-14.htm">Wreath</a><div class="vheading2">Links</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/niv/revelation/12-1.htm">Revelation 12:1 NIV</a><br /><a href="https://biblehub.com/nlt/revelation/12-1.htm">Revelation 12:1 NLT</a><br /><a href="https://biblehub.com/esv/revelation/12-1.htm">Revelation 12:1 ESV</a><br /><a href="https://biblehub.com/nasb/revelation/12-1.htm">Revelation 12:1 NASB</a><br /><a href="https://biblehub.com/kjv/revelation/12-1.htm">Revelation 12:1 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://bibleapps.com/revelation/12-1.htm">Revelation 12:1 Bible Apps</a><br /><a href="https://bibliaparalela.com/revelation/12-1.htm">Revelation 12:1 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="https://holybible.com.cn/revelation/12-1.htm">Revelation 12:1 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="https://saintebible.com/revelation/12-1.htm">Revelation 12:1 French Bible</a><br /><a href="https://bibeltext.com/revelation/12-1.htm">Revelation 12:1 German Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Alphabetical: A and appeared clothed crown feet great head heaven her in moon of on sign stars sun the twelve under with woman wondrous<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="12-1.htm">NT Prophecy: Revelation 12:1 A great sign was seen in heaven: (Rev.
