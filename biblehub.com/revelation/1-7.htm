In the "clouds" St. Augustine sees the emblem of the saints of the Church, which is His body, who spread as a vast fertilising cloud over the whole world.<p><span class= "bld">Every eye shall see him, and they also which</span> (<span class= "ital">they were who = </span>"whosoever") <span class= "bld">pierced him.</span>--Here again is a reference to the incident of the piercing of Christ's side (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-34.htm" title="But one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and immediately came there out blood and water.">John 19:34</a>), recorded only by St. John.<p><span class= "bld">Shall wail because of him.</span>--Or, <span class= "ital">shall wail over Him.</span> The prophecy in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-10.htm" title="And I will pour on the house of David, and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplications: and they shall look on me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourns for his only son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn.">Zechariah 12:10</a>, is the suggesting one of this. But the passage in Zechariah describes the mourning of grief over the dead; the passage here is the mourning towards one who was dead, and is alive. He towards whom they now direct their sorrow is the One over whom they should have wailed when He was laid in His tomb.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/revelation/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7, 8.</span> - It is difficult to determine the exact connexion of these verses with one another, and with what precedes and follows. It seems best to make ver. 7 a kind of appendix to the salutation, and ver. 8 a kind of prelude to the whole book. They each give us one of the fundamental thoughts of the Apocalypse; ver. 7, Christ's certain return to judgment; ver. 8, his perfect Divinity. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He cometh</span>. He who loveth us and cleansed us and made us to be a kingdom will assuredly come. While interpreting the verse of the second advent, we need not exclude the coming to "those who pierced him" in the destruction of Jerusalem, and to "the tribes of the earth" in the breakup of the Roman empire. <span class="cmt_word">With the clouds.</span> This probably refers to <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-62.htm">Mark 14:62</a>, "Ye shall see the Son of man ... coming with the clouds of heaven" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13</a>, "Behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven"). Aquinas and other writers make the clouds symbolize the saints, "who rain by preaching, glisten by working miracles, are lifted up by refusing earthly things, fly by lofty contemplation." <span class="cmt_word">And they</span> also; better, <span class="accented">and all they who</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f35;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>) <span class="accented">pierced him.</span> This is strong evidence of common authorship between the Fourth Gospel and the Apocalypse. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> St. John alone mentions the piercing. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-37.htm">John 19:37</a> the writer, in quoting <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-10.htm">Zechariah 12:10</a>, deserts the LXX. and follows the Masoretic Hebrew text. The LXX. softens down "pierced" into "insulted" (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>), "piercing" appearing a violent expression to use respecting men's treatment of Jehovah. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-37.htm">John 19:37</a> the writer, in translating from the Hebrew, uses the uncommon Greek word <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1fb7;&#x3bd;</span>. The reference here is to all those who "crucify the Son of God afresh," not merely to the Jews. In what follows the Revised Version is to be preferred: "and all <span class="accented">the tribes</span> of the earth shall <span class="accented">mourn over</span> him? The wording is similar to <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-30.htm">Matthew 24:30</a> and the LXX. of <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-10.htm">Zechariah 12:10</a>.
