Like Samson (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/13-4.htm" title="Now therefore beware, I pray you, and drink not wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing:">Judges 13:4-5</a>), Samuel (inferentially from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-11.htm" title="And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if you will indeed look on the affliction of your handmaid, and remember me, and not forget your handmaid, but will give to your handmaid a man child, then I will give him to the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come on his head.">1Samuel 1:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-15.htm" title="And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but have poured out my soul before the LORD.">1Samuel 1:15</a>), and the Baptist (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-15.htm" title="For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb.">Luke 1:15</a>), they were life-long Nazarites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/6-1.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,">Numbers 6:1-6</a>). Jonadab's intention was obviously to keep them as a separate people, retaining their nomadic form of life, free from the contamination of cities, or the temptations of acquired property, or the risks of attack which such property brought with it. They are now invited, and it must have seemed to them a strange invitation to come from a prophet's lips, to break that rule, and they answer almost in the tone of a calm but indignant protest. They have been faithful hitherto, and they will continue faithful still. In the words "that your days may be long in the land" we may, perhaps, trace an echo of the fifth commandment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-12.htm" title="Honor your father and your mother: that your days may be long on the land which the LORD your God gives you.">Exodus 20:12</a>), viewed as extending to the relations which connect the members of an order with its head. The rule has descended to the followers of Islam, and the law of abstinence has been extended by Abdul-Wahab to tobacco. Diodoras Siculus (xix. 94) relates that the Nabathaeans adopted the Rechabite rule in its completeness. Possibly they were Rechabites.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/jeremiah/35.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jonadab the son of Rechab our father.</span> Jonadab (the contemporary of King Jehu) is here called the "father" of the Rechabites (comp. vers. 14, 16), in the same sense in which the disciples of the prophets are called the "sons of the prophets;" he was a teacher, if not (in some sense) a prophet. This illustrates the uncompromising zeal of Jonadab in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-23.htm">2 Kings 10:23</a>; the religion of Baal was probably at the opposite pole in the matter of luxury to that of Jehovah as practised by Jonadab. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Not for you the life<br />Of sloth and ease within the city's gates,<br />Where idol feasts are held, and incense smokes<br />To Baalim and Ashtaroth; where man<br />Loses his manhood, and the scoffers sit<br />Perverting judgment, selfish, soft, impure."</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Plumptre.</span>) <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall drink no wine,</span> etc. The Rechabites were, in fact, typical Arabs. The Wahhabee movement, in our own century, may be taken as partly parallel, though, of course, a settled life is not one of the abominations of the neo-orthodox Islam. A still more complete parallel is given by Diodorus Siculus (19:94), who states it to be the law of the Nabataeans, "neither to sow corn, nor to plant any fruit-bearing herb, nor to drink wine, nor to prepare houses," and gives as the motive of this the preservation of their independence. <div class="cred"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jeremiah/35-6.htm">Jeremiah 35:6 Commentaries</a></div><div class="vheading2">Jump to Previous</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-7.htm">Age</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-13.htm">Charged</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-22.htm">Command</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-35.htm">Commanded</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-26.htm">Descendants</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-5.htm">Drink</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-27.htm">Forefather</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-11.htm">Forever</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-35.htm">Jonadab</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-35.htm">Jon'adab</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-14.htm">Recab</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-14.htm">Rechab</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-5.htm">Wine</a><div class="vheading2">Jump to Next</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-33.htm">Age</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-8.htm">Charged</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-16.htm">Command</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-8.htm">Commanded</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-16.htm">Descendants</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-8.htm">Drink</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-10.htm">Forefather</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-19.htm">Forever</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-8.htm">Jonadab</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-10.htm">Jon'adab</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-16.htm">Recab</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-8.htm">Rechab</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-8.htm">Wine</a><div class="vheading2">Links</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/niv/jeremiah/35-6.htm">Jeremiah 35:6 NIV</a><br /><a href="https://biblehub.com/nlt/jeremiah/35-6.htm">Jeremiah 35:6 NLT</a><br /><a href="https://biblehub.com/esv/jeremiah/35-6.htm">Jeremiah 35:6 ESV</a><br /><a href="https://biblehub.com/nasb/jeremiah/35-6.htm">Jeremiah 35:6 NASB</a><br /><a href="https://biblehub.com/kjv/jeremiah/35-6.htm">Jeremiah 35:6 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://bibleapps.com/jeremiah/35-6.htm">Jeremiah 35:6 Bible Apps</a><br /><a href="https://bibliaparalela.com/jeremiah/35-6.htm">Jeremiah 35:6 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="https://holybible.com.cn/jeremiah/35-6.htm">Jeremiah 35:6 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="https://saintebible.com/jeremiah/35-6.htm">Jeremiah 35:6 French Bible</a><br /><a href="https://bibeltext.com/jeremiah/35-6.htm">Jeremiah 35:6 German Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Alphabetical: because But command commanded descendants do drink ever father for forefather forever gave Jonadab must Neither nor not of or our Recab Rechab replied said saying shall son sons the they this us We will wine you your<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="35-6.htm">OT Prophets: Jeremiah 35:6 But they said We will drink no (Jer.)
