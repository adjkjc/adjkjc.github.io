In the answer to the question of Thomas in John 14, He declares, "I am the way, the truth, and the life" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-6.htm" title="This they said, tempting him, that they might have to accuse him. But Jesus stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground, as though he heard them not.">John 8:6</a>). It is this thought that is present in the connection between continuance in His word and knowledge of the truth here. These Jews professed to know the truth, and to be the official expounders of it. They had yet to learn that truth was not only a system, but also a power; not only something to be written or spoken, but also something to be felt and lived. If they abide in His word they will indeed be His disciples; living the life of truth, they will gain perception of truth. "Being true," they will "in love grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-15.htm" title="But speaking the truth in love, may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Christ:">Ephesians 4:15</a>).<p><span class= "bld">And the truth shall make you free.</span>--Here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-17.htm" title="Sanctify them through your truth: your word is truth.">John 17:17</a>, truth and holiness are spoken of as correlative. The light of truth dispels the darkness in which lies the stronghold of evil. Sin is the bondage of the powers of the soul, and this bondage is willed because the soul does not see its fearful evil. When it perceives the truth, there comes to it a power which rouses it from its stupor, and strengthens it to break the fetters by which it has been bound. Freedom from the Roman rule was one of the national hopes bound up with Messiah's Advent. There is indeed a freedom from a more crushing foe than the legions of Rome. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/5-9.htm" title="And he asked him, What is your name? And he answered, saying, My name is Legion: for we are many.">Mark 5:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-30.htm" title="And Jesus asked him, saying, What is your name?
