No word which expresses becoming can be used of His existence. He is the I AM, present equally in the human "was," and "is," and "is to come."<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 58.</span> - The reply of Jesus to this taunt is one of the most surprising and baffling kind on any hypothesis of our Lord's consciousness being limited as that of all other of the sons of men. He gives the solemn emphasis of the <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> once more - <span class="cmt_word">Verily, verily, I say unto you, Before Abraham was born</span> (came into being), <span class="cmt_word">I am.</span> Abraham came into existence by birth (the Vulgate translates, <span class="accented">Antequam fierat Abraham Ego sum</span>): <span class="accented">I am.</span> Numerous attempts have been made to explain this climacteric utterance on some humanistic theory. The contrast is very remarkable between <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;</span>. Jesus Christ declared his own timeless existence to have been in his consciousness before Abraham came into being at all. The "I am" reminds us repeatedly, when used by Jesus, of the "I AM THAT I AM" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-14.htm">Exodus 3:14</a>, and the "thou art" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90.htm">Psalm 90</a>. (89:2, LXX.); Psalms 102:28. His human consciousness gave utterance to the awful depths of the eternal Ego. Now, some critics have limited it in its meaning to "I existed in the counsel of God." But there are three objections to this interpretation: one is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that the present tense, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;</span>, and not the past, <span class="greek">&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;</span>, was used by our Lord; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> on this interpretation Abraham must have also equally pre-existed in the counsel of God; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> such a statement would throw no light on the previous discourse. The Racovian Confession of Faith, based on the view of Socinus, explains, "Before Abram becomes Abraham, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the father of many nations, I am it, the Messiah, the Light of the world." Not until my Messianic claims are acknowledged, and the many nations become children of Abraham, does Abraham really become Abraham, does his name derive its full meaning. This would be rabbinical trifling (J.P. Smith, 'Script. Test. to Messiah,' vol. 2). Beyschlag thinks that our Lord realized in his Person not a conscious pre-existence before Abraham, or before all worlds, but an impersonal principle, the image of God, which could only "be" in the eternal mind of God. There is a sense in which every man may realize such pre-existence as this, not merely "the Son of God," nor the new man in Christ, but every man whatsoever; but such a statement is entirely out of harmony with the whole passage that precedes. If the Jews had understood it in this sense, they would not have taken up stores to stone him, but, after their wont, would have said, "So also were we." "Ideas do not see one another." The first <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3bc;&#x1f77;</span> (ver. 12) brought out their angry unbelief, but this excites their murderous assault. We have to observe that this remarkable expression does not stand alone. St. John had reasons for saying "that the Word was with God, and was God. and was made flesh" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-1.htm">John 1:1, 3, 14</a>). If Jesus, in his Divine consciousness, had never elsewhere spoken of having had a <span class="accented">being</span> before his <span class="accented">manifestation</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-46.htm">John 6:46, 62</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-5.htm">John 17:5</a>), of having taken part with the Father from the beginning (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-17.htm">John 5:17</a>), of being "one with the Father" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-30.htm">John 10:30, 33</a>), of being greater than the temple or the sabbath, as being the Object of the eternal love in coming down from heaven, in laying down his life that he might take it again (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-17.htm">John 10:17, 18</a>); and if the language of the apostles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1, 2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-17.htm">Colossians 1:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-18.htm">Revelation 1:18</a>) had not entirely prepared our mind for the data on which such conclusions rested, a generation before this Gospel was reduced to form, we might join the effort to resist such a claim as that of eternal pre-existence. But the whole tenor of the Gospel and the entire New Testament teaching are seen, more and more, to turn upon this fundamental position - that in Christ dwells all the fulness of the Godhead, that he had life in himself, and eternity, and that the manhood has not only been lifted to the highest place in human remembrance, but to the midst of the throne. <div class="cred"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/john/8-58.htm">John 8:58 Commentaries</a></div><div class="vheading2">Jump to Previous</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-57.htm">Abraham</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-39.htm">Abraham's</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-41.htm">Born</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-15.htm">Existence</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-54.htm">Jesus</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-51.htm">Solemn</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-51.htm">Truth</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-51.htm">Verily</a><div class="vheading2">Jump to Next</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-13.htm">Abraham</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-6.htm">Abraham's</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-2.htm">Born</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-17.htm">Existence</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-59.htm">Jesus</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-1.htm">Solemn</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-1.htm">Truth</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-1.htm">Verily</a><div class="vheading2">Links</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/niv/john/8-58.htm">John 8:58 NIV</a><br /><a href="https://biblehub.com/nlt/john/8-58.htm">John 8:58 NLT</a><br /><a href="https://biblehub.com/esv/john/8-58.htm">John 8:58 ESV</a><br /><a href="https://biblehub.com/nasb/john/8-58.htm">John 8:58 NASB</a><br /><a href="https://biblehub.com/kjv/john/8-58.htm">John 8:58 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://bibleapps.com/john/8-58.htm">John 8:58 Bible Apps</a><br /><a href="https://bibliaparalela.com/john/8-58.htm">John 8:58 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="https://holybible.com.cn/john/8-58.htm">John 8:58 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="https://saintebible.com/john/8-58.htm">John 8:58 French Bible</a><br /><a href="https://bibeltext.com/john/8-58.htm">John 8:58 German Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Alphabetical: Abraham am answered before born I Jesus said say tell the them to Truly truth was you<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="8-58.htm">NT Gospels: John 8:58 Jesus said to them Most certainly (Jhn Jo Jn)  Christian Bible Study Resources, Dictionary, Concordance and Search Tools</a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-57.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="John 8:57"><img src="https://biblehub.com/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="John 8:57" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-59.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="John 8:59"><img src="https://biblehub.com/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="John 8:59" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="8-58.htm#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="https://biblehub.com/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="8-58.htm#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="https://biblehub.com/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div>
