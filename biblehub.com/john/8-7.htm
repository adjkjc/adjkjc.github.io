It seems to them that He cannot avoid the snare in which they have placed Him, and that He is seeking the only escape in silence. But there is an answer of which they think not, and this He stands up to give.<p><span class= "bld">He that is without sin among you.</span>--The word rendered "without sin" is frequent in the classical writers, but is found in this place only in the New Testament. It takes here a special meaning from the context, and is to be understood of the class of sins of which her sin was an instance. (Comp. the word "sinner" as used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-37.htm" title="And, behold, a woman in the city, which was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster box of ointment,">Luke 7:37</a>.) Of the immorality among the Jewish rulers, which gives force to these words, evidence is not wanting. Still the wider meaning is probably not excluded. They who ask this question about the Seventh Commandment were themselves breaking the Sixth and the Ninth. It is to be noted, in the application of this answer, that our Lord does not lay down sinlessness as the necessary condition of fitness for taking part in the punishment of guilt. This would be to nullify law, for there could be then no human executive power. He is not speaking in a case brought before the appointed tribunal, but in a case where men assume to themselves the position of judges of another's guilt. In the judge, while he wears the robe of justice, the individual man ceases to exist, and he becomes the representative of God; but these can now speak only as men, and condemn her only by the contrast of a higher purity. (Comp. Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-34.htm" title="Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, You are gods?">John 10:34</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.</span>)<p><span class= "bld">Let him first cast a stone at her.</span>--The Received text and some MSS. (not including the Cambridge MS.) read "the stone," the stone referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-5.htm" title="Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what say you?">John 8:5</a>. "Let him first" means "let him first of you"; not "let him cast the first stone." This was the duty of the witnesses. (See marginal reference.) We must not take the words to express permission only; it is an imperative, expressing command.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7, 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">But when they continued asking him; he lifted up</span> <span class="cmt_word">himself,</span> <span class="cmt_word">and said unto them, He that is without sin, let him first</span> c<span class="cmt_word">ast a stone at her. And again he stooped down, and with his finger</span> <span class="cmt_word">was writing on the ground.</span> The imperfect tense of <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, twice repeated, seems more in harmony with the symbolic meaning of the act than with the record on his part of any special sentence of his supreme wisdom. Christ refused to act the part of the civil magistrate, or to countenance stormy outbreak of murderous passion against this flagrant sinner, to save himself from their bitter malice. He rose, when the appearance of indifference could not be maintained, and at once arrested the outbreak of their unscrupulous fury without presuming to repudiate the letter of the Law. He lifted the discussion from the judicial to the moral sphere. He does not mean that none but the sinless can condemn, or <span class="accented">pronounce verdict</span> upon the guilty; but he calls for special freedom from similar offence on the part of any man who should wish or dare to display his own purity by <span class="accented">taking part in the execution.</span> The narrative would not suggest that every one of these accusers had been in his time guilty of like offence, but <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> must at least mean that he was free from the desires which might lead to the commission of such sin, and Christ calls for inward saintliness and freedom from all irregular propension. He calls for personal chastity as the only possible moral condition for precipitately <span class="accented">executing</span> this ancient and severe law. The question before the crowd (asked so craftily) was, not whether Moses' Law was to stand or not, but whether these particular men, with their foul hearts and spurious zeal, were or were not at that particular moment to encounter the displeasure of Roman power by dashing the stones at the head of this poor trembling creature of sin and shame; whether they were morally competent to condemn to immediate death, and carry the verdict into execution. Before this tremendous summons from the Holy One, conscience could sleep no longer. The hypocrisy of the entire manoeuvre stared them in the face. <div class="cred"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/john/8-7.htm">John 8:7 Commentaries</a></div><div class="vheading2">Jump to Previous</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-6.htm">Bent</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-37.htm">Cast</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-12.htm">Continued</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-51.htm">First</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-6.htm">Head</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-2.htm">However</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-9.htm">Kept</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-5.htm">Lifted</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-40.htm">Persisted</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-6.htm">Question</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-33.htm">Questioning</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-9.htm">Questions</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-18.htm">Raised</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-14.htm">Sin</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-5.htm">Stone</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-37.htm">Stood</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/13-13.htm">Straightened</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-37.htm">Throw</a><div class="vheading2">Jump to Next</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-8.htm">Bent</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-59.htm">Cast</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-23.htm">Continued</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-9.htm">First</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-8.htm">Head</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-26.htm">However</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-9.htm">Kept</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-10.htm">Lifted</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-18.htm">Persisted</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-2.htm">Question</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-15.htm">Questioning</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-15.htm">Questions</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-10.htm">Raised</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-11.htm">Sin</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-59.htm">Stone</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-56.htm">Stood</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-10.htm">Straightened</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-59.htm">Throw</a><div class="vheading2">Links</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/niv/john/8-7.htm">John 8:7 NIV</a><br /><a href="https://biblehub.com/nlt/john/8-7.htm">John 8:7 NLT</a><br /><a href="https://biblehub.com/esv/john/8-7.htm">John 8:7 ESV</a><br /><a href="https://biblehub.com/nasb/john/8-7.htm">John 8:7 NASB</a><br /><a href="https://biblehub.com/kjv/john/8-7.htm">John 8:7 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://bibleapps.com/john/8-7.htm">John 8:7 Bible Apps</a><br /><a href="https://bibliaparalela.com/john/8-7.htm">John 8:7 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="https://holybible.com.cn/john/8-7.htm">John 8:7 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="https://saintebible.com/john/8-7.htm">John 8:7 French Bible</a><br /><a href="https://bibeltext.com/john/8-7.htm">John 8:7 German Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Alphabetical: a among and any asking at be But first he her him If in is kept let of on one persisted questioning said sin stone straightened the them they throw to up When who without you<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="8-7.htm">NT Gospels: John 8:7 But when they continued asking him he (Jhn Jo Jn)  Christian Bible Study Resources, Dictionary, Concordance and Search Tools</a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-6.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="John 8:6"><img src="https://biblehub.com/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="John 8:6" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-8.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="John 8:8"><img src="https://biblehub.com/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="John 8:8" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="8-7.htm#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="https://biblehub.com/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="8-7.htm#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="https://biblehub.com/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div>
