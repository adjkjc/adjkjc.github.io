The thought is parallel to that of the "strait gate" and "narrow way," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/7-13.htm" title="Enter you in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leads to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat:">Matthew 7:13-14</a>, and with St. Paul's thought in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-2.htm" title="By whom also we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God.">Romans 5:2</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-18.htm" title="For through him we both have access by one Spirit to the Father.">Ephesians 2:18</a>. No one can really enter the fold and become a shepherd of the flock who does not seek to do so through the character and life and death of Christ--<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> to devote himself in entire self-sacrifice to the sheep whom he seeks to lead; to live in unfailing prayer to and communion with God, whose the sheep are; to find for himself as for them "the access through Christ Jesus by one Spirit unto the Father." We may not narrow the door to the fold, nor yet may we widen it. He is the Door. No shepherd may enter unless through Him.<p><span class= "bld">He shall be saved.</span>--The words refer primarily to the dangers without the fold from which he shall be delivered. (See the striking parallel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-15.htm" title="If any man's work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.">1Corinthians 3:15</a>, and Note there.) But in the wider thought they include the salvation from sin which is in this life to be realised, and is a necessary qualification for the pastor's work.<p><span class= "bld">And shall go in and out, and find pasture.</span>--The fold will ever be open to him who enters by the Door. He will have perfect freedom to enter, whenever storm or danger or night approaches. He will lead out and find pasture for his flock. In the devotion of his service, and in communion with God, he will daily have an increasing knowledge of truths new and old, and the truths which he learns he will give as food for the souls of men.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/john/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I am the Door: by me</span> - by living relation to me - <span class="cmt_word">if any man</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. either shepherd or sheep, for in this part of the interpretation they are not distinguished, and they alike need "salvation" and "pasture." <span class="cmt_word">By me if any man enter, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture.</span> "Salvation" here spoken of refers primarily to deliverance from dangers, protection from the ravenous wolves without the fold, and from false shepherds within. "Go in and out" is a phrase frequently used "to denote the free use of an abode by one who is at home in the house" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-6.htm">Deuteronomy 28:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-2.htm">Deuteronomy 31:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-21.htm">Acts 1:21</a>). The believer who enters into fellowship with God, and is "saved," does not "go in and out" of that state, but can as a child share by turns the Divine repose of the home, and the high privilege of his sonship in the world. "He claims his share in the inheritance of the world, secure of his home" (Westcott). <div class="cred"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/john/10-9.htm">John 10:9 Commentaries</a></div><div class="vheading2">Jump to Previous</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-7.htm">Door</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-1.htm">Enter</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-2.htm">Enters</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-21.htm">Find</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-58.htm">Food</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-7.htm">Gate</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-4.htm">Goes</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-4.htm">Pasture</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-18.htm">Safety</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-34.htm">Salvation</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-34.htm">Saved</a><div class="vheading2">Jump to Next</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-16.htm">Door</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-28.htm">Enter</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-24.htm">Enters</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-38.htm">Find</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-5.htm">Food</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-2.htm">Gate</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-12.htm">Goes</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-17.htm">Pasture</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-23.htm">Safety</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-47.htm">Salvation</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-12.htm">Saved</a><div class="vheading2">Links</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/niv/john/10-9.htm">John 10:9 NIV</a><br /><a href="https://biblehub.com/nlt/john/10-9.htm">John 10:9 NLT</a><br /><a href="https://biblehub.com/esv/john/10-9.htm">John 10:9 ESV</a><br /><a href="https://biblehub.com/nasb/john/10-9.htm">John 10:9 NASB</a><br /><a href="https://biblehub.com/kjv/john/10-9.htm">John 10:9 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://bibleapps.com/john/10-9.htm">John 10:9 Bible Apps</a><br /><a href="https://bibliaparalela.com/john/10-9.htm">John 10:9 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="https://holybible.com.cn/john/10-9.htm">John 10:9 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="https://saintebible.com/john/10-9.htm">John 10:9 French Bible</a><br /><a href="https://bibeltext.com/john/10-9.htm">John 10:9 German Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Alphabetical: am and anyone be come door enters find gate go He I if in me out pasture saved the through whoever will<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="10-9.htm">NT Gospels: John 10:9 I am the door (Jhn Jo Jn)  Christian Bible Study Resources, Dictionary, Concordance and Search Tools</a></div></div></td></tr></table></div><div id="left"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-8.htm" onmouseover='lft.src="/leftgif.png"' onmouseout='lft.src="/left.png"' title="John 10:8"><img src="https://biblehub.com/left.png" name="lft" border="0" alt="John 10:8" /></a></div><div id="right"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-10.htm" onmouseover='rght.src="/rightgif.png"' onmouseout='rght.src="/right.png"' title="John 10:10"><img src="https://biblehub.com/right.png" name="rght" border="0" alt="John 10:10" /></a></div><div id="botleft"><a href="10-9.htm#" onmouseover='botleft.src="/botleftgif.png"' onmouseout='botleft.src="/botleft.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="https://biblehub.com/botleft.png" name="botleft" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div><div id="botright"><a href="10-9.htm#" onmouseover='botright.src="/botrightgif.png"' onmouseout='botright.src="/botright.png"' title="Top of Page"><img src="https://biblehub.com/botright.png" name="botright" border="0" alt="Top of Page" /></a></div>
