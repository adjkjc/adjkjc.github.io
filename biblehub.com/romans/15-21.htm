The hindrance had been, mainly at least, as is evident from <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x1f7c;</span> (ver. 22), the obligation he was under of completing his ministry in the first place in other quarters (see on Romans 1:13). <span class="cmt_word">But now having no longer place in these regions</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span>, according to the context, there being no additional sphere for my activity there. He had now planted the gospel in all the principal centres, leaving disciples and converts, and probably an ordained ministry, to carry on the work and extend it in the regions round. In this his proper apostolic work consisted; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-14.htm">1 Corinthians 1:14-17</a><span class="cmt_word">), and having a great desire these many years to come unto you; whensoever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you: for I hope to see you on my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first I be somewhat filled with your company</span>. The sense of this verse is no way affected by the omission of "I will come unto you," which authorities are against retaining. If "for," after this omission, be retained, the sentence is incomplete, as St. Paul's sometimes are. The omission of "for" (for which there is some little authority) leaves the sentence improved. The apostle's selection of Spain as his next intended sphere of labour might be due to the notoriety of that Roman province, and the facility of communication with it by sea. His omission of Italy, except for a passing visit, is accounted for by his principle, already enunciated, of not building on other men's foundation, there being already a flourishing Church at any rate at Rome. He hoped, as appears from this verse, that some of the members of it might join him in his mission to Spain. For the word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> would imply their going all the way in the case of a sea-voyage. For the use of the word, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-3.htm">Acts 15:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-38.htm">Acts 20:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-5.htm">Acts 21:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-6.htm">1 Corinthians 16:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-16.htm">2 Corinthians 1:16</a>. Observe the characteristic courtesy of the concluding clause, which is literally, "should I be first <span class="accented">in part"</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> not as much as I should wish, but to such extent as my short stay with you will allow) "filled with you," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> enjoy you. <div class="cred"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/romans/15-21.htm">Romans 15:21 Commentaries</a></div><div class="vheading2">Jump to Previous</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-8.htm">Ears</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-18.htm">Heard</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-25.htm">Hitherto</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-19.htm">Holy</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-20.htm">News</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-13.htm">Rather</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-17.htm">Report</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-26.htm">Scripture</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-19.htm">Tidings</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-25.htm">Understand</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-11.htm">Writings</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-15.htm">Written</a><div class="vheading2">Jump to Next</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-9.htm">Ears</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-19.htm">Heard</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-7.htm">Hitherto</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-16.htm">Holy</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-29.htm">News</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-10.htm">Rather</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-25.htm">Report</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-31.htm">Scripture</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-17.htm">Tidings</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-12.htm">Understand</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-26.htm">Writings</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-22.htm">Written</a><div class="vheading2">Links</div><a href="https://biblehub.com/niv/romans/15-21.htm">Romans 15:21 NIV</a><br /><a href="https://biblehub.com/nlt/romans/15-21.htm">Romans 15:21 NLT</a><br /><a href="https://biblehub.com/esv/romans/15-21.htm">Romans 15:21 ESV</a><br /><a href="https://biblehub.com/nasb/romans/15-21.htm">Romans 15:21 NASB</a><br /><a href="https://biblehub.com/kjv/romans/15-21.htm">Romans 15:21 KJV</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://bibleapps.com/romans/15-21.htm">Romans 15:21 Bible Apps</a><br /><a href="https://bibliaparalela.com/romans/15-21.htm">Romans 15:21 Biblia Paralela</a><br /><a href="https://holybible.com.cn/romans/15-21.htm">Romans 15:21 Chinese Bible</a><br /><a href="https://saintebible.com/romans/15-21.htm">Romans 15:21 French Bible</a><br /><a href="https://bibeltext.com/romans/15-21.htm">Romans 15:21 German Bible</a><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Alphabetical: about and as but had have heard him is it news no not of Rather see shall They Those told understand were who will written<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="15-21.htm">NT Letters: Romans 15:21 But as it is written They will (Rom.
