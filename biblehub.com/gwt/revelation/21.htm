<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-2.htm"><b>2</b></a></span>Then I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, dressed like a bride ready for her husband. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-3.htm"><b>3</b></a></span>I heard a loud voice from the throne say, "God lives with humans! God will make his home with them, and they will be his people. God himself will be with them and be their God. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-4.htm"><b>4</b></a></span>He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There won't be any more death. There won't be any grief, crying, or pain, because the first things have disappeared."</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-5.htm"><b>5</b></a></span>The one sitting on the throne said, "I am making everything new." He said, "Write this: 'These words are faithful and true.'" 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-6.htm"><b>6</b></a></span>He said to me, "It has happened! I am the A and the Z, the beginning and the end. I will give a drink from the fountain filled with the water of life to anyone who is thirsty. It won't cost anything.  
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-7.htm"><b>7</b></a></span>Everyone who wins the victory will inherit these things. I will be their God, and they will be my children. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-8.htm"><b>8</b></a></span>But cowardly, unfaithful, and detestable people, murderers, sexual sinners, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars will find themselves in the fiery lake of burning sulfur. This is the second death."</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-9.htm"><b>9</b></a></span>One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the last seven plagues came to me and said, "Come! I will show you the bride, the wife of the lamb."</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-10.htm"><b>10</b></a></span>He carried me by his power away to a large, high mountain. He showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-11.htm"><b>11</b></a></span>It had the glory of God. Its light was like a valuable gem, like gray quartz, as clear as crystal. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-12.htm"><b>12</b></a></span>It had a large, high wall with 12 gates. Twelve angels were at the gates. The names of the 12 tribes of Israel were written on the gates. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-13.htm"><b>13</b></a></span>There were three gates on the east, three gates on the north, three gates on the south, and three gates on the west. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-14.htm"><b>14</b></a></span>The wall of the city had 12 foundations. The 12 names of the 12 apostles of the lamb were written on them.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-15.htm"><b>15</b></a></span>The angel who was talking to me had a gold measuring stick to measure the city, its gates, and its wall. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-16.htm"><b>16</b></a></span>The city was square. It was as wide as it was long. He measured the city with the stick. It was 12,000 stadia long. Its length, width, and height were the same.  
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-17.htm"><b>17</b></a></span>He measured its wall. According to human measurement, which the angel was using, it was 144 cubits.  
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-18.htm"><b>18</b></a></span>Its wall was made of gray quartz. The city was made of pure gold, as clear as glass. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-19.htm"><b>19</b></a></span>The foundations of the city wall were beautifully decorated with all kinds of gems: The first foundation was gray quartz, the second sapphire, the third agate, the fourth emerald, 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-20.htm"><b>20</b></a></span>the fifth onyx, the sixth red quartz, the seventh yellow quartz, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth green quartz, the eleventh jacinth, and the twelfth amethyst. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-21.htm"><b>21</b></a></span>The 12 gates were 12 pearls. Each gate was made of one pearl. The street of the city was made of pure gold, as clear as glass.</p>
<p class="reg"><span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-22.htm"><b>22</b></a></span>I did not see any temple in it, because the Lord God Almighty and the lamb are its temple. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-23.htm"><b>23</b></a></span>The city doesn't need any sun or moon to give it light because the glory of God gave it light. The lamb was its lamp. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-24.htm"><b>24</b></a></span>The nations will walk in its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-25.htm"><b>25</b></a></span>Its gates will be open all day. They will never close because there won't be any night there. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-26.htm"><b>26</b></a></span>They will bring the glory and wealth of the nations into the holy city. 
<span class="reftext"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-27.htm"><b>27</b></a></span>Nothing unclean, no one who does anything detestable, and no liars will ever enter it. Only those whose names are written in the lamb's Book of Life will enter it. </p></div></div><div id="botbox"><div class="padbot"><div align="center">GOD'S WORD&reg; is a copyrighted work of <a href="https://www.godsword.org/" target="_top">God's Word to the Nations</a>.
