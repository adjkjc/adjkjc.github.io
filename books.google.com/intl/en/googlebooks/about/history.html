        Google Books History
      </h1>

<p>In the beginning, there was Google Books.</p>

<p>Well, not exactly. But one can certainly argue that the project is as old as
Google itself. In 1996, Google co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page were
graduate computer science students working on a research project supported by
the Stanford Digital Library Technologies Project. Their goal was to make
digital libraries work, and their big idea was as follows: in a future world in
which vast collections of books are digitized, people would use a “web crawler”
to index the books’ content and analyze the connections between them,
determining any given book’s relevance and usefulness by tracking the number
and quality of citations from other books.</p>

<p>The crawler they wound up building was called BackRub, and it was this
modern twist on traditional citation analysis that inspired Google’s PageRank
algorithms – the core search technology that makes Google, well, Google.</p>

<p>Even then, Larry and Sergey envisioned people everywhere being able to
search through all of the world’s books to find the ones they’re looking for.
What they couldn’t have imagined was that one day they would launch a project
to help make it happen.</p>

<p>Fast forward to today:</p>

<p>After more than a decade of evolution, innovation and strong partnerships,
Google Books has helped to make more than 40 million books discoverable, in
more than 400 languages.</p>

<p>And we're not done -- not until all of the books in the world can be found
by everyone, everywhere, at any time they need them.</p>

<p>It's the mission that Larry and Sergey set out with as they built Google,
and one that Google Books would like to continue into the future -- to make the
world's information as universally accessible and useful as possible, all the
while respecting publishers, copyright and the role of libraries across the
globe.</p>
