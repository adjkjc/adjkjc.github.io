          <strong>Question:</strong> Can I download books for free using Google
          Books?
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Answer:</strong> Google Books helps you search within and
          discover books. When you find a book that's still under copyright,
          you'll typically see only a small portion of the book at a
          time – either the Snippet View or the Sample Pages View – plus links
          to places where you can buy or borrow it. Some publishers have set their
          in-copyright books to Full Book View. If you find a book that's out
          of copyright, we're also able to display the Full Book View. (You can
          read more about public domain books in Google Books
          <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2005/11/preserving-public-domain-books.html">here</a>.)

          <strong>Question:</strong> Does Google Books give authors and
          publishers a choice whether or not their books appear on the
          platform?
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Answer:</strong> Any publisher or other copyright holder can
          easily exclude their titles from Google Books at any time, for any
          reason. We've posted the details on how to do that here and have a
          support team standing by to help anyone who has trouble doing it on
          their own.
        </p>

        <p>
          It's worth bearing in mind, however, that under no circumstances will
          anyone ever see a full page of an in-copyright book through Google
          Books without the copyright holder's permission; when a book is under
          copyright, we show only snippets of text surrounding the search term
          unless the copyright holder has given us explicit permission to show
          more.

          <strong>Question:</strong> Do booksellers like Amazon pay to include
          links on Google Books?
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Answer:</strong> We provide links to booksellers on Google
          Books pages because we want to make it easier for users to buy books
          and for publishers to sell them. Booksellers don't pay to have their
          links included in Google Books, and Google doesn't receive any money
          if you buy a book from one of these retailers.

          <strong>Question:</strong> Why do some in-copyright books have full
          pages visible?
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Answer:</strong> Whenever you can see more than a few
          snippets of an in-copyright book in Google Books, it's because the
          author or publisher has joined our Partner Program and granted us
          permission to show you the Sample Pages View, which helps you learn
          enough about a book to know whether you want to buy it. This is
          something we do with a publisher's explicit permission.

          <strong>Question:</strong> If a book is still under copyright, is
          scanning it actually legal?
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Answer:</strong> This is probably the most common
          misconception about Google Books, and about copyright law in general.
          The "fair use" provisions of U.S. copyright law
          (<a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode17/usc_sec_17_00000107----000-.html">USC 17 107</a>)
          describe the conditions under which someone may copy a work without
          the copyright holder's permission, like recording a TV show to watch
          later or quoting from an article in a blog post. Fair use is designed
          to safeguard copying that doesn't harm people's incentive or ability
          to produce and sell creative work, including books.
        </p>
        <p>
          We've carefully designed Google Books to make sure our use of books is
          fair and fully consistent with the law. The courts agreed with us,
          determining that Google Books “augments public knowledge by making
          available information about Plaintiffs' books without providing the
          public with a substantial substitute” for buying and reading the
          books,” which makes it a
          <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2220742578695593916">non-infringing fair use</a>.
          Copyright law is aimed at protecting and enhancing the value of
          creative works in order to encourage more of them–in this case, to
          ensure that authors write and publishers publish. We believe that by
          creating new opportunities for readers to find and buy books, we can
          help authors and publishers sell more of them. You can read more
          about fair use

          <strong>Question:</strong> I hold the copyright for a book that I
          found on Google Books. I'd like to make it available to everyone. Is
          that possible?
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, please see the "How to claim books that
          were scanned for the Library Project" section of
          <a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/9689820">this support article</a>.
