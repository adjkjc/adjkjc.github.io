The rule * of truth which we hold, is, that there is one God Almighty, who made all things by His Word, and fashioned and formed, out of that which had no existence, all things which exist.

And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had driven them mad by his sorceries.&#8221; 7 This Simon, then &#8212; who feigned faith, supposing that the apostles themselves performed their cures by the art of magic, and not by the power of God; and with respect to their filling with the Holy Ghost, through the imposition of hands, those that believed in God through Him who was preached by them, namely, Christ Jesus &#8212; suspecting that even this was done through a kind of greater knowledge of magic, and offering money to the apostles, thought he, too, might receive this power of bestowing the Holy Spirit on whomsoever he would, &#8211; was addressed in these words by Peter: &#8220;Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God can be purchased with money : thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter, for thy heart is not right in the sight of God; for I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity.&#8221; &#8220; He, then, not putting faith in God a whit the more, set himself eagerly to contend against the apostles, in order that he himself might seem to be a wonderful being, and applied himself with still greater zeal to the study of the whole magic art, that he might the better bewilder and overpower multitudes of men. Such was his procedure in the reign of Claudius Caesar, by whom also he is said to have been honoured with a statue, on account of his</p>

Moreover, the prophets uttered their predictions under the inspiration of those angels who formed the world; for which reason those who place their trust in him and Helena no longer regarded them, but, as being free, live as they please; for men are saved through his grace, and not on account of their own righteous actions. For such deeds are not righteous in the nature of things, but by mere accident, just as those angels who made the world, have thought fit to constitute them, seeking, by means of such precepts, to bring men into bondage. On this account, he pledged himself that the world should be dissolved, and that those who are his should be freed from the rule of them who made the world. 4. Thus, then, the mystic priests belonging to this sect both lead profligate lives and practise magical arts, each one to the extent of his ability. They use exorcisms and incantations. Love-potions, too, and charms, as well as those beings who are called &#8220;Paredri&#8221; (familiars) and &#8220;Oniropompi&quot; (dream-senders), and whatever other curious arts can be had recourse to, are eagerly pressed into their service. They also have an image of Simon fashioned after the likeness of Jupiter, and another of Helena in the shape of Minerva; and these they worship. In fine, they have a name derived from Simon, the author of these most impious doctrines, being called Simonians; and from them &#8220;knowledge, falsely so called,&#8221; &#8220;received its beginning, as one may learn even from their own assertions. 5. The successor of this man was Menander, also a Samaritan by birth, and he, too, was a perfect adept in the practice of magic. He af. firms that the primary Power continues unknown to all, but that he himself is the person who has been sent forth from the presence of the invisible beings as a saviour, for the deliverance of men. The world was made by angels, whom, like Simon, he maintains to have been produced by Ennoea. He gives, too, as he affirms, by means of that magic which he teaches, knowledge to this effect, that one may overcome those very angels that made the world; for his disciples obtain the <span style='font-style:italic;'>resurrection </span>by being baptized into him, and can die no more, but remain in the possession of immortal youth.</p>

He represented himself, in <br/>a word, as being the loftiest of all powers, that <br/>is, the Being who is the Father over all, and he <br/>allowed himself to be called by whatsoever title <br/>men were pleased to address him. <br/>   2. Now this Simon of Samaria, from whom all <br/>sorts of heresies derive their origin, formed his <br/>sect out of the following materials : &#8212; Having <br/>redeemed from slavery at Tyre, a city of Phoe- <br/>nicia, a certain woman named Helena, he was <br/>in the habit of carrying her about with him. de- <br/>claring that this woman was the first conception <br/>of his mind, the mother of all, by whom, in <br/>the beginning, he conceived in his mind [the <br/>thought] of forming angels and archangels. For <br/>this Ennoea leaping forth from him, and com- <br/>prehending the will of her father, descended to <br/>the lower regions [of space], and generated <br/>angels and powers, by whom also he declared <br/>this world was formed. But after she had pro- <br/>duced them, she was detained by them through <br/>motives of jealousy, because they were unwilling <br/>to be looked upon as the progeny of any other <br/>being. As to himself, they had no knowledge <br/>of him whatever; but his Ennoea was detained <br/>by those powers and angels who had been pro- <br/>duced by her. She suffered all kinds of con- <br/>tumely from them, so that she could not return <br/>upwards to her father, but was even shut up in <br/>a human body, and for ages passed in succession <br/>from one female body to another, as from vessel <br/>to vessel. She was, for example, in that Helen <br/>on whose account the Trojan war was under- <br/>taken ; for whose sake also Stesichorus * was <br/>struck blind, because he had cursed her in his <br/>verses, but afterwards, repenting and writing <br/>what are called <span style='font-style:italic;'>Aasinodes, </span>in which he sang <br/>her praise, he was restored to sight.

Those angels who occupy the lowest heaven, that, namely, which is visible to us, formed all the things which are in the world, and made allotments among themselves of the earth and of those nations which are upon it. The chief of them is he who is thought to be the God of the Jews; and inasmuch as he desired to render the other nations subject to his own people, that is, the Jews, all the other princes resisted and opposed him. Wherefore all other nations were at enmity with his nation. But the father without birth and without name, perceiving that they would be destroyed, sent his own first-begotten Nous (he it is who is called Christ) to bestow deliverance on them that believe in him, from the power of those who made the world. He appeared, then, on earth as a man, to the nations of these powers, and wrought miracles. Wherefore he did not himself suffer death, but Simon, a certain man of Cyrene, being compelled, bore the cross in his stead ; so that this latter being transfigured by him, that he might be thought to be Jesus, was crucified, through ignorance and error, while Jesus himself received the form of Simon, and, standing by, laughed at them. For since he was an incorporeal power, and the Nous (mind) of the unborn father, he transfigured himself as he pleased, and thus ascended to him who had sent him, deriding them, inasmuch as he could not be laid hold of, and was invisible to all. Those, then, who know these things have been freed from the principalities who formed the world ; so that it is not incumbent on us to confess him who was crucified, but him who came in the form of a man, and was thought to be crucified, and was called Jesus, and was sent by the father, that by this dispensation he might destroy the works of the makers of the world. If any one, therefore, he declares, confesses the crucified, that man is still a slave, and under the power of those who formed our bodies; but he who denies him has been freed from these beings, and is acquainted with the dispensation of the unborn father.</p>

<p class='gtxt_footnote gtxt_lineated'>doctrine &#8212; the one in Syria, the other at Alex- <br/>andria. Saturninus, like Menander, set forth one <br/> father unknown to all, who made angels, arch- <br/>angels, powers, and potentates. The world, again, <br/>and all things therein, were made by a certain <br/>company of seven angels. Man, too, was the <br/>workmanship of angels, a shining image bursting <br/> forth below from the presence of the supreme <br/>power; and when they could not, he says, keep <br/>hold of this, because it immediately darted up- <br/>wards again, they exhorted each other, saying, <br/>&#8220;Let us make man after our image and like- <br/>ness.&#8221; He was accordingly formed, yet was <br/>unable to stand erect, through the inability of <br/>the angels to convey to him that power, but <br/>wriggled [on the ground] like a worm. Then <br/>the power above taking pity upon him, since he <br/>was made after his likeness, sent forth a spark of <br/>life, which gave man an erect posture, compacted <br/>his joints, and made him live. He declares, <br/>therefore, that this spark of life, after the death <br/>of a man, returns to those things which are of <br/>the same nature with itself, and the rest of the <br/>body is decomposed into its original elements. <br/>    2. He has also laid it down as a truth, that <br/>the Saviour was without birth, without body, and <br/>without figure, but was, by supposition, a visible <br/>man ; and he maintained that the God of the <br/>Jews was one of the angels; and, on this account, <br/>because all the powers wished to annihilate his <br/>father, Christ came to destroy the God of the <br/>Jews, but to save such as believe in him ; that is, <br/>those who possess the spark of his life. This <br/>heretic was the first to affirm that two kinds of <br/>men were formed by the angels, &#8212; the one <br/>wicked, and the other good. And since the <br/>demons assist the most wicked, the Saviour came <br/>for the destruction of evil men and of the <br/>demons, but for the salvation of the good. They <br/>declare also, that marriage and generation are <br/>from Satan.&#8221; Many of those, too, who belong <br/>to his school, abstain from animal food, and <br/>draw away multitudes by a feigned temperance <br/>of this kind. They hold, moreover, that some <br/>of the prophecies were uttered by those angels <br/>who made the world, and some by Satan; whom <br/>Saturninus represents as being himself an angel, <br/>the enemy of the creators of the world, but <br/>especially of the God of the Jews. <br/>    3. Basilides again, that he may appear to have <br/>discovered something more sublime and plausi- <br/> ble, gives an immense development to his doc- <br/> trines. He sets forth that Nous was first born <br/>of the unborn father, that from him, again, was <br/>born Logos, from Logos Phronesis, from Phro- <br/> nesis Sophia and Dynamis, and from Dynamis <br/>and Sophia the powers, and principalities, and <br/> angels, whom he also calls the <span style='font-style:italic;'>first; </span>and that <br/></p>

<p class='gtxt_column' style='text-indent:1em;'>5. Salvation belongs to the soul alone, for the body is by nature subject to corruption. He declares, too, that the prophecies were derived from those powers who were the makers of the world, but the law was specially given by their chief, who led the people out of the land of Egypt. He attaches no importance to [the question regarding] meats offered in sacrifice to idols, thinks them of no consequence, and makes use of them without any hesitation; he holds also the use of other things, and the practice of every kind of lust, a matter of perfect indifference. These men, moreover, practise magic, and use images, incantations, invocations, and every other kind of curious art. Coining also certain names as if they were those of the angels, they proclaim some of these as belonging to the first, and others to the second heaven ; and then they strive to set forth the names, principles, angels, and powers of the three hundred and sixty-five imagined heavens. They also affirm that the barbarous name in which the Saviour ascended and descended, is Caulacau.&quot;</p>
<p class='gtxt_column' style='text-indent:1em;'>6. He, then, who has learned [these things], and known all the angels and their causes, is rendered invisible and incomprehensible to the angels and all the powers, even as Caulacau also was. And as the son was unknown to all, so must they also be known by no one ; but while they know all, and pass through all, they themselves remain invisible and unknown to all; for, &#8220;Do thou,&#8221; they say, &#8220;know all, but let nobody know thee.&#8221; For this reason, persons of such a persuasion are also ready to recant [their opinions], yea, rather, it is impossible that they should suffer on account of a mere name, since they are like to all. The multitude, however, cannot understand these matters, but only one out of a thousand, or two out of ten thousand. They declare that they are no longer Jews, and that they are not yet Christians; and that it is not at all fitting to speak openly of their mysteries, but right to keep them secret by preserving silence.</p>
<p class='gtxt_column' style='text-indent:1em;'>7. They make out the local position of the three hundred and sixty-five heavens in the same way as do mathematicians. For, accepting the theorems of these latter, they have transferred them to their own type of doctrine.

They also hold that Jesus was the son of Joseph, and was just like other men, with the exception that he differed from them in this respect, that Homo his soul was stedfast and pure, he perfectly remembered those things which he had witnessed 3 within the sphere of the unbegotten God. On this account, a power descended upon him from the Father, that by means of it he might escape from the creators of the world; and they say that it, after passing through them all, and remaining in all points free, ascended again to him, and to the powers,&quot; which in the same way embraced like things to itself. They further declare, that the soul of Jesus, although educated in the practices of the Jews, regarded these with contempt, and that for this reason he was endowed with faculties, by means of which he destroyed those passions which dwelt in men as a punishment [for their sins].</p>

The soul, therefore, which is like that of Christ can despise those rulers who were the creators of the world, and, in like manner, receives power for accomplishing the same resuits. This idea has raised them to such a pitch of pride, that some of them declare themselves similar to Jesus; while others, still more mighty, maintain that they are superior to his disciples. such as Peter and Paul, and the rest of the apostles, whom they consider to be in no respect inferior to Jesus. For their souls, descending from the same sphere as his, and therefore despising in like manner the creators of the world. are deemed worthy of the same power, and again depart to the same place.

So unbridled is their madness, that they declare they have in their power all things which are irreligious and impious, and are at liberty to practise them; for they maintain that things are evil or good, simply in virtue of human opinion.3 They deem it necessary, therefore, that by means of transmigration from body to body, souls should have experience of every kind of life as well as every kind of action (unless, indeed, by a single incarnation, one may be able to prevent any need for others, by once for all, and with equal completeness, doing all those things which we dare not either speak or hear of, nay, which we must not even conceive in our thoughts, nor think credible, if any such thing is mooted among those persons who are our fellow-citizens), in order that, as their writings express it, their souls, having made trial of every kind of life, may, at their departure, not be wanting in any particular. It is necessary 4 to insist upon this, lest, on account of some one thing being still wanting to their deliverance, they should be compelled once more to become incarnate. They affirm that for this reason Jesus spoke the following parable : &#8212;&#8220;Whilst thou art with thine adversary in the way, give all diligence, that thou mayest be delivered from him, lest he give thee up to the judge, and the judge surrender thee to the officer, and he cast thee into prison. Verily, I say unto thee, thou shalt not go out thence until thou pay the very-last farthing.&#8221; 5 They also declare the &#8220;adversary&#8221; is one of those angels who are in the world, whom they call the Devil, maintaining that he was formed for this purpose, that he might lead those souls which have perished from the world to the to preme Ruler. They describe him also as being chief among the makers of the world, and maintain that he delivers such souls [as have been mentioned to another angel, who ministers to him, that he may shut them up in other bodies; for they declare that the body is &#8220;the prison.&#8221; Again, they interpret these expressions, &#8220;Thou shalt not go out thence until thou pay the very last farthing,&#8221; as meaning that no one can escape from the power of those angels</p>

In this way also all souls are saved, whether their own which, guarding against all delay, participate in all sorts of actions during one incarnation, or those, again, who, by passing from body to body, are set free, on fulfilling and accomplishing what is requisite in every form of life into which they are sent, so that at length they shall no longer be [shut up) in the body. <span style='font-style:italic;'></span>5. And thus, if ungodly, unlawful, and forbidden actions are committed among them, I can no longer find ground for believing them to be such.&quot; And in their writings we read as follows, the interpretation which they give [of their views], declaring that Jesus spoke in a mystery to His disciples and apostles privately, and that they requested and obtained permission to hand down the things thus taught them, to others who should be worthy and believing. We are saved, indeed, by means of faith and love; but all other things, while in their nature indifferent, are reckoned by the opinion of men &#8212; some good and some evil, there being nothing really evil by nature. 6. Others of them employ outward marks, branding their disciples inside the lobe of the right ear. From among these also arose Marcellina, who came to Rome under [the episcopate of J Anicetus, and, holding these doctrines, she led multitudes astray. They style themselves Gnostics.
