<h1>
Statistical Science publishes Bible Codes Refutation</h1>

<font size=+1>
<p>
The only paper published in a refereed scientific journal
that claims to find evidence for the reality of the Bible Codes is the
paper&nbsp;<i>Equidistant
Letter Sequences in the Book of Genesis</i>, by Doron Witztum, Eliyahu
Rips, and Yoav Rosenberg (WRR), Statistical Science, Vol. 9 (1994) 429-438.</font>
<p><font size=+1>We are now happy to announce that, after review by four
senior statisticians chosen by the journal, Statistical Science has published
a thorough rebuttal: Vol. 14 (1999) 150-173.</p>

<p>The new paper is
<i>Solving the Bible Code Puzzle</i>,
by Brendan McKay, Dror Bar-Natan, Maya Bar-Hillel,
and Gil Kalai. Here is the abstract:</p>

<blockquote><font size=+0>A paper of Witztum, Rips and Rosenberg in this
journal in 1994 made the extraordinary claim that the Hebrew text of the
Book of Genesis encodes events which did not occur until millennia after
the text was written. In reply, we argue that Witztum, Rips and Rosenberg's
case is fatally defective, indeed that their result merely reflects on
the choices made in designing their experiment and collecting the data
for it. We present extensive evidence in support of that conclusion. We
also report on many new experiments of our own, all of which failed to
detect the alleged phenomenon.</font></blockquote>

  <b>Press Release</b>
  <br>The publication of the paper was accompanied by a press release from
  the journal's parent society, the Institute for Mathematical Statistics.
  It includes the introduction to the paper written by the Executive
  Editor of Statistical Science at the time the paper of Witztum et al. was
  published, Robert Kass.  Read it <a href="http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/codes/StatSci/PressRelease.html">here</a>.

<li>
  <b>Data</b>
  <br>Due to space limitations, the paper refers to several
  experiments without presenting the data for them. That data is presented
  <a href="http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/codes/StatSci/data.html">here</a>.

  <b>Citations</b>
  <br>Due to the volatile nature of the web, pages and links
  tend to change or disappear. Thus, we preserve <a href="http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/codes/StatSci/refs.html">here</a>
  many of the web documents referred to by the paper, in the form they were
  in at the time of acceptance of the paper. We also provide scans of a few
  less accessible documents.

  <b>Discussion</b>
  <br>In this place we will reference serious critiques of our paper, and
  sometimes comment on them.  Readers should be aware that our paper is not
  an opening gambit, but a summary of years of investigation that included
  extensive debates with Witztum and Rips.  We do not feel obliged to
  reply to every recycled quibble, especially to those already answered
  in our paper.
  <ul>
    <!-- <br>A reply from Dr Rips is promised to appear
    <a href="http://www.ma.huji.ac.il/~rips/">here</a>. -->
    <li>
      Witztum's "refuted refutation" concerns the appellations we found
      that perform strongly in War and Peace.  It is thoroughly refuted
      <a href="http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/codes/WNP/Rebuttal.pdf">here</a> (PDF).<br>
      In Dec 2000, Witztum published what he again called a "complete
      refutation", but few of our points are even mentioned let alone
      refuted.  As a postscript to this sorry episode, we make a
      <a href="http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/codes/StatSci/central_rep.html">few final remarks</a> that include proof
      that Witztum's own expert Shlomo Havlin does not himself adhere to
      the "rules" that Witztum claims his data to be based on.
      (August 2001)
    <li>
      Doron Witztum has challenged our account of the history of the
      permutation test used in WRR's paper.  In reply, we provide a
      <a href="http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/codes/StatSci/permtest">detailed analysis</a>, including scans of
      the primary source documents.  (September 1999)
    <li>
      Another paper of Witztum alleges that our experiment with Dr.
      Simcha Emanuel was improperly conducted and the result in fact
      supports codes!  In <a href="http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/codes/StatSci/emanuel_rep.html">our reply</a>,
      we catch Witztum with his fingers in the till.  (July 2001)
    <li>
      Witztum has further claimed to refute our observations about his
      choices of ways to write dates in Hebrew.
      <a href="http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/codes/StatSci/dates_rep.html">Our reply</a> shows that his case is
      nonexistent, as it is based on false procedures or incorrect data.
      (July 2001)
    <li>
      Witztum has replied to our analysis of variations,
      arguing that it is either invalid or proves something different
      from what we claim.  <a href="http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/codes/StatSci/var_rep.html">Our reply</a> shows
      where his errors are while nevertheless questioning one of our
      own previous conclusions.  (Note: both Witztum's and our papers
      on this subject require deep knowledge of the background and
      some mathematical expertise.)
      (March 2002)
     <li>
      Witztum has written some comments on the issue of changes to the
      text of the Torah.  He appears to have abandoned his earlier
      approach, which was to claim that the Koren text "can be relied on",
      in favour of alternative ad hoc arguments.  We are not going to
      reply to them.  However, for people who are interested in this topic,
      we present some relevant <a href="http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/codes/StatSci/text.html">articles by scholars</a>.
      (March 2002)
     <li>
      Witztum found quite a few errors in Barry Simon's replication of
      the experiment of Gans, but fixing them still leaves a completely
      negative result.  More seriously, two careful replications
      attempted by a committee of supporters and skeptics, using data
      compiled by independent experts, could not find the slightest
      trace of codes.  We have a <a href="http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/codes/gans_exp.html">preliminary
      report</a> available.  <img src="http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/codes/StatSci/new2b.gif"> (September 2002).
     <li>
      Apart from Witztum's efforts, the major reply to our work was
      the "primer" of Harold Gans.  In reply we will make a
      <a href="http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/codes/StatSci/gans_rep.html">few comments</a>.
      <img src="http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/codes/StatSci/new2b.gif"> (January 2003).
