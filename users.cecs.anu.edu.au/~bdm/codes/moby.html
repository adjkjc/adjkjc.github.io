<meta name="description" content="Michael Drosnin's prediction
 of the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin, described in his book
 The Bible Code, is shown to be similar to many other assassination
 predictions in the book Moby Dick.  This reduction to an absurdity 
 proves that Drosnin is wrong in claiming that his prediction is
 unique, or even amazing.">

The following challenge was made by Michael Drosnin:
<p>
<tt>
<center>
  When my critics find a message about the assassination of
  a prime minister encrypted in Moby Dick, I'll believe them.<br>
  <i>(Newsweek, Jun 9, 1997)</i>

<p>

Note that English with the vowels included is far less flexible
than Hebrew when it comes to making letters into words.
Nevertheless, without further ado, we present our answer to 
Mr Drosnin's challenge.

<h3> Yitzhak Rabin</h3>

Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin was shot dead on November 4, 1995.
His assassin was Igal Amir, who fired three shots of which one hit
Rabin fatally in the chest.
Amir was a student at Bar-Ilan University, and associated with
an underground group Eyal which modelled itself on a historical
terrorist group called Lehi.
Amir was angered by Rabin's role in the "Peace Process" and 
especially by the Oslo accords.

<h3> The text </h3>

You can verify the above messages, and find your own, 
using the public-domain text of Moby Dick.  
It can be downloaded as a <a href="data/md.txt.gz">gzipped text file</a>

<h3>Princess Diana's death</h3>

The death of Lady Diana was also predicted by Moby Dick.
See the <a href="diana.html">Princess Di</a> page for details.

<h3>A note to the credulous</h3>

It has come to my attention that some people have taken this
page as claiming that Moby Dick <b>really predicted</b> the
assassinations of famous people.
Please be assured that none of these patterns happened 
by other than pure random chance.

<p>
No laws of probability are violated here, or even stretched
a little.
<b>That is also true of Drosnin's book</b>, which is the
whole point of this page.
Once you learn Drosnin's rules (none) and the method (a bit
of messy programming) you can find things like this anywhere.
The reason it looks amazing is that the number of possible
things to look for, and the number of places to look, is
much greater than you imagine.
