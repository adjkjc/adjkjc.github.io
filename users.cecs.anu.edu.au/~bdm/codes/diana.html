This page continues our answer to Michael Drosnin.
Previously we showed that the English text of Moby Dick contains
"predictions" of a number of 
<a href="moby.html">famous assassinations</a>, using the
same method that he used on the Bible.

<p>
Now we show that the tragic death of Princess Di was also 
"predicted" in Moby Dick.

<hrule width=1>

<p>
<b>Lady Diana</b>, a member of the British <b>royal</b> family,
died in a car accident together with her boyfriend <b>Dodi</b>
and the driver <b>Henri Paul</b>.
<p>
As the text says, she was at last <b>mortal in these jaws of death</b>.

<p> The code for "Lady Diana" is unique in the entire book.
