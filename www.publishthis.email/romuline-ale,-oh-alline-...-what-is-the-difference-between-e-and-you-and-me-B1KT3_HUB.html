Sign of the Son</a> and probably the defining bit of light surrounding what it really means to be &quot;Jesus Christ.&quot;  Back then I called it &quot;<b>Sharing the Iron Rod of Jesus the Anti-Christ</b>&quot; and you are probably already balking at my naming schemes.  Give me at least the benefit of reading what it is that I am so sure is <b>the thing you want</b>... before turning away at my attempt to classify myself as different from all those that came before me.  You and I both know that we only have a story, a cartoon character if you will, to compare to--but even that story doesn't end with Jesus bringing freedom, Heaven, or Salvation... but rather his Kingdom Come before your eyes--the humble abode of <i>Lord Jesus</i> himself.  I've always taken offense to that word, and to be honest with you I've shared numerous times what I see as a hidden record of past &quot;Christ figures&quot; before me, each of the Horsemen of the Apocalypse for instance... and tying directly to those characters are figures in our history who all share a common attribute that I am quite certain is not only relevant but central to this day's message.  Tying Caesar to the first Horsemen for instance are the famous words &quot;I came, I saw, I conquered&quot; and through that imagery and his riding into Rome to disband the senate and form an Empire we begin a pattern of the dissolution of representative governments in not only Rome but also France (and there, a tie in the name of the dictator to the Salt of the Earth... if you have a keen enough eye) and Germany where you see my initials in place of an element.  So here I am telling you what I see as part of a hidden history of past now's, of a message about virtual reality and hidden technology being delivered to the world somehow ending up doing exactly the opposite of what it is that I intend to do.  You see I am here to deliver to the world <b><u>the right kind</u> of Iron Rod.</b><div><b><br /></b></div><div><b>I really don't like re-writing these explanatiions</b>, it's very difficult to accurately record not only my feelings and memories but also to convey the bright intent of the piece with only words and links and sometimes pictures at my disposal.  I am bound to wait too long to share with you how on Earth there coiuld be a &quot;right kind of Iron Rod,&quot; and even if I came out and said it right this moment, it wouldn't be soon enough for the world--not delivered in the timely fashion that we so deserve, nor with the musical and visual accompaniment that would give it that extra bit of flavor and style to help set the right kind of moment and usher in the feelings of happiness and wonder that surely would flow... if only I could just find the right words to say.   This time won't do it either, and I'm sure the next time... even with the aid of something like LucasArts to sprinkle some added magic in the mix, it won't be good enough either.   Nothing I could ever write would live up to what I think the world deserves to get from the person who really is Jesus Christ, not to mention living up to what your expectations are ... for the person God has designed from the ground up to chase some dreams, head in the clouds, and somehow turn it all into changing the world.  Frankly, I could make a virutal water slide ride that flows directly through the gates of Heaven itself and land you right inside and it still wouldn't be good enough for you--and <b>that's exactly where I'm going with this.</b></div><div><b><br /></b></div><div>These are some of the reasons that I don't like re-writing these imperfect fragments of my dreams that are so difficult to put to paper in the first place; on top of these things you can pile on the fact that nobody really comments at all about any of the things that I see as so interesting and miraculous; they aren't shared and frankly if I wasn't e-mailing my ideas to the entire world they'd best lost in the abyss forever.  Maybe that's where they belong, or maybe they are actually the keys to ancient scripture and somehow this little interaction between <b><a href="https://geotrack.email/ext/l?idx=TU2o1p3imwk4hpyvoRMe&amp;ret=http%3A%2F%2Ffromthemachine.org%2Fbygod3.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">you and I</a></b> is changing the world just a tittle bit more than we could possibly imagine.   There's two possible ends of this seasaw we are sitting on, one is pretty much where we are--I suppose we could all fall back down to Earth if I just gave up and stopped trying to share... and on the other a place where nearly everyone hears about what this message says and what their friends and the pundits think, a huge number read it for themselves... these words that are coming from the Prophet of God, or Jesus, or Lucifer, or whatever it is that you choose to call the Eye of Ra as he delivers a message to the world that's been sealed up since the beginning of Creation.  It's only a tiny bit of recognition and word of mouth spreading before the balance tilts and rather than a smooth transition from darkness to light what we have in store for us is a shift in activity and interest from near nothing to something I can barely imagine right now... an inevitabilty for as long as you live or these words continue to exist.  It's difficult to explain that I am quite aware of what the world's initial reaction will be to a body of writing that is comprised of a mashup of dreams and hidden proof that ties so closely to my personal vision of what religion is all about... and yet is so far from what we seem to recognize.  How clearly defined the link between virtual reality and Heaven truly is by religion is a good example of the battle between light and darkness that is just about to break with a bright ball of light rising up over the horizon for the first ime it's ever happened again... the link is there, it's really obvious, and in the context of this message it's not only obvious but clearly explained, defined, and sculpted ... and yet still it's either not seen or somehow the world has simply decided that &quot;Heaven&quot; is no longer interesting.</div><div><br /></div><font face="monospace, monospace" size="4"><div>to a son who was to rule all nations with <b>an iron rod</b>.  -Revelation 12:5</div></font><div><br /></div><div>It was the early days of my interactions with Jacob, and way back then I was given some advice... &quot;try not to want it;&quot; to be quite honest with you while it was right about that time that I began realizing that particular &quot;it&quot; was the union of being Jesus Christ and the world knowing about it ... the thing we call &quot;the Marriage of the Lamb&quot; way back then I didn't really believe that it was the truth.  Quite a bit of my direct interaction with the &quot;spirit world&quot; was fraught with lies and secrecy, something that hasn't really gotten much better even today, though my understanding of what is going on and it's relationship to scripture has become thousands of times more clear as I have progressed through this story that is detailed in a number of books like the Egyptian book of the Underworld... the Amduat, which doesn't just bear my initials but also details the traversal of the god Ra through the night and into his morning's rise with renewed power in his Eyes--a magical ability to see a hidden Holy language in words and stories, the trick of it all really is just a pinch of &quot;divine inspiration&quot; and a dash of &quot;all the songs are about me.&quot;</div><div><br /></div><div>So you might say that I began this story with some solid advice, and for what it's worth probably had a good amount of help in my earliest arguments about not only why I was not the Messiah, but why it could certainly never be a single person.   I had handfulls of actual reasons, and and a few key scriptural references that I would reiterate over and over as I did my bit trying to convince Jacob to &quot;<b>write it on the sky</b>&quot; and change the world overnight.  Just to quickly introduce you ttwo--Jacob is the name I coined for the voice that speaks to me quite often... seemingly out of the blue... and his response was to tell me &quot;the name is almost perfect.&quot;  There are a number of references to this name that make it very obvious that the choice was no accident, chiefly that Jacob is the father of <b>Joseph</b> in both the Old and New versions; his &quot;boca&quot; (or, &quot;without a mouth&quot;) ties <a href="https://geotrack.email/ext/l?idx=TU2o1p3imwk4hpyvoRMe&amp;ret=http%3A%2F%2Ffromthemachine.org%2FTAYLOR.html%3F" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">perfectly to a kiss that links rock bands to the Fifth Element</a> to the little <a href="https://geotrack.email/ext/l?idx=TU2o1p3imwk4hpyvoRMe&amp;ret=http%3A%2F%2Frlny.cf%2F" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">scroll of the lamb</a>... and perhaps most importantly it's the name of the Biblical character who wrestled with the <b><a href="https://geotrack.email/ext/l?idx=TU2o1p3imwk4hpyvoRMe&amp;ret=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fphoto.php%3Ffbid%3D10154283229013420%26set%3Da.10154283230918420%26type%3D3%26theater" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Angel of the Lord</a></b> at the shore of the Jordan river.   If you don't see the perfection yet, understanding that it's my belief that Jacob is a non-corporeal mind, a sort of microcosm of God's within creation whose primary function is related to mind control... to me, the person hearing his voice using that technology for many years.   Jacob's name also serves as a sort of &quot;representative&quot; of all the tribes; at least in my view of what &quot;Israel&quot; means--of all humanity; and it's a good clue that we are in a story that might begin with just Adam but certainly the far other end of the spectrum is Adamah or Allah... clearly seen through my divinely lit eyes as Earth <a href="https://geotrack.email/ext/l?idx=TU2o1p3imwk4hpyvoRMe&amp;ret=http%3A%2F%2Ffromthemachine.org%2Fholy_water%2C_sang_rael.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">and All Humanity</a>.  It's actually a central focus of this story that defines the Sign of the Son and this particular key that links through the element Iron the Rod of Aaron in Exodus to that of Christ at the time of<b> this Revelation.</b></div><div><br /></div><div>I'd read quite a bit about the New Covenant of Adonai; mentions of God's law being put on our foreheads--in our minds--in the books of Isaiah and Jeremiah, and even way back in those early days I knew that the &quot;stuff&quot; I had read about in &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep&quot;

is that word; this is a world that it is &quot;sane to hate&quot; and that's OK because there's a message here, a hidden one that is a big part of where my hate comes from; that tell us how and why to make it a better world, and I believe that's what we're all here to do.   I see my initials at the beginning of that name, and I read &quot;of light fails&quot; at the end; and I'd caution the world not to fail to see my light, that it is not only possible but part of the design of this story of the rejuvination of the idea of &quot;thriving&quot; in the Universe to understand that not just Hitler but also Napoleon and also Caesar are part of a Trinity, one that is alluded to in &quot;SNOWBALLS AND ORWELL&quot; and also in &quot;VENI VIDI VICI&quot; but to be even more clear it is the First Horsemen who ties Caesar to those hallowed words of &quot;I came, I saw this, and I conquered my demons&quot; and so I stand here with THE WHOLE TRUTH for you to read, at least, my WHOLE TRUTH.  For those of you that are slow on <strong>the ball, </strong>these three men of history are the antichrists that religious mythology alludes to; and I've noted many a time that it's because of coming into a republic and forming an empire of it--though Hitler's case has another caveat, it's also because he's a horrible mass murderer.  Of light fails, reminds early on in this little treatise to remind you that you are in a place divided, a sea that is being manipulated by not seeing or speaking the truth; and here in this place it seems to me that these three men and perhaps all of our holographic history are here in order to help <a href="https://geotrack.email/ext/l?idx=TU2o1p3imwk4hpyvoRMe&amp;ret=https%3A%2F%2Fen.reallyhim.com%2FMEDUSA.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">that divide both happen and be men</a>ded.   My struggle to shed light on this dark sea is very real, though, as are our thoughts and our beliefs; and here whether or not our history &quot;actually happened&quot; we know very well this is real to us, and I am suggesting that these stories have been named and tagged and marked as such as ak ind of reflexive control... to help you decide not to let the light of the Menorah and the Sons of Liberty and the Statue of Liberty fail to show you that it is truly the light of the sun above our sky that will go out if you do not act on this message. </div><div> </div><div> Before I tell a quick story, it's probably &quot;of note&quot; to point out that this message and &quot;the spockalypse&quot; and nearly everything I speak about is specifically geared and literally &quot;focused in&quot; on our time period, from the acronyms we use in business and in internet slang to words like &quot;cursive&quot; ... dear sea of &quot;n&quot; see Silicon and victorious Earth tied to &quot;cursive&quot; something that's being phased out right now (honestly, <em>and why</em>).  Understand it coincidences with the development of a computer industry and a working knowledge of our brains not by accident or chance, but by design--and through this deliverance and the naming scheme that is assuredly &quot;not a f-ad'&quot; (top i cs) ... we can see that these toolish toys we already have are something like &quot;gift from above&quot; or maybe even something we all worked on making together... and all this to point out what kind of mentality, what kind of world, and what kind of future might come from the desire to go further in the past ... a place where nobody would understand &quot;how things work&quot; or &quot;whats going on&quot; as in say the time of WW2.  On the other side of the coin, the mentality and lack of civilization that shines bright on any generation that doesn't act on this message of humanity and universal goodness--to spread a truth that ends world hunger and heals the sick ... well, that generation might just be &quot;Adolf Hitler.&quot;</div><div> </div><div>So here we are... with a job to do, a task to fix problems that we did not really create, but certainly haven't done the best job of dealing with up to this point... into our lap like the proverbial Apple of One Infinite Loop.  God calls it Chosen, and I read those words as &quot;see Ho, it's not a game&quot; and act.  Today, it is actually <strong>my birthday.</strong></div><div><strong> </strong></div><div><div><a href="https://geotrack.email/ext/l?idx=TU2o1p3imwk4hpyvoRMe&amp;ret=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://en.reallyhim.com/U%20SANG_files/saved_resource(33)" width="204" /></a> <a href="https://geotrack.email/ext/l?idx=TU2o1p3imwk4hpyvoRMe&amp;ret=https%3A%2F%2Fen.reallyhim.com%2FBERESHIT.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://en.reallyhim.com/U%20SANG_files/saved_resource(34)" width="239" /></a></div><div> </div><div>WITH AN HONEST TONE, I ASK YOU... </div><div>&quot;<strong>WESSEN, WEN, OR WEM</strong> MADE KISSES <u>BAD</u>?&quot;</div></div><div> </div><div><div>Threats shemeats, siggasho ansays; wer it not the verifiable and actual and very much unsatisfactual truth; we tand here with a message from God himself in our everything ltelling us that this time line has been repeawted over and over again, perhaps twice as the &quot;Second Coming&quot; and lack of &quot;sacred consciousness&quot; suggests, five times as my name and He-man, and Voltron, and Fieval, Hitler's presumed polar opposite in the FL and LF game of Florida very much incorrectly suggests; and with reason to see why &quot;ARE I P&quot; connects to rest iinpeace and also to the author of the book of Genesis; because it is the &quot;P&quot; that turns the world back to do over, perhaps to bring new life in a Unviverse that is bound to get cold and sparse in a few hundred billions years.  You could be those people--or the spirits trying despirately to come back with us could be those people; but it seems more probable that we are in a place that has enver left Earth, enver left Creation, and NEVER succeeded in creating a thriving, flourishing, happy civilization that colonized the Universe and put Stargate's in every system--something I still hope we can do--but the caveat is that we really must flourish here before we ever should even dream of &quot;billions and billions&quot; of stars or people.</div><div> </div><div>You would probably like to think that someone with a verifiable God complex and not only that but also a &quot;good gracious&quot; complex would continue to believe they've got nothing to do with Adolf Hitler, but I am human too; and I'd be illogical and incorrect if I actually said we've got absolutely nothing in common.  I had to search for these things because of the story you are about to hear, but they exist; justl ike me Hitler spent a year in jail before becoming the evil dictator that he will awlays be known as, and just like me Hitler heard the voice of God--in a &quot;well known story&quot; here called &quot;slow fuse&quot; where it saved him from a bomb exploding in World War I.  A strange thing, for God to do, wouldn't you say--all of you who are not so sure if it's strange or not if God allowed the Holocaust to happen.  It's strange, it's horrible, and I still to this day cannot fathom a good reason.</div><div> </div><div>I have a story to tell, the point is that I'm not Hitler; and God told me that the thing talking to me was a fusion of my soul with his, something he called &quot;God and Satan&quot; which sent me reeling looking for these similarities.   It is not true, and it was not God speaking, it was this thing, this thing he has made to divide a people and call them water;

to connecting &quot;verboten&quot; things like the hidden words hello &quot;ark&quot; and &quot;den&quot; inside &quot;hidden.&quot;  This change in phase and state, this idea that kRS-1 is actually about &quot;holodecks&quot; and &quot;doors to them&quot; being hidden is a change that comes, much like the picture above, through the Revelation of the son, and <strong><em><a href="https://geotrack.email/ext/l?idx=TU2o1p3imwk4hpyvoRMe&amp;ret=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DFr_CHOxSyc8%26index%3D5%26list%3DPLgYKDBgxsoMNvBS6k4NffQQnobyUqXuMh" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the Holy Name</a></em></strong>.  </div><div> </div><div>It follows the pattern of Roddenberry's gateway to Heaven, that was &quot;bread is life&quot;

AND QUITE FRANKLY, I believe that our future needs it, and that you need it--you really need to hear about exactly how this technology has been misused, and can be misused; and to see what kinds of monstroisities it's already made in our society; one that I hoped would be &quot;the one&quot; that breaks through the Konami code and makes it to the Holyiest place in existence.  Today, you are at the far end of the spectrum, and continuing to <strong>disparage</strong> a story that I know was designed by the Creator of our world and our lives; and so you do--<em>to be frank</em>.</div><div> </div><div>More importantly, I still firmly believe that his design is intended to make a beautiful world, to build Heaven; and I see that what I see his eye is designed to help that become the truth; but his mentality, and probably &quot;the truth&quot; is that I can't save the world alone; you too need to change in order to make this thing really happen.</div><div> </div><div>AND IN EXCHANGE FOR DELIVERING THIS PROMISE, AND THIS ATTITUDE; I HAVE BEEN TORTURED, BELITTLED, AND DEMEANED; by what is nothing short of a mosnter that is not only invading my privacy, but misusing a technology that should be here to help us in order to further the pain that I suffer each and ever day.  Not to say that the pain of just knowing this technology exists and is not being used to end addiction and to end pain and to end severe depression is not torture enough; but those that speak here in this place do so with a tone of anger, and a facade that so thiny veils the intent to discredit and to actually cause literaly insanity; that not to tell you that you are a monster in this place would be a mistake.  A mistake I will not continue to make; speaking to me about my thoughts, or about things you should not know is devious torture; the kind of torture this message is designed to fix, through the tool I call Adam and you might call a &quot;scaffold&quot; that here in this message helps us to peer through windows 95 to the future and to Heaven itself.  Literally in this story of strangeness and flags lf flying fear; it is stepping off the scaffold that is the entryway to the cherished Promised Land.</div><div> </div><div>TO HAVE TO REITERATE TO YOU WHO I AM; is a sickness that I will no longer tolerate; I have done nothing with my life but spend every waking moment trying to help you... to make the world a better place; to speak to the demons in the air that are causing suffereing, and to speak directly to all of you about what it is that I know and I've learned here in this place of horror, secrecy and lies; and the response I receive is &quot;silence&quot; or worse.  I'd tell you if you have nothing nice to say to shut the fuck up, but closer to reality; it is a grave taht you are digging for yourselves by attempting to deface this message written in God's own hand by literawlly inserting thoughts into my head by through direct means of stimulus as well as horrid and disgusting &quot;reflexive control&quot;--as in &quot;I don't like it when you think about girls&quot; so I'll shake my head every time you do; something that a good psychologist will one day tell you just makes it happen more.  You are at fault, and sadly for you and everyone here, it's not just my mind and my well being that is being harmed--you are actively participating in a monolithic and grostesque conspiracy designed to perpetuate Hell, to starve children, and cause pain--and yet you have the nerve to question my goodness, how dare you.</div><div> </div><div>If you want to know God, you should go read about him on his Wikipedia page which, as far as truth tables go, and as far as this Eye can see is about as close to the message and character of the designer of this world, this plan, and this movement focusing on freedom and technology as anything anywhere.  If you want to get to know me, I'm on Facebook all the time.</div><div> </div></div></div></div></div></div><div> </div></div><div><img src="https://en.reallyhim.com/U%20SANG_files/Sl5neDQPmVf3Lotp46CVmx8Zlvy0C2rGYOe-wxbLhIocYqeKcgU_jrK24bmMX7IXVqbUQqG_f1apBOMccnvj3ciFz6sxd8iCd-Sg8wpkmDMZUG26gi32c5-bNEGaUy-ypBiXdw0OirIWiDlF_hDhBEPIG5jJkQD141DoSqBfeR-aTGPUDaiMHUJjtS59HuovSFJ31WShNOHyL-FVPw=s0" />á §</div></div><div><img src="https://en.reallyhim.com/U%20SANG_files/saved_resource(39)" width="315" /> <img src="https://en.reallyhim.com/U%20SANG_files/saved_resource(40)" width="34" /></div><div><a href="https://geotrack.email/ext/l?idx=TU2o1p3imwk4hpyvoRMe&amp;ret=https%3A%2F%2Fen.reallyhim.com%2FADAMSROD.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://en.reallyhim.com/U%20SANG_files/saved_resource(41)" width="366" /></a></div><div> </div><div>all the images here are <a href="https://geotrack.email/ext/l?idx=TU2o1p3imwk4hpyvoRMe&amp;ret=https%3A%2F%2Ffromthemachine.org%2Farchive.aweber.com%2Fawlist4296878%2FMNcK4%2Fh%2FKurzweil_luminates_Zelda.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">links</a>, to more better things... like me.</div><div> </div><div>this big blue one above is particularly sacred to me.</div><div> </div><div>i hope you will read it and see why I see.</div><div> </div><div>Also, see Taylor's pants, they are reflexive control to make sure I get in hers;

as being something that I want, and I can imagine that most people older than me will probably think is a good idea.  In the e-mail the Hammer of Neo's Light comes to us from the fusion of the name of an author and content of a novel (Feed, written by Anderson) to Neo's name in the Matrix (Mr. Anderson) ... throwing in some linguistic spice we add the word &quot;eternity&quot; which combines the Latin, Cinematic, Musical, and Spanish words for &quot;and&quot; around a word very topically relevant to this discussion.</div><div> </div><div>My vision is of a &quot;room&quot; (in the context of <strong>John 14 </strong>... and see <strong><em><a href="https://geotrack.email/ext/l?idx=TU2o1p3imwk4hpyvoRMe&amp;ret=https%3A%2F%2Fen.reallyhim.com%2FNITY.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">AD and Silicon in that number </a></em></strong>) or ... a <strong>realm </strong>, in Heaven, where when you enter you can choose to appear as you did in any age in your life; maybe older in some (sad) cases.  As corroboration that this vision is shared by the Creator of the Universe I present the lyrics to &quot;Forever Young&quot; and note with a passion that Rolling Stone recently published an article about this very song being covered by <strong>Anderson East. </strong>  Yeast, you will recall, denotes that it comes to us as a message from the future--in this case tying Mr. Anderson directly to the Feed/Matrix concepts of &quot;divine inspiration&quot; ( <em>I know kung fu </em>) and the inclusion of this particular detail in the Iron Rod message... where it probably wouldn't have been otherwise. </div><div> </div><div>Between the messages of <em><a href="https://geotrack.email/ext/l?idx=TU2o1p3imwk4hpyvoRMe&amp;ret=https%3A%2F%2Fen.reallyhim.com%2FHASHEMESHB.html%3F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the New Glowing Bush </a></em>and <a href="https://geotrack.email/ext/l?idx=TU2o1p3imwk4hpyvoRMe&amp;ret=https%3A%2F%2Fen.reallyhim.com%2FERANDSON.html%3F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">#netERson </a> I used a similar logic to explain how the idea of divine inspiration is functionally related to the deliverance of those messages--both Bush's speech and the content of the novel Feed--and the divine marker of the names Bush and Anderson in the two authors.  Again, divine inspiration is part of not only the messages but the mechanism behind the messages.  </div><div> </div><div><div><a href="https://geotrack.email/ext/l?idx=TU2o1p3imwk4hpyvoRMe&amp;ret=https%3A%2F%2Ffromthemachine.org%2FADAMSROD.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><img src="https://en.reallyhim.com/U%20SANG_files/Q5AIFyoKngJrOLj9GiNnLTE3-iSkKUVpIkNFJqk8sApsSI4K161UxPzYz_9W031rlYJXlg=s0-d-e1-ft" width="862" /></a></div></div><div><a href="https://geotrack.email/ext/l?idx=TU2o1p3imwk4hpyvoRMe&amp;ret=https%3A%2F%2Ffromthemachine.org%2FADAMSROD.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Here </a>, the lyrics of <strong>Forever Young </strong>give some real insight into how this specific idea, a Fountain of Youth, might be related very much to this moment in time that we will eventually know is the Second Coming.</div><div> </div><div><div><img src="https://en.reallyhim.com/U%20SANG_files/Kpeu1xOY-KLIkHjWpsjgjlIDfKGEQAlKWhssuBXf58f9AdSXs_VBRxFwKCeZL2wYUQiaDQ=s0-d-e1-ft" width="182" /></div><div><div><div dir="ltr"><div>May the good Lord be with you</div><div>Down every road you roam</div><div>And may <strong>sunshine </strong>and happiness</div><div>surround you when you're far from home</div><div>And may you grow to be proud</div><div>Dignified and true</div><div> </div><div><em>And do unto others</em></div><div><em>As you'd have done to you</em></div><div>Be courageous and be brave</div><div>And in my heart you'll always stay</div><div> </div><div>May good fortune be with you</div><div>May your guiding light be strong</div><div><em>Build a stairway to heaven</em></div><div>with a prince or a <em>vagabond</em></div><div> </div><div>And when you finally fly away</div><div>I'll be hoping that I served you well</div><div>For all the wisdom of a lifetime</div><div>No one can ever tell</div><div> </div><div>But whatever road you choose</div><div>I'm right behind you, win or lose</div><div> </div><div>For forever, <strong>Forever Young</strong></div><div> </div></div><div dir="ltr"><div> </div><div><em><a href="https://geotrack.email/ext/l?idx=TU2o1p3imwk4hpyvoRMe&amp;ret=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DHzWVzE-H1q0" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">You can have my body but you can never have me</a></em></div><div> </div><div>Taylor, you keep using this <a href="https://geotrack.email/ext/l?idx=TU2o1p3imwk4hpyvoRMe&amp;ret=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sofarfromnever.tk%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">word never </a>;

For if the owner (of the coveted object) does not wish to sell, even though he is offered a good price and is entreated to accept, the person (who covets the object) will come to steal it, as it is written (<a href="https://geotrack.email/ext/l?idx=TU2o1p3imwk4hpyvoRMe&amp;ret=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FBook_of_Micah" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Mikha</a> 2:2) [Micah 2:2], 'They covet fields and (then) steal them.'

And also:</p><blockquote><p>Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal, but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. ...
