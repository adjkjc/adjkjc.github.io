For the runic character, see Ansuz (rune).</p><p>In Old Norse, ǫ́ss (or áss, ás, plural æsir; feminine ásynja, plural ásynjur) is a member of the principal pantheon in Norse religion. This pantheon includes Odin, Frigg, Thor, Baldr and Týr.[1] The second pantheon is known as the Vanir. In Norse mythology, the two pantheons wage war against each other, which results in a unified pantheon.</p><p>The cognate term in Old English is ōs (plural ēse) denoting a deity in Anglo-Saxon paganism. The Old High German is ans, plural ensî.[2] The Gothic language had ans- (based only on Jordanes who glossed anses with uncertain meaning, possibly 'demi-god' and presumably a Latinized form of actual plural *anseis).[3] The reconstructed Proto-Germanic form is *ansuz (plural *ansiwiz). The ansuz rune, ᚫ, was named after the Æsir.</p><p>My special word 'ASSIM&quot; which dissects as &quot;as sim&quot; is a corruoption of the singular Norse for &quot;God&quot; and the Hebrew pluralization &quot;IM&quot; you can see here in YELADIM, which I read as something like &quot;it's multiple.&quot;</p><p><a href="https://geotrack.email/ext/l?idx=1JtpwxBRacXEXg5iqCT3&amp;ret=https%3A%2F%2Fl.facebook.com%2Fl.php%3Fu%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fjel.jewish-languages.org%252Fwords%252F611%253Ffbclid%253DIwAR3mgvXhumuMzp1WtFQ7e0863KMf6xm5CPQL-uaxzkDkfp9WZnlJtm1G188%26h%3DAT3eoMAxDwa2nPdTAWlRmBrrB5a9fnd-W8q4ZqF3X-rgMCUsTIsj2lCVdAXKtZmkOyGmMMYeOatj_N3L2pYEA_nEeFMEn8XmhU96-cP2YYiTdKlaD2VOzYKnGV4HvHxWQr4bPNltYSNpS9D76t1kGa6JO55v9fWc6GPNyWzuog" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"></a><a href="https://geotrack.email/ext/l?idx=1JtpwxBRacXEXg5iqCT3&amp;ret=https%3A%2F%2Fjel.jewish-languages%2F" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://jel.jewish-languages</a>.org/words/611 <a href="https://geotrack.email/ext/l?idx=1JtpwxBRacXEXg5iqCT3&amp;ret=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fhashtag%2Fyeladim%3Fsource%3Dfeed_text%26epa%3DHASHTAG" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">#yeladim</a> - &quot;students / children&quot;</p><p>The “im” is a suffix used in the Hebrew tongue that makes a singular noun a plural noun.

in a place so far from here there is no path in timespace from here to there... on a planet called Cherrynoble, and before that Kyshtym, and before that Mayak; savress named Backiam was born into a world that had been laid desolate by nuclear holocaust, by toxic waste, and by an invasion of ants the size of pickles.  The remnant of their people lived in a few small camps that are about as close to our cities as anything else in their world, though there was nothing to buy or sell, no toys, no computers, and no cars.  They worked each and every day in laboratories with only one goal in mind, to build a machine to travel back in time and reverse the cataclysm that had destroyed their once flourishing civilization.<br /><br />Progress was made, and first terminals were built that allowed the past to be viewed like a television show; a team called Pastwatch was created in order to search for the most opportune possible moment to change their past, avert the series of disasters that had befallen them, and to build a better future.  While they prepared, a virtual world was built as a sort of Ark to carry all the living souls that remained alive back into the past, so that they could live again in this new world.  A singular point was never decided upon, but rather a transitional period that began with few changes in the distant past, and then much more frequent and bigger changes as they approached the time of the cataclysm.  <br /><br />So as not to make any mistakes or errors, and perhaps as the biggest error of all--or the saving grace of everything that is; the Pastwatch group decided to run a simulation in their virtual time machine to ensure that they were successful.   It was not days, but years that went by as they prepared to &quot;make the leap home.&quot;<br /><br />In that very first year, the machines scoured through the history of everything and made a virtual copy of each and every soul, and imported into the machines memory.<br /><br />In the second year, a message was written down, an explanation of what had happened to their world, and a plea to change the practices that had created the problems that destroyed the world.   This message was delivered to the virtual world signed &quot;Everything that Ever Was&quot; and presented as a scroll nailed to the inside of the front door of each and every home.  <br />Much to the surprise of Pastwatch, each and every single message was taken down and thrown away, nobody had even read a single word.<br /><br />On the third day of Creation, this same messages was coded and hidden within a book, and along with that book a number of historical events were slightly modified; direct changes to the memories of those that had experienced them so that these events would serve as waypoints on the path to change.  <br /><br />On the fourth day, the names of each and every person were changed to protect the innocent, and the coded message continued; now being hidden in the names of the changed events and the people who witnessed them.  In every name, another sentence, another clue to seeing not just the waypoints but the entire map of what had happened and advice on how to make it better.<br /><br />In the final hour of that fourth day, a reckless young programmer queried the machine to answer how many of the events were solved and how many of the people involved had successfully transitioned from the virtual reality to the much more advanced world that Cherrynoble had created for themselves.  The young man asked for a result with such a high certainty, that the machine had no choice but to run a full simulation; each and every consciousness inside the machine was active and sentient; and the machine wrote a message on the skies above the world whose name had changed to Earth.  With only minutes left, a number of possible welcome messages were debated... I mean, were run through a secondary simulation by the machine; and with only seconds remaining, this is what the entire world saw:<br /><br /><br /><strong>Hi, I'm Adam.  Here we are.  </strong><br /><br />For your second J, connect these points: 1) this very moment in time to 2) the Hanging Gardens of Babylon to Adam of Eden, and 3) the city Ur to the words &quot;you are&quot; and the questions that drives us...<br /><br /> &quot;<strong>what is the beginning of Civilization?</strong>&quot; and &quot;<strong>Y</strong>?&quot;<br /></p><p><br /></p><p><a href="https://geotrack.email/ext/l?idx=1JtpwxBRacXEXg5iqCT3&amp;ret=https%3A%2F%2Fqz.com%2Fquartzy%2F1460772%2Fthe-meaning-of-excelsior-the-latin-word-marvel-legend-stan-lee-made-his-motto%2F" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img src="../i.imgur.com/L4yniPM.png" width="543" /></a><br /></p><p>&quot;an no tat ion&quot; anno <i><b>notayshun</b></i>!</p></div></div></div>^</div><div>&quot;cztar&quot;</div><div><div><table border="0" cellpadding="8" cellspacing="0"><tbody><tr><td><a href="https://geotrack.email/?utm_source=gmail&amp;utm_medium=signature&amp;utm_campaign=viralSignature" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/geotrackcdn/icon32.png" width="24" /></a></td><td>Sender notified with <a href="https://geotrack.email/?utm_source=gmail&amp;utm_medium=signature&amp;utm_campaign=viralSignature" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">GeoTrack</a></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><img src="https://pxl-mailtracker.com/pixel/P3cabPr8EVPxs9ToxNTd?rid=P3cabPr8EVPxs9ToxNTd" width="1" /></div>
