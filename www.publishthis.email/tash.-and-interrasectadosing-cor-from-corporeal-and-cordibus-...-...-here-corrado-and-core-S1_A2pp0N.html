Cherub<i>im </i>and seraph<i>im </i>are plurals of cherub and seraph, respectively.</p><p>I guess you are thinking about the most used <i>im</i> (ים) word in the Bible, and that would be <i>elohim</i> (אֱלֹהִים), which means gods (again, plural). The interesting thing about this word is that it is used as if it were a singular noun. This means the Hebrew Bible is grammatically incorrect. Deliberately so!</p><p>I am not an expert in ancient languages, and I would not mind being corrected. But, like many other ancient Hebrew words, elohim is based in the Canaanite language discovered at Ugarit. The supreme god of Ugarit was El. (This god is in the Bible too.) And eloh (god) and elohim (gods) seem to be derivatives of this Canaanite god.</p><p>Another consideration is that, when they wrote their Bible, the Jews made a conscious decision to make Judaism a monotheistic faith. The Jews had been worshiping several gods and goddesses since their inception a few hundred years earlier, so this was a major shift. Long-held stories involving several gods had to be adapted into the monotheistic framework. The gods of creation and the the great flood and the tower of Babel now became one god. It is my contention that the reason for the singular elohim and the occasional plural rendition of the god of the Bible is a result of such adaptations.</p></div></div><div><div>529 views · <a href="https://geotrack.email/ext/l?idx=Js1qF9v5y3wKTeE7wVgw&amp;ret=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.quora.com%2FWhat-does-the-im-suffix-mean-at-the-end-of-a-biblical-name%23" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">View Upvoters</a></div></div><div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div></div></div></div></div></div><div><a href="https://geotrack.email/ext/l?idx=Js1qF9v5y3wKTeE7wVgw&amp;ret=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.quora.com%2FWhat-does-the-im-suffix-mean-at-the-end-of-a-biblical-name%23" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><div><div><div></div></div><div>Upvote· 23</div></div></a><div><div><a href="https://geotrack.email/ext/l?idx=Js1qF9v5y3wKTeE7wVgw&amp;ret=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.quora.com%2FWhat-does-the-im-suffix-mean-at-the-end-of-a-biblical-name%23" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><div><div><div></div></div><div>Share</div></div></a><div></div></div></div><div><a href="https://geotrack.email/ext/l?idx=Js1qF9v5y3wKTeE7wVgw&amp;ret=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.quora.com%2FWhat-does-the-im-suffix-mean-at-the-end-of-a-biblical-name%23" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><div><div><div></div></div></div></a></div><div><div><div><a href="https://geotrack.email/ext/l?idx=Js1qF9v5y3wKTeE7wVgw&amp;ret=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.quora.com%2FWhat-does-the-im-suffix-mean-at-the-end-of-a-biblical-name%23" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><div><div><div></div></div></div></a></div></div></div><div></div><div><div><a href="https://geotrack.email/ext/l?idx=Js1qF9v5y3wKTeE7wVgw&amp;ret=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.quora.com%2FWhat-does-the-im-suffix-mean-at-the-end-of-a-biblical-name%23" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><div><div><div></div></div></div></a></div></div></div></div></div><div><div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><a href="https://geotrack.email/ext/l?idx=Js1qF9v5y3wKTeE7wVgw&amp;ret=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.quora.com%2Fprofile%2FAdam-Marshall-Dobrin-1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://d2o7bfz2il9cb7.cloudfront.net/main-thumb-71460998-100-fdkcnosvribzjnqdqgnrrewqbiqoeviy.jpeg" /></a></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><br /></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><a href="https://geotrack.email/ext/l?idx=Js1qF9v5y3wKTeE7wVgw&amp;ret=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.quora.com%2FWhat-does-the-im-suffix-mean-at-the-end-of-a-biblical-name%23" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Recommended</a><a href="https://geotrack.email/ext/l?idx=Js1qF9v5y3wKTeE7wVgw&amp;ret=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.quora.com%2FWhat-does-the-im-suffix-mean-at-the-end-of-a-biblical-name%23" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">All</a></div></div><div><div><div></div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><a href="https://geotrack.email/ext/l?idx=Js1qF9v5y3wKTeE7wVgw&amp;ret=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.quora.com%2Fprofile%2FAdam-Marshall-Dobrin-1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://d2o7bfz2il9cb7.cloudfront.net/main-thumb-71460998-100-fdkcnosvribzjnqdqgnrrewqbiqoeviy.jpeg" /></a></div></div></div><div><a href="https://geotrack.email/ext/l?idx=Js1qF9v5y3wKTeE7wVgw&amp;ret=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.quora.com%2Fprofile%2FAdam-Marshall-Dobrin-1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Adam Marshall Dobrin</a><div><a href="https://geotrack.email/ext/l?idx=Js1qF9v5y3wKTeE7wVgw&amp;ret=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.quora.com%2FWhat-does-the-im-suffix-mean-at-the-end-of-a-biblical-name%2Fanswer%2FCharles-Fiott%2Fcomment%2F98031532" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">4m ago</a></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><p>Elohim is something like “Allah” where you might see “all” and think plural.

A trivial semaphore is a plain variable that is changed (for example, incremented or decremented, or toggled) depending on programmer-defined conditions.</p><p>A useful way to think of a semaphore as used in the real-world system is as a record of how many units of a particular resource are available, coupled with operations to adjust that record <i>safely</i> (i.e. to avoid <a href="https://geotrack.email/ext/l?idx=Js1qF9v5y3wKTeE7wVgw&amp;ret=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FRace_condition" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">race conditions</a>) as units are required or become free, and, if necessary, wait until a unit of the resource becomes available.</p><p>Semaphores are a useful tool in the prevention of race conditions; however, their use is by no means a guarantee that a program is free from these problems. Semaphores which allow an arbitrary resource count are called <b>counting semaphores</b>, while semaphores which are restricted to the values 0 and 1 (or locked/unlocked, unavailable/available) are called <b>binary semaphores</b> and are used to implement <a href="https://geotrack.email/ext/l?idx=Js1qF9v5y3wKTeE7wVgw&amp;ret=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FLock_(computer_science)" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">locks</a>.</p><p>The semaphore concept was invented by <a href="https://geotrack.email/ext/l?idx=Js1qF9v5y3wKTeE7wVgw&amp;ret=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FDutch_people" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Dutch</a> <a href="https://geotrack.email/ext/l?idx=Js1qF9v5y3wKTeE7wVgw&amp;ret=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FComputer_scientist" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">computer scientist</a> <a href="https://geotrack.email/ext/l?idx=Js1qF9v5y3wKTeE7wVgw&amp;ret=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FEdsger_Dijkstra" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Edsger Dijkstra</a> in 1962 or 1963,<a href="https://geotrack.email/ext/l?idx=Js1qF9v5y3wKTeE7wVgw&amp;ret=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FSemaphore_(programming)%23cite_note-ReferenceA-1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">[1]</a> when Dijkstra and his team were developing an <a href="https://geotrack.email/ext/l?idx=Js1qF9v5y3wKTeE7wVgw&amp;ret=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FOperating_system" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">operating system</a> for the <a href="https://geotrack.email/ext/l?idx=Js1qF9v5y3wKTeE7wVgw&amp;ret=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FElectrologica_X8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Electrologica X8</a>.

Students must request a room from the front desk if they wish to use a study room. If no rooms are free, students wait at the desk until someone relinquishes a room. When a student has finished using a room, the student must return to the desk and indicate that one room has become free.</p><p>In the simplest implementation, the clerk at the front desk knows only the number of free rooms available, which they only know correctly if all of the students actually use their room while they've signed up for them and return them when they're done. When a student requests a room, the clerk decreases this number. When a student releases a room, the clerk increases this number. The room can be used for as long as desired, and so it is not possible to book rooms ahead of time.</p><p>In this scenario the front desk count-holder represents a counting semaphore, the rooms are the resource, and the students represent processes/threads. The value of the semaphore in this scenario is initially 10, with all rooms empty. When a student requests a room, they are granted access, and the value of the semaphore is changed to 9. After the next student comes, it drops to 8, then 7 and so on. If someone requests a room and the current value of the semaphore is 0,<a href="https://geotrack.email/ext/l?idx=Js1qF9v5y3wKTeE7wVgw&amp;ret=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FSemaphore_(programming)%23cite_note-2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">[2]</a> they are forced to wait until a room is freed (when the count is increased from 0). If one of the rooms was released, but there are several students waiting, then any method can be used to select the one who will occupy the room (like <a href="https://geotrack.email/ext/l?idx=Js1qF9v5y3wKTeE7wVgw&amp;ret=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FFIFO_(computing_and_electronics)" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">FIFO</a> or flipping a coin). And of course, a student needs to inform the clerk about releasing their room only after really leaving it, otherwise, there can be an awkward situation when such student is in the process of leaving the room (they are packing their textbooks, etc.) and another student enters the room before they leave it.</p><h3>Important observations[<a href="https://geotrack.email/ext/l?idx=Js1qF9v5y3wKTeE7wVgw&amp;ret=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fw%2Findex.php%3Ftitle%3DSemaphore_(programming)%26action%3Dedit%26section%3D2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">edit</a>]</h3><p>When used to control access to a <a href="https://geotrack.email/ext/l?idx=Js1qF9v5y3wKTeE7wVgw&amp;ret=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FPool_(computer_science)" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">pool</a> of resources, a semaphore tracks only <i>how many</i> resources are free; it does not keep track of <i>which</i> of the resources are free. Some other mechanism (possibly involving more semaphores) may be required to select a particular free resource.</p><p>The paradigm is especially powerful because the semaphore count may serve as a useful trigger for a number of different actions. The librarian above may turn the lights off in the study hall when there are no students remaining, or may place a sign that says the rooms are very busy when most of the rooms are occupied.</p><p>The success of the protocol requires applications to follow it correctly. Fairness and safety are likely to be compromised (which practically means a program may behave slowly, act erratically, <a href="https://geotrack.email/ext/l?idx=Js1qF9v5y3wKTeE7wVgw&amp;ret=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FHang_(computing)" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">hang</a> or <a href="https://geotrack.email/ext/l?idx=Js1qF9v5y3wKTeE7wVgw&amp;ret=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FCrash_(computing)" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">crash</a>) if even a single process acts incorrectly.

The P operation <a href="https://geotrack.email/ext/l?idx=Js1qF9v5y3wKTeE7wVgw&amp;ret=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FBusy_waiting" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">wastes time</a> or <a href="https://geotrack.email/ext/l?idx=Js1qF9v5y3wKTeE7wVgw&amp;ret=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FSleep_(system_call)" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">sleeps</a> until a resource protected by the semaphore becomes available, at which time the resource is immediately claimed. The V operation is the inverse: it makes a resource available again after the process has finished using it. One important property of semaphore <i>S</i> is that its value cannot be changed except by using the V and P operations.</p><p>A simple way to understand wait (P) and signal (V) operations is:</p><ul><li>wait: Decrements the value of semaphore variable by 1. If the new value of the semaphore variable is negative, the process executing wait is blocked (i.e., added to the semaphore's queue). Otherwise, the process continues execution, having used a unit of the resource.</li><li>signal: Increments the value of semaphore variable by 1. After the increment, if the pre-increment value was negative (meaning there are processes waiting for a resource), it transfers a blocked process from the semaphore's waiting queue to the ready queue.</li></ul><p>Many operating systems provide efficient semaphore primitives that unblock a waiting process when the semaphore is incremented. This means that processes do not waste time checking the semaphore value unnecessarily.</p><p>The counting semaphore concept can be extended with the ability to claim or return more than one &quot;unit&quot; from the semaphore, a technique implemented in <a href="https://geotrack.email/ext/l?idx=Js1qF9v5y3wKTeE7wVgw&amp;ret=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FUnix" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Unix</a>. The modified V and P operations are as follows, using square brackets to indicate <a href="https://geotrack.email/ext/l?idx=Js1qF9v5y3wKTeE7wVgw&amp;ret=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FAtomic_operation" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">atomic operations</a>, i.e., operations which appear indivisible from the perspective of other processes:</p><b>function</b> V(semaphore S, integer I):
[S ← S + I]
<b>function</b> P(semaphore S, integer I):

[<b>if</b> S ≥ I:
S ← S − I
<b>break</b>]

If a process performs a P operation on a semaphore that has the value zero, the process is added to the semaphore's queue and its execution is suspended. When another process increments the semaphore by performing a V operation, and there are processes on the queue, one of them is removed from the queue and resumes execution. When processes have different priorities the queue may be ordered by priority, so that the highest priority process is taken from the queue first.</p><p>If the implementation does not ensure atomicity of the increment, decrement and comparison operations, then there is a risk of increments or decrements being forgotten, or of the semaphore value becoming negative. Atomicity may be achieved by using a machine instruction that is able to <a href="https://geotrack.email/ext/l?idx=Js1qF9v5y3wKTeE7wVgw&amp;ret=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FRead-modify-write" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">read, modify and write</a> the semaphore in a single operation.
