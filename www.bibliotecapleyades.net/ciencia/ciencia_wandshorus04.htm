			It is necessary to understand the purpose of the Pharaohs and 
			Priests in ancient Egypt. This was to maintain the communicating 
			link between the divine teachers and the men of earth and attempt to 
			curb the downward rush toward materialism by guiding man in his 
			spiritual development and ultimately break the cycle and curse of 
			reincarnation.<br>
			<br>
			The Pyramid complex of Egypt was built as a House of Initiation 
			where neophytes could pass the various stages of initiation under 
			the auspices of a Ritual Priest. <br>
			<br>
			To be equipped to undertake this task it is necessary to maintain 
			all aspects of the human body in optimum condition, purified of all 
			physical imperfections and particularly develop the psychic 
			abilities. This allowed the person to see ahead, enable them to 
			seize the opportunities of carrying out the designs which the both 
			the soul desired to carry through a particular life, and to assist 
			in the overall development and guidance of mankind. <br>
			<br>
			To communicate with the divine teachers, it was necessary to 
			understand the inner planes and be able to navigate these without 
			coming under the influence of the various entities which prey on the 
			lower astral levels and seek to trick the inexperienced and week.
			<br>
			<br>
			All those who had a material part in the ruling of the land had to 
			show themselves worthy before they could fill an office, by passing 
			through the required stages of initiation, involving many tests of 
			endurance and sincerity. In this way the foundations of the ancient 
			empires were kept firmly rooted and the process of mans spiritual 
			development could be fostered. </font></p>

			Pyramids, which have long troubled human imagination, were 
			<a target="_blank" href="https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_piramides_mundo.htm">
			<font color="#0000DD">constructed in various parts of the globe</font></a>, forming systems of their 
			own, but we shall begin our account with an examination of the 
			immense complex of the Great Pyramids located outside Giza in Egypt.
			<br>
			<br>
			Of itself the pyramid, its shape and configuration, is an extremely 
			strange structure, while the curious phenomena that have been 
			observed in the chambers of the pyramids suggest that some kind of 
			energy processes are taking place there. Today our task is to try to 
			understand the principles lying behind those processes. <br>
			<br>
			You have probably already heard that there are certain places within 
			the pyramid where foodstuffs of biological origin will keep for an 
			indefinite length of time. There are also chambers where, if someone 
			remains for an extended period, they experience an incredible sense 
			of disquiet. <br>
			<br>
			However, there are also areas which engender feelings of a different 
			kind: positive, stimulating creative activity, and fostering 
			intuition. <br>
			<br>
			The pyramids pose a host of puzzles, one of which is why they were 
			built. We were taught to regard them as the tombs of pharaohs, but 
			still today the actual burial-place has not been discovered in a 
			single pyramid. It is just not there. The question then arises: for 
			what purpose were such gigantic constructions put up, if not to 
			glorify the pharaoh as God's representative on Earth? <br>
			<br>
			In order to answer that question we should begin with an examination 
			of the principles lying behind the idea of constructing the 
			pyramids. 
			The key to understanding the laws that formed the basis for the 
			construction of the pyramids is provided by the tablets on which, 
			according to legend, the Ancient Egyptians expounded their 
			knowledge.

			<font color="#0000DD">Several 
			layers of information can be traced on them</font></a>, providing the key to 
			recognition of the fact that the Ancient Egyptians knew all about 
			the <u>Golden Section</u> <b>long before Pythagoras</b>. <br>
			<br>
			The Golden Section is a well-known numerical ratio. If the sides of 
			a rectangle have this ratio, it means that the smaller is to the 
			larger as the larger is to the sum of both. Numerically it is 
			approx. <b>1.618034</b>, or it's inverse 0.618034. Note the exact 
			difference of 1 between these two numbers! It can also be defined as 
			the solution to the quadratic equation x2 - x - 1 = 0. <br>
			<br>
			Today we know from measurements that have been taken that the 
			principle of the Golden Section was used in the construction of all 
			the great pyramids. </font></p>
			<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left:6px; margin-right:2px">
			&nbsp;</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left:6px; margin-right:2px">
			<font face="Arial" size="2">Another question arises. It is not easy 
			to produce a structure like a pyramid, you need to have the 
			appropriate constructional technology suited to the purpose, but 
			beyond that its geometrical structure incorporates the irrational 
			ratios of the Golden Section, which are more difficult than ordinary 
			whole numbers. Why? <br>
			<br>
			It should be pointed out that the whole musical scale, the whole 
			sonic temperament, obeys the same <u>law of the Golden Section</u>. <br>
			<br>
			Remember what it says in the Gospel: &quot;In the beginning was the Word&quot; 
			- and the word is sound (a wave process characterized by frequency). 
			And if the word conveys meaning, Wood panel carved in then that means 
			that the raised relief from the tomb frequency, as a of <u>Hesy-ra at 
			Saqqara</u> in characteristic of the <b>energy</b> the Third Dynasty process 
			should also have some kind of meaning. </font></p>
			<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left:6px; margin-right:2px">
			&nbsp;</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left:6px; margin-right:2px">
			<font face="Arial" size="2">The one cannot exist without 
			the other. That is a principle. The conclusion follows that the 
			principle of the Golden Section, upon which the great multitude of 
			objects in the biological world are constructed, bears a very 
			profound, fundamental meaning. And it is no coincidence that in the 
			human being in particular the law of the Golden Section can be 
			traced in some many different variations that one can only wonder 
			that nature created us just that way. </font></p>
			<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left:6px; margin-right:2px">
			&nbsp;</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left:6px; margin-right:2px">
			<font face="Arial" size="2">The <b>bones of the fingers</b>, <u>three in 
			number</u>; three parts of the arm (the relationship of lengths) - elements of the Golden Section. The heart beats in this rhythm and 
			pushes blood into the aorta, leaving a portion in the ventricle. </font></p>
			<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left:6px; margin-right:2px">
			&nbsp;</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left:6px; margin-right:2px">
			<font face="Arial" size="2">All 
			of it the <b>Golden Section</b>. The rods and cones of the eye, the cochlea 
			of the ear (the ratio of the lengths of the spirals), the structure 
			of the whole skeletal framework - examine the statistical averages 
			and it is all the Golden Section. Even the dynamics of the neural 
			structures in certain mental states obey the same law. <br>
			<br>
			Can that really be mere chance or a peculiarity of mankind alone? 
			No, the same principle governs the <u>orbital periods of the planets in 
			the Solar System</u>, the musical scale is founded on it, the system of 
			chemical elements and indeed everything connected with natural 
			systems obeys that law. <br>
			<br>
			You get the feeling that human beings were created to some kind of 
			standard. It would be more correct, however, to say that human 
			beings could not have formed differently for the simple reason that 
			they appeared in an environment that imposes those parameters, and 
			the values of the Golden Section bear a direct relation to what we 
			call &quot;<b>harmonic resonance</b>&quot;. <br>
			<br>
			The actual idea of using the Golden Section in architecture today, 
			together with the creation of &quot;complexes of pyramidal energy 
			structures&quot;, is the chief element in solving the problems of the 
			ecology of housing, the ecology of the mental environment, and in 
			the process of coming to an understanding of the world. </font></p>

			<font face="Arial" size="2">Men have been searching for that 
			knowledge for many centuries already. They looked for it within the 
			twin-humped rock on which the body of the pyramid rests. They also 
			looked for beneath the pyramid. But the room is not where they were 
			looking but in the upper part of the pyramid, at a point defined by 
			the ratio 0.118:0.882. That chamber contains the &quot;<b>Energy Source</b>&quot; which the Ancient Egyptians inherited from the 
			people of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_atlantida.htm">
			<font color="#0000DD">Atlantis</font></a> who had come to northern Africa long before the 
			heyday of Egyptian civilization. <br>
			<br>
			<b>This source takes the form of a cylinder</b> within which is a 
			special crystal with a lattice structure close in parameters to that 
			of quartz crystals. Almost all the most astonishing phenomena 
			observed in and around the pyramid are connected with the presence 
			of this very device. The sense of creating and using the &quot;<u>Energy Source</u>&quot; 
			lies in its capacity to affect the structure of time and space in 
			the vicinity of its location. </font></p>
			<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left:6px; margin-right:2px">

			<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left:6px; margin-right:2px">
			<font face="Arial" size="2">The shape of the pyramid serves to 
			intensify this effect and disperses the incoming energy in the area 
			of the pyramid. Besides that, though, the &quot;Energy Source&quot; affects 
			human psychological and physical structure. <br>
			<br>
			<img border="0" src="https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/imagenes_ciencia/wandshorus_book_img_22a.jpg" width="300" height="218" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="15">In the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/esp_piramide.htm">
			<font color="#0000DD">Pyramid of Cheops</font></a> there is a chamber, 
			<b>erroneously referred</b> to by the majority of Egyptologists as 
			the &quot;<i>Queen's burial chamber</i>&quot;, 
			whose situation in respect of the summit of the pyramid is connected 
			with the tuning frequency. If we take the height of the whole 
			pyramid as one unit, and measure down a distance of 0.882 - twice 
			the frequency of A (or rather an octave higher), we find the chamber 
			at <u>exactly that point</u>. </font></p>

			<font face="Arial" size="2">But if we remember that the average human 
			ear, indeed the whole structure of the human being, is attuned to 
			the frequency of A, forming a kind of planetary field of this 
			keynote signal, it emerges that the chamber within the pyramid is 
			placed at a position attuned to the resonating frequency of that 
			field. <br>
			<br>
			If, 
			proceeding from that, we accept that the pyramid works as a 
			<b>resonator</b>, then we can begin to think of the purpose of pyramid as 
			taking the form of a special kind of generator. Then the reason for 
			the appearance of resonance characteristics and energy phenomena at 
			various points in the pyramid becomes clear. <br>
			<br>
			In order to better picture the mechanisms operating in the great 
			pyramid complex at Giza, let us examine an easily understood 
			example. Take two guitars and tune them in unison. </font></p>
			<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left:6px; margin-right:2px">
			&nbsp;</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left:6px; margin-right:2px">
			<font face="Arial" size="2">Then put one of 
			the guitars in the next room, come back, pick up the other and 
			strike a note - on the sixth, thickest string, say. If you do that, 
			you will observe that the sixth string of the second guitar, 
			standing in the corner of the other room, has also begun to vibrate, 
			producing a barely audible note, although you have not touched it. 
			That is the physical phenomenon of harmonic resonance in action. <br>
			<br>
			As has already been stated, the pyramid, being at one and the same 
			time both an antenna and a resonator, is a retransmitter of certain 
			energy flows connected with processes taking place in the cosmos, 
			flows that are in turn focused on the &quot;Energy Source&quot; within the 
			pyramid. </font></p>

			<font face="Arial" size="2">The Wands of Horus that the priests and pharaohs used, the 
			concentrators worn on the head, the &quot;Energy Source&quot; within the 
			pyramid, the pyramids themselves and much else besides was created 
			in accordance with the proportions of the Golden Section, which was 
			the precondition for all the objects being attuned to one another 
			(in unison, as it were). It should be remembered that all the 
			physical and energy structures of the human being are subject to the 
			laws of the Golden Section. <br>
			<br>
			Consequently, everything made by nature or constructed by mankind in 
			accordance with that principle is &quot;attuned&quot; to everything else. 
			Therefore when the energy flow acts on the &quot;Energy Source&quot; inside 
			the pyramid, the structure of the pyramid amplifies that effect. <br>
			<br>
			The effect extends not only to people and objects located inside the 
			pyramid. It extends over a very large area beyond as a result of 
			which cylinders being held in the hands begin to &quot;ring&quot;, or resonate 
			like the sixth string of the guitar in the next room. In this way 
			the energy is transmitted over a distance and the energy reaching 
			the &quot;Energy Source&quot; in the pyramid is transferred to people and to 
			the cylinders in their hands. <br>

			whole complex - the energy source within the pyramid, the cylinders 
			held in the hands, and the concentrator (on the pharaoh's head) - is 
			directly connected on certain days (cycles) of the year with the 
			pyramids and their effect. <br>
			<br>
			The pyramid, being simultaneously both antenna and resonator, is a 
			retransmitter of certain energy flows arising from processes taking 
			place in the cosmos, flows that are in turn focused on the &quot;Energy 
			Source&quot; inside the pyramid. The influence of this complex and its 
			correct interaction with human consciousness produced the effect of 
			&quot;Intercourse with the Gods&quot;. <br>

			shall therefore try to explain in more basic terms that nonetheless 
			convey fairly accurately the main idea of the process. <br>
			<br>
			People who seek after knowledge are familiar with the concept of 
			energy shells that, according to a certain Eastern tradition, make 
			up the energy structure of the human being. We know about the 
			existence of the ethereal body, the astral body, the mental body and 
			so on, up to the seventh energy body. But there is evidence that the 
			ancient hierophants knew of the existence of several more energy 
			bodies or shells, of which the present-day esoteric and other

			<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left:6px; margin-right:2px">

			<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left:6px; margin-right:2px">
			<font face="Arial" size="2">The final energy body, still unknown to 
			humanity today, is the shell through which each person has direct 
			contact with what people call &quot;<i>God</i>&quot; or the &quot;Source&quot; of everything, 
			all knowledge and energy. Through that shell we have a link to all 
			the world around us, as we are part of the Great Creative Principle. 
			Since we possess that shell, we are ourselves in a way sources of 
			energy. <br>
			<br>
			Let us examine the human energy structure from viewpoints more 
			accessible to the present-day reader. <br>
			<br>
			What people commonly call the &quot;aura&quot; or &quot;biological field&quot; is the 
			consequence of the interaction of the vibrations of various energy 
			layers (bodies) within the human energy system. <br>
			<br>
			The existing names of the energy bodies in any of the familiar 
			traditions is nothing more than an agreed convention. Therefore, for 
			the convenience and ease of understanding particularly of a reader 
			unfamiliar with &quot;<i>esoteric</i>&quot; doctrines, we shall call the first 
			energy body &quot;ethereal&quot;, the second &quot;astral&quot;, the third &quot;mental&quot;, and so on.
			<br>
			<br>
			The human energy system consists of several energy bodies (levels), 
			that differ in shape, energy density, and vibratory rhythm 
			(frequency). Most importantly, though, they have different 
			characteristics. <br>

			<font face="Arial" size="2">In examining the effect of the Wands of 
			Horus on the human organism, we shall stick to the first two 
			structures that are responsible directly for a person's 
			bio-energetic rhythm and emotional state. <br>
			<br>
			The first energy body consists of vibrations and temperature rhythms 
			in the person's physical structure. Therefore any process taking 
			place in the physical body is immediately reflected in the first 
			energy body. <br>
			<br>
			For example, an inflammatory process has begun localized in the 
			small of the back (lumbago). That is followed by oedema and an 
			increase in temperature that immediately finds reflection in the 
			altered shape and vibratory frequency of the corresponding part of 
			the first energy body. Hence, influencing that 
			part of the energy body and correcting the vibratory frequency leads 
			to a reduction in the pain syndrome. <br>
			<br>
			The lines of the first energy body precisely follow those of the 
			physical body, forming an energy layer between 0.3 and 2–3 meters 
			thick. The first energy body is the receptor and distributor of 
			transformed cosmic energy - prana. It is through this body that our 
			physical body becomes charged with the vital energy our organism 
			needs <br>
			<br>
			The second, astral energy body is responsible for our emotional 
			state and any nervous or psychological stress evokes changes in this 
			body. <br>
			<br>
			The upsurge of emotions in stress leads to the destabilization of 
			the structure of the second energy body producing changes that 
			subsequently lead to discomfort and neuro-psychological problems.
			<br>
			<br>
			The human energy system has centers, known as chakras, through which 
			the organism interacts with the outside world. <br>
			<br>
			We can picture a chakra as a sort of energy vortex (or funnel). The 
			transformed energy of the cosmos, the earth, water, sunlight enters 
			the physical body through the chakras. The chakras, being the 
			immediate conductors of energy that has been processed in the energy 
			system pass it on to the person's endocrine system. All the chakras 
			are connected to our physical body and are sort of projections of 
			the endocrine system. <br>
			<br>
			The main energy centers, while being projections of the endocrine 
			system, also have their own projections. The first chakra has 
			projections on the feet; the seventh chakra on the palms. </font></p>

					<font face="Arial" size="2">As the cylinders absorb warmth from the hands, the crystals of

			<br>
			The essence of this phenomenon that is observed is that at the 
			moment when the Wands of Horus, interacting with processes within 
			the organism (against the background of the polarization process), 
			attunes itself to the holder, the organism itself sets the 
			vibration, the rhythm that it requires at that particular time. The

			<font face="Arial" size="2">But there 
			was more to the work than just that. In order to prepare for work 
			within the pyramid and to gain the capacity to foresee the future, 
			you need energy. Therefore the pharaoh and the hierophants tried not 
			to squander the energy received, storing it up, leading an 
			appropriate lifestyle and bringing their abilities up to the 
			necessary level. <br>
			<br>
			The third, &quot;mental&quot; energy body is connected with what people 
			associate with the concept of the &quot;soul&quot; (a person's psychological 
			condition). Harmonization of this energy body with the aid of the 
			Wands of Horus creates the preconditions necessary for the stabilization and development of mental capacities. <br>
			<br>
			The basic sequence by which the Wands of Horus work is as follows:
			</font></p>
			<blockquote>
				<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left:6px; margin-right:2px">
				<font face="Arial" size="2">By galvanic and piezo-electric effects 
			(raising the energy level of the crystals in the filling) 
			stimulating the 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> energy centers, the 
			Wands of Horus act 
			on the central nervous system. From the central nervous system an 
			impulse passes to the hypothalamus, from the hypothalamus to the 
			hypophysis. Then on to the endocrine system (the secretionary 
			glands), then to the organs. </font></p>
			</blockquote>
			<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left:6px; margin-right:2px">
			<font face="Arial" size="2">The reverse reaction flows along two 
			paths: </font></p>
			<blockquote>
				<ul>
					<li>
					<p style="margin-top: 2px; margin-bottom: 2px; margin-left:6px; margin-right:2px">
					<font face="Arial" size="2">From the 
									endocrine system to the central nervous 
									system </font></p></li>
					<li>
					<p style="margin-top: 2px; margin-bottom: 2px; margin-left:6px; margin-right:2px">
					<font face="Arial" size="2">Through the 
									state of the organs to the central nervous
									</font></p></li>
				</ul>
			</blockquote>
			<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left:6px; margin-right:2px">
			<font face="Arial" size="2">Thus information about the state of the 
			secretionary organs and disorders of the internal organs is passed 
			from the endocrine system and the organs to the central nervous 
			system. </font></p>
			<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left:6px; margin-right:2px">
			&nbsp;</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left:6px; margin-right:2px">
			<font face="Arial" size="2">When it gets this information, the central nervous system 
			directs the signals to the hypothalamus and hypophysis that in turn 
			activate the functions of self-healing and regeneration, if those 
			functions are in order and not hampered by, among other things, 
			significant &quot;furring&quot; of the relevant energy canals. In the event of 
			inadequate functioning of the energy canals, the energy cocoon 
			generated by the Wands of Horus vibrating at the frequency dictated 
			by the hypothalamus and hypophysis assumes an intermediary role 
			conveying the blocked signal and stimulating the functions of 
			self-healing and regeneration. <br>
			<br>
			The &quot;pranic cocoon&quot; produced by the Wands of HorusKont (carbon and 
			ferro-magnetic) has a powerful impulse effect on the human organism, 
			but it is not stable. Irrespective of how long you work with this 
			type of cylinder, even two or three days, the cocoon they create

			<br>
			The Wands of HorusQuartz, filled with crystals of quartz, produce a 
			&quot;pranic cocoon&quot; that has a gentle, even, but deepacting effect on 
			the human organism. The cocoon created by this type of cylinder is 
			very stable. If you work with the Wands of HorusQuartz continuously 
			for a week, then the cocoon they create will last for three weeks, 
			continuing its corrective effect on the whole organism. <br>
			<br>
			To correct pathological conditions that have built up over a number 
			of years, the organism and the Wands of Horus need time. Therefore 
			work with the cylinders must be regular and continuous. The deep 
			correction required for serious conditions may take several months.

			<br>
			During the experiment with the Wands of Horus Quartz

			a special, more harmonious state in which the user will receive a 
			more profound positive effect. <br>
			<br>
			The stability of the effect obtained from working with the cylinders

			<font face="Arial" size="2">The decisive factor in choosing

			influence of the pyramid the crystal lattice of the quartz changed 
			its qualities, becoming more regular, flawless, and consequently

			<br>
			In the subsequent stages of the process of self-perfection, special 
			crystals were placed inside the Wands of Horus. Their more perfect

			of its structuring fields. <br>
			<br>
			It is important to note that the orientation of the crystals of the

			of no relevance with regard to the law of harmonic resonance. In 
			this instance the significant thing is not the shape or orientation 
			of each individual grain, but the peculiarities of the crystal 
			lattice. <br>
			<br>
			It should be stressed that when choosing the fillings for the 
			cylinders it is not absolutely correct to divide them into Yin and 
			Yang, or to associate the qualities of the fillings with the 
			horoscope. This connection is a very conditional one. <br>
			<br>
			To better understand the essence of the process, one should bear in

			<br>
			<b>Why Quartz? <br>
			</b>The history of quartz goes back far further than that of 
			diamonds and other precious stones. The legendary civilization of Atlantis was already aware of the hidden power and colossal energy 
			of quartz crystals. Legends and popular beliefs about quartz that 
			survive in Tibet inform us of the extensive use in Atlantis of rock 
			crystal (transparent quartz) ranging from healing to telepathic 
			communication and tapping the energy of the Cosmos. Those legends 
			speak of the Atlanteans having gigantic pyramids, colossal 
			energy-stores. The summits of many pyramids were crowned with large 
			crystals of quartz. <br>
			<br>
			Much of the Atlanteans' knowledge disappeared, but some survived to 
			put out shoots in other cultures - in Egypt, Tibet and India. <br>
			<br>
			For many ancient civilizations quartz was a sacred mineral. The 
			Ancients believed that quartz was the very consummation of nature, 
			and its structure the basis of life on Earth. Indian yogis hold that 
			quartz and the human being represent the culmination of evolution in 
			the universe. Perhaps this is because of all the mineral kingdom 
			quartz is most in tune with the human being. The Ancients believed 
			that crystals of quartz radiate a divine white light, that they are 
			the key giving entry to cosmic harmony, putting a person in touch 
			with its vibrations. They are conductors of the pure energy of the 
			cosmos, high frequency generators. Crystals are akin to the pyramids 
			that connect people to the cosmic consciousness. <br>
			<br>
			One of the basic concepts in crystallography is the axis of symmetry 
			of a crystal. If you take a quartz crystal with well developed 
			facets, then from the position of those facets it is possible to 
			observe one peculiar fact: the vertical axis of symmetry in a quartz 
			crystal is twisted in a spiral. </font></p>

			<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left:6px; margin-right:2px">
			<font face="Arial" size="2">To explain one further significant 
			peculiarity of quartz we need to turn once again to the conceptual 
			system of the Ancient East. <br>
			<br>
			The quartz crystal, like any other, has its energy centre (chakra). 
			However, because in quartz the axis of symmetry forms a spiral, 
			several projections of the main energy centre form within the 
			crystal. That is to say one centre receives energy, but several give 
			it out. You can picture it more precisely in this way: one zone of 
			the crystal accumulates energy within itself, transforms and 
			scatters it. </font></p>
			<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left:6px; margin-right:2px">
			&nbsp;</p>
			<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: 0; margin-left:6px; margin-right:2px">
			<font face="Arial" size="2">What was one flow becomes several. Precisely due to the helical structure and, as a consequence, this scattering effect, 
			Wands of Horus filled with quartz crystals have a gentle, general 
			healing effect on a person's energo-informational structure and his 
			or her entire organism. <br>
			<br>
			Perhaps it was for this very reason that some ancient civilizations 
			considered quartz a sacred mineral. It was evidently also connected 
			with quartz's ability to convey information. </font></p>

			<font face="Arial" size="2">In this context it is
