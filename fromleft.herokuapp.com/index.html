<p>Over the course of the last half decade I&apos;ve delivered what I believe is a clear map to God&apos;s plan for Creation--linking verifiable scientific proof that our civilization is not only &quot;created by an outside entity&quot; but that ever single word of every language, every letter, and a significant amount of worldly history, structures, and art are the literal answer to the question &quot;What is the Matrix?&quot;</p>
<p>The purpose of this event is to revitalize the democratic process and to integrate modern technology into not only the existing laws but into the legislative process in general.   We need to amend the Constitution to account for the great leaps in communications technology, as well as the &quot;truth disclosed&quot; through religion--that we are not living in reality but are rather living inside a virtual world--in the words of the Lord&apos;s Prayer, &quot;that the Earth is in Heaven.&quot;</p>
<p>The proof of Creation that I am disclosing is literally &quot;within the structure of every single word and every single letter&quot; connecting &quot;engineered language&quot; to the Obelisk of the letter &quot;L&quot; within the word &quot;English.&quot;  This is plain English, it is a statistically provable and verifiable truth that these letters and words show a massive amount of direction from an intelligence outside of us; and outside this world.  It proves that &quot;Heaven&quot; does indeed exist, though as we look around at the problems that have been laid before us ... in the words of Goo Goo Dolls&apos; &quot;Iris&quot; ... everything has been made broken--I just want you to realize, it&apos;s so that &quot;<a href="http://fromleft.herokuapp.com/GATE" class="is-internal-link is-valid-page">you and I</a>&quot; can put the pieces together &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsvzPif9IEg" class="is-external-link">our way</a>.&quot;<br>

<p>I&apos;ve sent what amounts to three separate email campaigns in order to allow this disclosure to &quot;safely and slowly/quickly&quot; assimilate into our society; though as I look around today, it&apos;s fairly obvious that neither you nor I should be happy with the state of this disclosure.  It needs to change the world.  We need to change our understanding of the First and Fourth amendments to create a world and system that protects communication, children, and nearly everyone from harm.  I think we have the outline already before us; connecting A Scanner Darkly and Minority Report to Senator Ron Wyden&apos;s statement: &quot;many Americans [know] that we can have both total privacy and total security.&quot;</p>
<p>It&apos;s as simple as acknowledging the truth--that in virtual reality bullets can be stopped by Keanu&apos;s hand ... in mid air, before hitting innocent targets; and again through his hand our privacy can be protected even from the government using a sort of &quot;logical reversal&quot; of the anonymization suit Phillip K. Dick wrote about.  The Patriot Act needs to go--the NSA has the ability today to halt nearly all crimes of violence, and we need a legislative process that uses this to .... for the most part end our criminal court system.</p>

<p>I shouldn&apos;t have had to start this message talking about violence and an obvious solution to it--and that&apos;s crux of the problem with the Universe today; we truly need to see the morality and the humanity of our idea &quot;humane&quot; create a basis for &quot;law&quot; and a foundation for the new order of the ages--one that will never again allow the de4scent of civilization to the current state of slavery and stupidity that defines this era, &quot;the Vulgar Era&quot; as characterized by simply not seeing or not caring about the SOS God himself sent out through the hands of Simon and Garfunkel in the Sound of Silence; and through mine.</p>
<p>Yet here we are, talking about and reading about a tacit and clear prescient solution to the GTribulation, to school shootings and to &quot;murder in general&quot; and it&apos;s my belief that&apos;s the crux of this message that revolves around the Septuagint--and the September 11 &quot;full stop&quot; statement on the decline in honesty and humanity that we&apos;ve seen spiral downward and out of control since then.</p>
<p>Like you, I watched in horror as those attacks turned into ther erasure of American freedom and &quot;free speech,&quot; and like you I was equally surprised to see these events predicted in the Holy Bible; all the way back to the story of Exodus, which they revolve around ... and center ...  in the front of every eye that can see &quot;Burning Bush&quot; and how that begins to explain God speaking through the historical events of a civilizatiuon.  I am surprised today to see the Greek name for the Torah went unnoticed by me ... and you ... up until I stood on Sepulveda Blvd and connected that street in California to the Vedas and to the now famous Oppenheimer quote, &quot;and now we have overcome death, to see we have destroyed Hell by acting on the disclosure the existence of simulated worlds.&quot;</p>
<p>It&apos;s as simple as the Universal Studios Earth1quake ride; by responding to this message intelligently we overcome natural disaster (force majeure, &quot;acts of God&quot;), disease, death; and slavery.  It&apos;s that slavery that we don&apos;t see hiding &quot;Tea Party&quot; in the word Terran; that slavery that is bhiding it from the news and from every eye and every mind, that slavery ending is the focal point of this Revolution.</p>
