I note it doesn't include the word "psychotronics". Nor are there any obvious words which have a "tronic" suffix without the "elec". This just points to the fact that it's just a made up word which the progenitor thought sounded good rather than something specifically derived from latin or greek roots. This makes your etymology claim seem even more unlikely than I'd thought and I'm now totally convinced that it would be inappropriate to put it in the article. Thanks for clearing that up.

It is sent to a computer, which reworks it to the level needed for those who need to control the man, and the modified information is then reinserted into the brain.” These weapons are used against the mind to induce hallucinations, sickness, mutations in human cells, “zombification,” or even death. Included in the arsenal are VHF generators, X-rays, ultrasound, and radio waves. Russian army Major I.

  <td class="diff-deletedline"><div>:1. What's interesting about this topic is that none of the sources really agree as to what psychotronics mean, so this article should represent those sources fairly in an NPOV manner and not try to force one meaning onto a word which doesn't have a single meaning. For that reason, I don't think the lead is too bad. It briefly mentions the origins of the term, then explains that the term has been applied in different ways over time - ie, it summarises the article. I agree there's room for improvement, but suggest that improvement should be in working on a better structure to the article body first and then thinking about how the lead can best summarise that.</div></td>

Damonthesis, don't blame me for your actions in spending hours last night adding almost nothing but original research to the article, which had to be removed - and I went through your edits carefully paragraph by paragraph giving reasons for every reversion I made rather than just removing it wholesale. You did, however, find some excellent sources which this article sorely needed. Thank you for that - your work has not been wasted. I tried to represent those sources fairly in the article and you seem to be the only person who has a problem with my edits.

  <td class="diff-deletedline"><div>::This page. in its current incarnation is nothing more than disinformation.  You are attempting to obfuscate and hide a 50 year old russian research program, which has been noted time and time again in the news, military publications, and government legislation in both Russia and the US with a page about once scientist.  This page is a completely inaccurate reflection of the term "psychotronics" and does nothing but confuse the general public into thinking it's something that hasn't been talked about for 50 years.  Vladimir Putin, the President of Russian, just released a statement saying they were spending upwards of 100 million dollars on psychotronics research per year until 2016.   Do you think they are researching this man's machine?  Your edits this morning did not "have to be done" your reasons were not correct.  You removed numerous sources noting that 'psychotronics" were not mentioned, yet the names of the articles themselves included the term.  You do not have a good concept of what the term means, and thus have created a page that has no historical significance whatsoever. I'm not sure what your intentions are, but what you are doing is called censorship. 21:32, 30 April 2013 (UTC)  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class="autosigned"&gt;— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Damonthesis|Damonthesis]] ([[User talk:Damonthesis|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/Damonthesis|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;</div></td>

You are doing nothing but attempting to deflect from the fact that this information has been removed repeatedly for '''no reason''' at all.

The edits today have served to completely misrepresent the subject matter, and do nothing but create a false illusion that this program does not exist, which is clearly refuted by the article I linked.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Psychotronic_weapons">Psychotronic weapons</span></h2>
<p>The sentence "These campaigns are typically dismissed by psychologists as being a delusional response to auditory hallucinations similar to accounts of alien abductions" in the second paragraph should be removed. The sentence "The scientific community considers psychotronics to be pseudoscience" should be removed as well.
</p><p>Some victims are subject to harassment and organized stalking in their communities, some victims receive intentional false psychiatric diagnoses and in addition become victims of the systems, from which they are seeking help (medical institutions and law enforcement).
It is the responsibility to record and alert the world to these horrendous crimes and the extreme danger that these technologies pose to democracy, human rights, privacy, mental and physical freedom, and the health of all people. These are the most horrendous weapons and crimes imaginable."

<p>Regarding "The stuff you want to add is at best alarmist claptrap". Go to MEDLINE library and read scientific literature about mind and body control. What I want to add is not a claptrap, but an existing reality and testimonies of civilian people, who are used as involuntary human subjects in extreme experiments with psyche, most likely, classified military experiments. Educate yourself a little bit and only after that leave your comments. You look ignorant, Dbrodbeck.  <small><span class="autosigned">—&#160;Preceding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signatures" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment added by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Galinakurdina&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Galinakurdina (page does not exist)">Galinakurdina</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Galinakurdina" title="User talk:Galinakurdina">talk</a> • <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Galinakurdina" title="Special:Contributions/Galinakurdina">contribs</a>) 00:11, 6 June 2016 (UTC)</span></small>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dbrodbeck&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Dbrodbeck (page does not exist)">Dbrodbeck</a>, once again, read books and articles from the list of literature about mind and body control in MEDLINE that I put above in this section. Enough sources. There are hundreds and thousands of articles and books about brain-machine interface, neuroengineering, neural interfacing,  neuromechanical systems, neuroinformatics, neuroimaging, neural prostheses, artificial and biological neural circuits, neural control,  neural signal processing, neural modeling in MEDLINE library.
If you want to read something more popular than scientific, you can read articles: 
1. Microchip Implants, Mind Control, and Cybernetics by Rauni-Leena Luukanen-Kilde, MD, Former Chief Medical Officer of Finland, SPEKULA, 1999
2. ‘Matador’ With a Radio Stops Wired Bull Modified Behavior in Animals Subject of Brain Study By John A. Osmundsen
Reported in New York Times
3. We are moving ever closer to the era of mind control by Steven Rose reported in the Observer on February 05 2006 on p31 of the Comment section.
You can watch documentaries about mind control, broadcasted for millions of people on main TV channels in the USA and Russia&#160;:
1. Jesse Ventura’s video “Brain Invaders”
2. Mind Control Documentary: The Golden Dream of the World’s Masters.
You can find on YouTube testimonies of victims of Psychotronic (mind/body control) weapons before the Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical issues in USA in 2011.
But, first of all, I refer you to literature in MEDLINE library, approved by scientific community.  <small><span class="autosigned">—&#160;Preceding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signatures" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment added by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Galinakurdina&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Galinakurdina (page does not exist)">Galinakurdina</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Galinakurdina" title="User talk:Galinakurdina">talk</a> • <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Galinakurdina" title="Special:Contributions/Galinakurdina">contribs</a>) 01:37, 6 June 2016 (UTC)</span></small>
