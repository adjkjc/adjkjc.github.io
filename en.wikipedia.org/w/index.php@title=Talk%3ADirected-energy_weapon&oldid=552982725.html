Well, what can I say, Wikipedia is ahead of it's reputation. Although A-60 Soviet aircraft made in 70's with a laser gun on board was WAY before american recent 747, it is not even mentioned in the article, it is after articles like this one that clueless american kids are running around yelling that USA is ahead in technology. Also, I do not seem to find any mention of Ranets microwave gun, I will not go to detail about it, here is some material: <a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.ausairpower.net/APA-Rus-PLA-PD-SAM.html#Ranets">http://www.ausairpower.net/APA-Rus-PLA-PD-SAM.html#Ranets</a> and a western source too. Also, it would be nice to mention russian Almaz-Antey High Energy Laser Directed Energy Weapon, also can be read about on the page I gave, and yes, it is like Thel, only it is mobile. You know, you can in fact generalize on the issue. I wonder, will someone add the information I mentioned, will someone make this an unbiased article, are people in this encyclopedia wanna-be interested in writing an encyclopedia or in creating an opinion forum?

</p><p>Pavel: the americans have been putting laser on airplanes basically since lasers were invented - yes even back in the 70's. it's only been now however that the technology has matured to the point where a viable battlefield weapon could be made. the ABL is NOT the first american effort to putting such a laser on an airplane. Before you are overly critical of people getting their facts straight you should do so yourself.

</p><p>the 'medusa' doesnt even rise into the 'not likely to be produced int he real world' category. The link cited is fraught with a fundamental lack of understanding of the concepts involved and psuedo science. For example the electrons at the collector end of a klystron are no longer relatavistic. they loose the vast majority of their kinetic energy while radiating RF energy. thats how a klystron WORKS. The RF from the klystron isnt going to 'bunch' the output electron beam. due to the comparativly slow speed of the electrons they would be out of phase with the RF generated in under 1 cycle - while the beam was still in the machine. not to mention little things like if you wanted to do something like this you would use as small a frequency as possible so as to decrease the amount of laser power required to generate this plasma waveguide.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">—Preceding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signatures" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment added by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/71.98.163.50" title="Special:Contributions/71.98.163.50">71.98.163.50</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:71.98.163.50&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:71.98.163.50 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 02:08, 25 August 2009 (UTC)</span>

<h2><span id="Problems_with_lasers.2FBlooming"></span><span class="mw-headline" id="Problems_with_lasers/Blooming">Problems with lasers/Blooming</span></h2>
<p>This section needs clarification for various reasons: It neglects to define "blooming." It describes the plasma-forming effect of a powerful laser in the atmosphere (which I assume is the blooming effect) but then describes this as a positive effect for long range projection of the laser, rather than a problem. There is also a sentence noting that a laser is invisible unless something scatters its light, and the relevance of this isn't clear.
</p>
<ul><li><i>Continuous wave laser beam propagation through an absorbing medium heats the medium along the path of the beam; the heating of the medium then induces a local change in the index of refraction of the medium which, in turn, causes some effects of spreading, distorting, bending, or defocusing of the beam. These are known as thermal blooming or thermal lensing effects. One important consequence of these effects is to spread the laser beam over a larger area, thereby reducing the intensity incident on a target.</i> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.rand.org/pubs/reports/R1726/">[1]</a></li></ul>
<ul><li><i>High power phenomena such as thermal blooming arising from absorption of beam power in the beam line optics or gas within the beam line, generally causes the beam diameter to increase dramatically. In the case of CO2 laser radiation, thermal blooming can take place if a significant amount of water or organic vapour is present inside the beam path. Such vapour if result from the evaporation of the oil or grease hat are used to lubricate bellow sections of the beamline.</i> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://info.tuwien.ac.at/iflt/safety/section3/1_17_1fr.htm">[2]</a></li></ul>
<ul><li><i>Absorption of laser energy causes local heating of the air. The resulting local reduction in both the air density and refractive index causes the laser beam to undergo thermal blooming, i.e., defocusing. This deleterious process can be significantly reduced by choosing an operating wavelength in an atmospheric window where the absorption is low.</i> <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.nrl.navy.mil/content.php?P=04REVIEW59">[3]</a></li></ul>

</p><p>why not just use two lasers focused on the same target? It is certainly doable

</p><p>How would laser light lose power that fast if the laws of physics say otherwise then. The speed of light would be far too fast to have the bloom effect unless your aiming very long distances as this artice implies. ~~unknown~~  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">—Preceding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signatures" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment added by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/68.70.14.63" title="Special:Contributions/68.70.14.63">68.70.14.63</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:68.70.14.63" title="User talk:68.70.14.63">talk</a>) 17:49, 17 December 2010 (UTC)</span>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Microwave_guns">Microwave guns</span></h2>
<p>Microwave guns are NOT masers. Thats like calling a HERF gun a laser. Some companies think they can rename stuff to fit their "new" "cool" product but it needs to stop. Masers a hundred year old technology thats a direct prelude to lasers. The only major difference between masers and lasers, is that masers don't lase but they do have a lasing chamber that can get some limited wave form alignment in the beam. So, with that in mind I removed the "aka" reference from the Microwave section.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Move_or_Delete_Pulse_rifles">Move or Delete Pulse rifles</span></h2>
<p>Pulse rifles as defined in the article can include any weapon the fires in pulses. Who ever wrote that doesn't have a clue about modern small arms. Any pistol, sub machine gun, assault rifle, and/or machine gun would qualify as a "pulse rifle" if it includes a burst fire mode. Normally burst fire modes are three shots per pull of the trigger but this is adjustable on some guns or fully programmable on some very high tech weapons (there is an advanced OICW Landwarrior prototype that supports this and Glock has another "digital" weapon that supports it too). The G11 was released to market in the 80's, so this stuff is nothing "new". Very cool stuff but it does not belong in an article about direct energy weapons because it is not a direct energy weapon of any kind. Please move it or delete it.

Nothing referenced in the article nor found by myself (admittedly online only) has given any indication that the mention of Grindell-Matthews merits placement in this article. As such I am removing it. If any <i>valid</i> sources become available, preferably ones with more veracity than Grindell-Matthews himself, then of course it could be replaced. His refusal to provide proof, to anyone, of his claims, smacks of a con game. At least IMHO.

<dl><dd>Yes, I narrowly believe that an article about weapons should confine itself to weapons, and not spin speculation about things that can be used as weapons (which, as you know if you're a Monty Python fan, includes boxes of raspberries).

<dl><dd>I strongly disagree and consider (laser and non-laser) dazzlers to be weapons and useful context for the other types.  But we're not going to convince each other.  The new subsection on "Types" partly addresses my concerns but I'm wondering if it's not better to scrap this entire article and have the general categories listed under <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_weapon" class="mw-disambig" title="Energy weapon">Energy weapons</a> and then a separate article for each type: EMP, radio, laser, particle, sonic, mythical, fictional (ie raygun), etc.  Does the military have a standard definition for the term? -- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:JDX" title="User:JDX">JDX</a> 02:08, 13 July 2006 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Tesla_1">Tesla 1</span></h2>
<p>I added a quote to the Tesla section about his death ray.  I think the section needs to be changed; it is not proven that he was just lying.  With his brilliance, it is very possible that he built such a machine.  However, I do think it needs to be noted that he placed it next to his pigeons and told visitors there was a very dangerous weapon in the crate.  He may have been lying to scare others away from his pigeons, but if you read some of the newspaper articles at the time, you will see that he apparently knows what he is talking about.  Such specific mentions, as it involving four new inventions, suggests it is real.  If he were to make up such a number, it would surely be divisible by 3, and I think most people realize 4 is not divisible by 3.  I think the article should be changed, as there is a possibility that he did do as he said.

<p>I wouldn't completely agree with the above remark by KarlBunker.  As he says, there's a lot of nonsense associated with the subject but it's important to document that lore provided that it's clearly stated which claims are baseless and which can actually be attributed to Tesla and which are myths about the man.  The section should be reinstated with minor changes if someone will follow up on the cited references and clearly distinguish real achievements from the (publically reported) myths.  Arguably, the material could be moved to the article about Tesla, or at least the link from there to this article should be revised if this section is to remain excised. -- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:JDX" title="User:JDX">JDX</a> 06:59, 9 July 2006 (UTC)

<dl><dd>I agree with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:KarlBunker" class="mw-redirect" title="User:KarlBunker">KarlBunker</a>. I find that the article includes "arguments" for some of Tesla's scientifically unsupported claims stated in the article as fact to be very misleading. As someone unfamiliar with Tesla's work and was just reading a few choice articles about him, it is only until you read these discussion pages that there are refutations for some outlandish claims and "facts" in the articles. Treatment of the more outrageous claims as if they were in league with his many notable contributions, and as if there were not largely a consensus among modern scientists as to their improbability, should be cleaned up. As of this post JDX's suggestion to separate myth from man and fact from fiction has not been completed in a clear manner.</dd>
<dd>I don't suggest getting rid of the claims and myths, they're fun and interesting. I don't think anyone would like to see that. But I suspect the only reason they remain as is is because the user arguing that those claims be treated on the same level in the article, as others more solidly grounded in reality, seems personally offended by the notion that they could possibly be the mere fantasies of a brilliant mind nearing the end. That Tesla manages to convince people like the this user 70 years after his death is testament to his genius to be sure.</dd>
<dd>But let's get real here, don't let articles about such an important and interesting figure be hijacked by someone who cites outdated material exclusively and merely rephrases his opponents argument and aims it in the opposite direction. Someone whose argumentative skills never made it out of the schoolyard should not be allowed to impose his will after failing to make a valid point. May I suggest some sort of "disputed claims" header or tag? No one writes about the flat earth theory without including that it is false. The more ludicrous claims made by Tesla may be fact, in that they actually were said by him, but that doesn't mean they're any less ludicrous.</dd></dl>

<ul><li><ul><li>I also agree with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:KarlBunker" class="mw-redirect" title="User:KarlBunker">KarlBunker</a>. Writing and reading about Tesla is fun, because is there is something in it for everybody. Some like the scientific achievements, some enjoy his rather farflung ideas of the time when he was going nuts. AUthors also like Tesla. They can depict some of his more useful and intriguing ideas and use them to subsantiate their rather irrelevant claims. However, that is where the trouble starts. If someone (even a PhD) writes about a subject, it does not mean any of his/her claims are in any way scientifically sound. You can easily find papers about anything (and I mean ANYTHING), but only if the claims in these papers have been cross-checked by other members of the scientific community can they be used in further scientific discourse. Therefore, the articles by Corum, Corum and Daum cited above (18 years old and self-published!) cannot be used in a discourse. This is a major problem of Wikipedia. Many contributors believe that something is true because they found an interesting looking paper on it. Not so! Thus, be careful in what you claim to be "uniformed" or "verifiable facts."  <small><span class="autosigned">—Preceding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signatures" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment added by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Ramander&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Ramander (page does not exist)">Ramander</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Ramander" title="User talk:Ramander">talk</a> • <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Ramander" title="Special:Contributions/Ramander">contribs</a>) 13:47, 6 April 2009 (UTC)</span></small></li></ul></li></ul>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Problems_with_lasers">Problems with lasers</span></h2>
<p>I don't have any research, but I speculate that another hypothetical problem with lasers surrounds their stealthyness. A gun barrel could me made longer so that the only people who see the "muzzle flash" (if it can really be called that on a laser) are the ones being shot, but the real problem comes from noise and heat. Since all of the noise will probably come from the flash-evaporation of the target it would be very difficult to suppress the noise without using some hypothetical technology. 
</p><p>The heat could also allow some one with infrared vision to see the beem and follow it back to the person who fired it. I also have to wonder if the heat might linger. If the laser heats the air in it's path enough, then the heat dissipation might be slow enough that some one with an infrared camera could see and follow the trail for quite some time after firing the laser weapon.
</p><p>For those reasons, a Laser would be undesirable as an infantry weapon atleast. A self-propelled laser Counter Artillary unit could still adapt a sort of shoot &amp; scoot tactic.
</p><p>I didn't add this to the main article because I don't have any research to back it up, and it's just speculation. If the laser is fired for a short pulse, the heat disipation and tracking problem could be resolved. THe noise problem doesn't give away the position of the person firing it, but it does put other enemy units on alert. The affect of the noise could be lessoned by syncronizing the first volly of fire so that all enemy targets are eliminated simultaniously the way artillary batteries sincronize the times their ordinance strikes their targets. That my not be practical with infantry, and all of it is somewhat theoretical. It needs research to confirm if this actually occurs.
</p><p>Naturally combat weapons already do create a lot of noise, and tracer rounds reveal the shooters position. The real issue is just to what degree this happens.

</p><p>I do not think that noise will be problem with laser weapons in battlefield conditions.

</p><p>All current lasers have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_efficiency" title="Thermal efficiency">thermal efficiency</a> below 20%. That means over 80% of the energy is released as a waste heat. Imagine that as a IR target in battlefield conditions!

</p><p>With solid-state lasers the energy needed is generated by the vehicle. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M1_Abrams" title="M1 Abrams">M1 Abrams</a> has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gas_turbine" title="Gas turbine">gas turbine</a> engine that generates about 1000 kW.

</p><p>Now, if the 1000 kW output is used to fire the laser weapon, the general heat output would be 1400 kW (800 kW from the laser + 600 kW from the turbine).

This is my first time asking so please forgive me for any social error. It uses to be one of my hobbies to study Tesla's weapon designs. I think I still have a disk of his poorly sanitized papers on particle weapon designs.  Would this be a good idea to add? They were based partly on superheated mercury and are internationally illegal to use in war, but the article did not make reference to them. The papers were declared secret, but they only used a black marker type think to cover up the sections.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Lasers_do_produce_a_recoil">Lasers do produce a recoil</span></h2>
<ul><li>Under Lasers, it is stated that "Lasers do not produce recoil." when in fact they do. 2 simple theorems dictate so. The first is that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. The transmission of the laser MUST have an equal and opposite reaction, or recoil. Also, light carries some momentum, this means that is has some mass and velocity. If you change the velocity of the mass (as you do with a laser) then you apple some force. If energy is conserved, which it is, then there must be some normalizing force that leave the system in equilibrium, recoil. If you look into Heizenbergs Uncertainty Principle with some attention to detail you will see that we cant dircetly measure electron position and momentum because in measuring one (using light) we have to alter the other. Thus light can add momentum to a particle, meaning it must have momentum as well. However, I will grant any nay-sayers that the effect is nearly negligable and that you would never feel the effect with a typical hand held laser, but there is a great difference between typical hand held lasers and laser weaponary. 17:08, 21 December 2006 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:138.162.5.12&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:138.162.5.12 (page does not exist)">User:138.162.5.12</a></li>
<li>Ahem. Light has no mass (check <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon" title="Photon">Photon</a>). It would be pretty devastating if that were different, due to relativity (mass increasing with speed, with lim(infinite) at light speed. Light carries no momentum (which is mass * velocity^2, and as we know, x * 0 is 0). The reason that light can change the momentum of a particle is because light carres <i>energy</i>, not momentum. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:212.149.48.44&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:212.149.48.44 (page does not exist)">212.149.48.44</a> 15:54, 4 January 2007 (UTC)</li>

<li>It amazes me how many people lack an elementary knowledge of modern physics, and yet still post these kinds of comments without bothering to look them up.  Anyone who bothers to check a high-school physics book will see that light certainly does carry momentum.  Furthermore, radiation pressure and solar wind are responsible for the tail of a comet.  If some kind of sublimation pressure were responsible, it would push the gas and dust in all directions equally, rather than producing a distinct tail in one direction (notably, the direction that points directly away from the sun) as actually occurs. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Xezlec" title="User:Xezlec">Xezlec</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Xezlec" title="User talk:Xezlec">talk</a>) 01:23, 31 December 2007 (UTC)</li></ul>
<ul><li>actually, photons do have mass, but only in the form of relativistic and not rest mass. because of this, they should not have any inertial momentum, and hence should not have any recoil in the ordinary newtonian sense. (recoil assumes that an obect undergoes acceleration, and photons do not undergo acceleration for the simple reason that it is impossible to accelerate anything into lightspeed unless infinite energy is applied - if that were so, then the recoil energy must be infinite as well). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Ischaramoochie" title="User:Ischaramoochie">Ischaramoochie</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Ischaramoochie" title="User talk:Ischaramoochie">talk</a>) 01:30, 16 January 2008 (UTC)</li></ul>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>No, I'm afraid you are wrong.  I will say it again: please look it up before you make these kinds of statements.  But since no one seems willing to look it up, I will explain in more detail.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>"actually, photons do have mass, but only in the form of relativistic and not rest mass."</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Just to make sure we're speaking the same language, I will first point out that the word "mass" in normal modern physics usage means rest mass.  Otherwise there would be no reason to distinguish between "mass" and "energy" and it would become hard to talk about anything.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>"they should not have any inertial momentum, and hence should not have any recoil in the ordinary newtonian sense."</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>If you mean "if the universe obeyed Newtonian physics then there would be no recoil" then I agree.  If you mean "there is no recoil" then I disagree.  Photons have momentum whether you believe it or not.  The momentum p of a photon is given by the pretty famous formula p = E/c (that would be one of the first formulas you found if you had done a web search, but I digress).  You may be thinking of the Newtonian formula for momentum, p = mv, which, of course, is completely wrong at velocities near the speed of light (that's the whole point of relativity, actually).  In relativity, the formula for momentum is dilated by the same gamma factor (1 - v^2/c^2)^(-1/2) as all the other quantities, which obviously approaches infinity as v approaches c, mathematically canceling out the effect of the mass going to zero.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>"recoil assumes that an obect undergoes acceleration"</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>No, recoil is the ACT of a massive object "A" undergoing acceleration (receiving momentum) due to imparting momentum upon another (not necessarily massive) object "B".  There is no reason that object "B" has to accelerate if it is massless (in fact, if I recall correctly, massless objects can never accelerate or decelerate at all; they are all frozen at c).  It just has to receive momentum (which it does when it comes into existence). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Xezlec" title="User:Xezlec">Xezlec</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Xezlec" title="User talk:Xezlec">talk</a>) 05:22, 15 March 2008 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<ul><li>The most obvious answer would be far too short to be included in the article. The biggest advantage of energy weapons in general over mass-based weapons in general would be in terms of portability, versatility, and safety.

<ul><li>Unlike projectile weapons or bombs, lasers allow soldiers to engage targets instantly (or at the speed of light if you want to be pedantic), with great accuracy, and often at long range.

<dl><dd>Well of course,the real issues are Columb (electrical) repulsion and the magnetic field in space which is even worse near the Earth.  A 1 centimeter beam will spread out to a diameter 100s of times wider by the time it has traveled to the target.  And of course the beam will curve enough to make aiming extremely difficult.</dd></dl>
<p>Those are just the technical issues.  The politics of ICBMs makes it very worrying to have a bunch of energy weapons in orbit which could just as well be aimed at satellites and spacecraft.  Even the appearance of a good chance to survive a nuclear war could actually encourage one.

Anyone have a citation for that please? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Dream_Focus" title="User:Dream Focus"> <b><span style="color:blue">D</span><span style="color:green">r</span><span style="color:red">e</span><span style="color:orange">a</span><span style="color:purple">m</span> <span style="color:blue">Focus</span></b></a><b> 14:00, 18 May 2009 (UTC)</b>

<p>"Laser beams do not generate sound or light that would be detected by human senses when emitted, so the weapon would not betray its user's position when fired."
</p><p>While this is true about the beam, it isn't always true about either the target (mentioned before), or the weapon itself.  Some equipment can make a lot of sound - but the ones for weapons obviously would best be silent at least the source.
</p><p>A more practical use of lasers is to paint a target for a physical weapon such as a gravity or chemical bomb.

<dl><dd>Why would you consider deletion?  The subject is clearly notable.  Check Google news for it. <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;q=Directed-energy+weapon&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;tbo=u&amp;tbs=nws:1&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wn&amp;fp=6f32b8af52b7e0b8">[6]</a> It gets ample coverage in the media, various governments calling their systems that. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Dream_Focus" title="User:Dream Focus"> <b><span style="color:blue">D</span><span style="color:green">r</span><span style="color:red">e</span><span style="color:orange">a</span><span style="color:purple">m</span> <span style="color:blue">Focus</span></b></a><b> 07:11, 18 September 2010 (UTC)</b></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>I wasn't going to give feedback, because I have no idea if it will be considered and / or utilized. However, I will give some feedback:</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>I would consider this article for deletioin, first for some issues at the very begiinning of the aricle. The "Directed-Energy" weapons are being equated with science fiction weapons in the introduction. The way the introduction is written equal weight (if not more) is given to science fiction weapons. So, any serious scientist, student of science, or a general audience member who has a propensity for reading science, will not give this article any serious attention. For me, it is apples and oranges. If I am reading a written work from which I wish to gain knowledge, then Science based information (apples) does not belong with Science Fiction (oranges).   Science is real, and science fiction is not. The point is the article mixes two topics, which could be two articles. Furthermore, actually, the aritlce mixes at least three topics. Topic number one is science-based, topic number two is science fiction based, and topic number three is <i>Directed energy Toys, Film props or Animation</i>. Please understand that I am not critiscising science fiction. I have read Asimov, Arthur C. Clarke, Heinlen, and probably some others. These three are notable writers, and have probably advanced the field of science fiction. Who could ask for more than that?</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>The section entitled "Operational advantages", first of all is not referenced and sourced. Hence this is syntheisis <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:SYN" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:SYN">WP:SYN</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:OR" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:OR">WP:OR</a>. And I am not just talking about Wikipedia policy. The tenor of this whole section is like someone came up with some sort of logical conclusions about directed energy weapons, and lasers. I recognize some of the statements as true, but do they really relate to directed energy weapons?</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>The next section ("Problems and considerations") comes across as a recipe, or a section of a how to manual <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTMANUAL" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:NOTMANUAL">WP:NOTMANUAL</a>. Also this section does not appear to be referenced. The one reference in this section is linked to website with content that is mostly supposition <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:CRYSTAL" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:CRYSTAL">WP:CRYSTAL</a>. Furthermore, this one reference may not qualify as a reliabel source <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:RS" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:RS">WP:RS</a>. Also the critique of this section appears to apply to the sub-sections, as well.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>The article after these sections will take more time to analyze.  Having stated the above, the two sections after the introduction really should be thrown out because these are not sourced with references. Once references are applied, and the text is adapated to the references (not the other way around) then these sections should be restored. In any case they could be removed to be in agreement with policy and guidelines. However, personally, I don't want to make this about policy and guidelines. I would rather make this about having at least two decent articles. In other words,  split the science, and science fiction. Keep the apples with apples and the oranges with oranges. And I said, it is possible to create a third article (grapes? or pears?). ---- <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Steve_Quinn" title="User:Steve Quinn">Steve Quinn</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Steve_Quinn" title="User talk:Steve Quinn">talk</a>) 20:03, 18 September 2010 (UTC)
<dl><dd>I agree.  Historical accounts of Archimedes should remain though, MIT students actually proving you could burn a boat, as have others, by using that method.  The crap about Zeus shooting lightning bolts as a direct energy weapon I removed, since that has no place here by way of common sense.  Mentioning various attempts in the past to make weapons, like how the Japanese in World War 2 focused on using microwaves for a death ray, could be added, and existing such things better organized.  I'm going to do some work on it now.

<dl><dd>I must comment on the problems and consideration section that it is possible that there are literature out there about the blooming effect and such.  It would be very reasonable that physics theories can estimate what will happen.  The only problem, as in all wikipedia articles, is the RS and V.  For the current source, I too, must say that it sounds nothing like RS and more importantly, even IF it is RS, it does not contain what it was sourced for.(search contains no word of <i>blooming</i>, <i>phased</i>, <i>array</i>, not even <i>angle</i> could be found there.)  <small>—Preceding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signatures" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">signed</a> comment added by</small> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Mythsearcher" title="User:Mythsearcher">MythSearcher</a><sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Mythsearcher" title="User talk:Mythsearcher">talk</a></sup>  16:01, 19 September 2010 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>Deletion? No, not at all, but the article is too multi-faceted and perhaps could even be split, "directed energy weapons" in the military project catagory, and "directed energy weapons in science fiction" in the science fiction catagory, they are clearly two distinct issues. There also needs to be a line drawn between stating what someone theorizes a weapon COULD do if ever built or powerful enough, and what weapons either experimental or actually deployed have been proven to actually do.</dd>

<p>The paragraph von "Electric beam in a vacuum" is complete nonsense and/or redundant. There is no conventional electrical current in a vacuum (no conductor, no current); The only thing similar to a current would be a beam of free charged particles (electrons, protons or other ions), but this is already covered by the "particle beams".  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">—Preceding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signatures" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment added by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/84.11.16.250" title="Special:Contributions/84.11.16.250">84.11.16.250</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:84.11.16.250" title="User talk:84.11.16.250">talk</a>) 10:56, 2 December 2010 (UTC)</span>

</p><p>Today, one can modify a normal laser pointer to melt through various materials, and that is around the size of a pencil. To me, somthing the size of an rifle would have much more room to store power supply, and would be able to eaidly inflict burn wounds.

<p>Content is highly douptful, only source only states facts contrary to content. Source only contains information about a never-in-use research facility, and the method of scientist to get fundings for their projects by let it look like important work that could help win the war (already after the USA joined the war and the Nazis lost more and more battles).
Only mentoined DEW in the article is a prototype or copy of the prototype of the norwegian scientist Rolf Wideröe, who wanted to save his brother. Due to text structure and grammar, the author seems to connect this case to others where a man tried to get attention from German officials to gain something of interest (in this case the life of the brother), but without actual scientific foundation. Additionally, the text states, that the device should have been put there under tests, but never was due to the invasion.
</p><p>In brief: Only source describes a desperate war-monger, who turns to science for a wonder weapon, that were proclaimed as those by the scientist, but without any realistic foundation and only for the purpose of achieving personal goals (as more money for other research projects or saving lifes of relatives and co-workers).
