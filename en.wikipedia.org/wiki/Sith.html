<p>The <b>Sith</b> are the main antagonists of the <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars" title="Star Wars">Star Wars</a></i> universe.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="Sith.html#cite_note-2">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> The <b>Sith Order</b> are depicted as an ancient <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monastic" class="mw-redirect" title="Monastic">monastic</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraterocracy" class="mw-redirect" title="Kraterocracy">kraterocratic</a> organization of supernaturally gifted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Force" title="The Force">Force-wielders</a> driven by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machiavellianism_(politics)" title="Machiavellianism (politics)">Machiavellian</a> agenda of galactic domination and revenge against their arch-rivals, the <a href="Jedi.html" title="Jedi">Jedi</a> Order.
</p><p>Sith are ruthless and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Totalitarian" class="mw-redirect" title="Totalitarian">totalitarian</a> by design, in which a supreme <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autocratic" class="mw-redirect" title="Autocratic">autocratic</a> authority is concentrated in a single individual granted the honorific <b>Dark Lord of the Sith</b>. Transfer of power is conducted through state-sanctioned assassinations: when a <b>Sith Lord</b> grows complacent, begins to show weakness, and is eventually killed, their property and authority are transferred to the apprentice who killed them. Robberies, betrayal, and sabotage are commonplace; murder is acceptable so long as the culprit is not caught. This kraterocratic system ensures that Sith society nurtures some of the most vicious and competitive individuals in the galaxy and is only governed by those strong enough to seize control.
</p><p>Sith philosophy lionizes conflict as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalyst" class="mw-redirect" title="Catalyst">catalyst</a> for growth and as a tool for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purge" title="Purge">purging</a> the unworthy. Sith academies were structured with rules, lectures, and classes, with an underlying "kill or be killed" mentality amongst the apprentices. Sith emphasize "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_of_the_fittest" title="Survival of the fittest">survival of the fittest</a>" and view <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-control" title="Self-control">restraint</a> as a weakness. Members adhere to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_morality" class="mw-redirect" title="Master morality">master morality</a>, are characterized by the desire to seize power by any means necessary, leveraging force (both physical and supernatural), social maneuvering, and political cunning to their advantage. The Sith cultivate a connection to the dark side of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Force" title="The Force">the Force</a>, which provides them with easy access to superhuman power and arcane knowledge; however, the trade-off is the severe cost of adopting a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_triad" title="Dark triad">dark triad</a> personality that corrodes their basic capacity for empathy, kindness, and love.
</p><p>Throughout <i>Star Wars</i> media and in popular culture, the Sith are infamous as the dualistic antagonists to the <a href="Jedi.html" title="Jedi">Jedi</a>, an affiliation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altruistic" class="mw-redirect" title="Altruistic">altruistic</a> warriors who strive to use their own martial training and connection to the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_side" class="mw-disambig" title="Light side">light side</a>" of the Force to promote peace and the common welfare throughout the galaxy. To counteract the Jedi's benevolent influence, the Sith were responsible for secretly instigating many small regional conflicts as part of their larger plan to destabilize the Republic and eventually take control of the galaxy. Hiding from the shadows, their fingerprints are everywhere, in every conflict in the galaxy, and their subversive influence reaches far and wide. Over their long history, the Sith have established great empires, come close to realizing their ambitions of galactic conquest, and nearly eradicated the Jedi. Ultimately, however, they are self-defeating, their grand plans undone time and again by internal strife, rebellion inspired by their vicious tactics, and the psychologically noxious effects of their dark arts and philosophy.

<p>The word <i>Sith</i> was first used in the 1974 rough draft of <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_(film)" title="Star Wars (film)">Star Wars</a></i><sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="Sith.html#cite_note-3">&#91;3&#93;</a></sup> with the first published use being the 1976 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_From_the_Adventures_of_Luke_Skywalker" title="Star Wars: From the Adventures of Luke Skywalker">novelization of <i>Star Wars</i></a> as a title for the key villain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darth_Vader" title="Darth Vader">Darth Vader</a>, the "Dark Lord of the Sith". Sith characters had also been portrayed as such in some non-canonical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_expanded_to_other_media" title="Star Wars expanded to other media"><i>Star Wars</i> Legends</a> works prior to the release of <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Phantom_Menace" class="mw-redirect" title="The Phantom Menace">The Phantom Menace</a></i>, and in archived footage for the original <i>Star Wars</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="Sith.html#cite_note-4">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup>  Prior to the formal introduction of the Sith, the term "Dark Jedi" was sometimes used for characters who would be later identified as Sith, or had goals and practices similar to the Sith. In his novel series <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Thrawn_Trilogy" class="mw-redirect" title="The Thrawn Trilogy">The Thrawn Trilogy</a></i>, author <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Zahn" title="Timothy Zahn">Timothy Zahn</a> labeled Sith Lord Darth Vader and Emperor <a href="Palpatine.html" title="Palpatine">Palpatine</a> as "Dark Jedi", and the term "Sith" was never mentioned in the series until later reprints of the novels. "Dark Jedi" is also the name given in the <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars" title="Star Wars">Star Wars</a></i> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictional_universe" title="Fictional universe">universe</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antihero" title="Antihero">antihero</a> fictional characters attuned to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Force" title="The Force">the Force</a> and adept in its Dark Side. However, the concept of "Dark Jedi" is not referenced anywhere in any of the theatrical <i>Star Wars</i> films, and they exist by that name only in non-canonical <i>Star Wars</i> Legends media, including video games such as <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Knights_of_the_Old_Republic_(series)" title="Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic (series)">Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</a></i> and the <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Jedi_Knight_(series)" class="mw-redirect" title="Star Wars: Jedi Knight (series)">Star Wars: Jedi Knight</a></i> series. The Sith were not mentioned by name in canonical stories until the prequel trilogy used the word on film starting with 1999's <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Phantom_Menace" class="mw-redirect" title="The Phantom Menace">The Phantom Menace</a></i>.

The works of philosopher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche" title="Friedrich Nietzsche">Friedrich Nietzsche</a> and mythologist <a href="Joseph_Campbell.html" title="Joseph Campbell">Joseph Campbell</a>, especially his book <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hero_with_a_Thousand_Faces" title="The Hero with a Thousand Faces">The Hero with a Thousand Faces</a></i> (1949), directly influenced Lucas, and was what drove him to create the 'modern myth' of <i>Star Wars</i>.<sup id="cite_ref-swmyth_5-0" class="reference"><a href="Sith.html#cite_note-swmyth-5">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="Sith.html#cite_note-6">&#91;6&#93;</a></sup>  In particular, the contrasting narrative relationship between the Dark Side-using Sith and light side-using Jedi mirrors several modern and classical literary tropes.
</p><p>Most prominently, the conflict between the Sith and Jedi employs the classic trope of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-and-white_dualism" title="Black-and-white dualism">black and white moral dualism</a>—an elemental contrast between evil (the "darkness") and good (the "light") first postulated and elaborated in <a href="Zoroastrianism.html" title="Zoroastrianism">Zoroastrianism</a>, from which the core mythos of Star Wars is much influenced.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="Sith.html#cite_note-7">&#91;7&#93;</a></sup>  The ongoing struggle of the humanistic "light side"-affiliated Jedi to permanently defeat the egoistic "Dark Side"-affiliated Sith is framed not only as a contest of values, but as a deep metaphysical conflict: The Dark Side of the Force is viewed by the Jedi, and generally represented within <i>Star Wars</i> media, as not only a dangerous expedient but as a form of existential corruption which must be purged for the universe, or a person, to attain spiritual balance.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="Sith.html#cite_note-8">&#91;8&#93;</a></sup>  Jedi are often depicted as imperfect individuals, but their cause of selfless heroism is ultimately on the right side of an inexorable cosmic struggle against evil, embodied in the power-hungry Sith and the Dark Side of the Force.
</p><p>The dualistic relationship between the Sith' and the Jedi' concepts of "purity" mirrors the philosophical and literary concept of "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollonian_and_Dionysian" title="Apollonian and Dionysian">Apollonian and Dionysian</a>": the Jedi are portrayed as embracing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purity_in_Buddhism" title="Purity in Buddhism">purity</a>, reason, temperance, altruism and other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanism" title="Humanism">humanistic virtues</a>; the Sith, by contrast, embrace curiosity, emotion, conflict, power, instincts, unfettered self-interest and other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonism" title="Hedonism">hedonistic vices</a>. However, whereas the classic Greek concept did not necessarily view the Apollonian and Dyonisian principles as opposed, <i>Star Wars</i> frames the Jedi and Sith as opponents in a dire moral struggle, with the Sith cast as corrupted villains apparently destined to defeat or self-destruction in the end.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="Sith.html#cite_note-9">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup>  Although a path to temporary power, the Sith way inevitably leads to ruin.
</p><p>Within the <i>Star Wars</i> narrative, the Jedi and Sith naturally have different self-understandings. In Sith rhetoric, the relationship between the philosophies of the Jedi and Sith closely mirrors Nietzsche's concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master%E2%80%93slave_morality" title="Master–slave morality">master–slave morality</a>. Sith value "master" virtues, such as pride and power, whereas the Jedi value altruistic virtues like kindness and empathy. The goal of the Sith is tangible greatness: the ability to shape and destroy the world according to one's will alone. The goal of the Jedi is moral goodness: freedom from inner, and outer, turmoil and suffering. However, the Sith consider the Jedi's aspirations to be either hopeless or pathetic. To the Sith, greater power is the only authentic goal.

<p>Originally, George Lucas conceived of the Sith as a group that served the <a href="Palpatine.html" title="Palpatine">Emperor</a> in the same way that the <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schutzstaffel" title="Schutzstaffel">Schutzstaffel</a></i> had served <a href="Adolf_Hitler.html" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>.

<p>The Sith are dedicated to the "Sith Code" and to mastering the Dark Side of the Force.<sup id="cite_ref-sw-en_11-0" class="reference"><a href="Sith.html#cite_note-sw-en-11">&#91;11&#93;</a></sup> The Sith Code identifies conflict as the fundamental dynamic of reality, and holds that the search for lasting peace, within or without, is both quixotic and misguided. Rather, Sith embrace strife and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passions_(philosophy)" title="Passions (philosophy)">dark passion</a> as salutary and emancipatory forces, as they believe that violent struggle purges the decadent and weak, and that emotions such as aggression and hate provide the strength and resolve to secure freedom through victory. Although Sith seek dominion, Sith philosophy stresses that power belongs only to those with the strength, cunning, and ruthlessness to maintain it, and thus "betrayal" among the Sith is not a vice but an endorsed norm. Accordingly, the Sith reject altruism, self-abnegation and kindness, as they regard such attitudes as founded on delusions that fetter one's perceptions and power. In connection with their philosophy, the Sith draw on the Dark Side of the Force through severe negative emotions, a technique antipodal to that of their archenemies, the Jedi, who rely on the Force's "light side," i.e., the Force as experienced through disciplined states of quietude and compassion. Notably, both the Jedi and Sith shun romantic and familial love, as the Jedi fear such love will lead to attachment, and thus selfishness, and the Sith fear it will compromise their ruthlessness and connection to the Dark Side of the Force. 
Although the Sith are intimately linked to the Dark Side, not every user of the Dark Side is a Sith, nor is every user of the light side a Jedi.

<p>The Dark Side of the Force is stigmatized as seductive, corruptive, and addictive by the Jedi, who view it as evil,<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="Sith.html#cite_note-12">&#91;12&#93;</a></sup> whereas the Sith consider the Dark Side of the Force to be its most powerful manifestation, and regard the abstemious Jedi as blinded by false virtue. As portrayed in all <i>Star Wars</i>-related media, the Dark Side provides users with powers similar to those of the light side-using Jedi, but as it leverages passion and violence, its use is enhanced by negative raw and aggressive emotions and instinctual feelings such as anger, greed, hatred, and rage. By deciding to learn the ways of the Dark Side of the Force, the Sith may also acquire powers and abilities considered by some in the <i>Star Wars</i> universe to be unnatural.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="Sith.html#cite_note-13">&#91;13&#93;</a></sup> A notable example is a form of directed dielectric breakdown called "Force Lightning," infamously used by the Sith Lord <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darth_Sidious" class="mw-redirect" title="Darth Sidious">Darth Sidious</a> to torture Jedi-initiate and rebel Luke Skywalker. Darth Sidious claimed that his own master, Darth Plagueis, could even use the Force to avert the natural deaths of those whose lives he wished to save. Being uninhibited in their use of the Force, Sith could also repurpose abilities shared with the Jedi, such as telekinesis, to new and terrifying effect: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darth_Vader" title="Darth Vader">Darth Vader</a> was infamous for his use of telekinetic strangulation, or "Force Choke," as a means of execution or intimidation.

<p>Extended indulgence in the Dark Side reshapes the user's psychology, resulting in a loss of humanity, morality, empathy, and the ability to love, leaving every Sith, to varying degrees, amoral, cruel, sadistic and violent. Considering this dark change in personality to be a transformation into a different person altogether, some who turn to the Dark Side take on a different name, as they regard their former persona as dead and destroyed. Sith Lords, in particular, adopt a new name upon their initiation into the Order, prefixing it with the title <b>Darth</b> (e.g., "Darth Vader"). Severe saturation in the Dark Side may even lead to physical degradation. Although Sith are deeply affected by the Machiavellian methods and dark arts they practice, they are not portrayed as necessarily irredeemable: Some Sith, most famously <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darth_Vader" title="Darth Vader">Darth Vader</a> in the final moments of his life, have renounced the Order and the Dark Side of the Force.

<p>Martial arts are a core part of the Sith tradition, and Sith featured in the <i>Star Wars</i> film series have all been highly trained warriors who further augment their abilities with the Force. Like the Jedi, the Sith's signature armament is an extremely lethal focused energy melee weapon known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightsaber" title="Lightsaber">lightsaber</a>, which (generally) only those trained in the ways of the Force can use effectively. Sith use lightsabers in combination with Force-derived powers, such as telekinesis, enhanced dexterity and precognition, to achieve superhuman combat prowess. A fully trained Sith is depicted as being at least a match for a well-trained Jedi Knight, and either can handily defeat multiple ordinary attackers armed with projectile weapons. In matters of dress, Sith may adopt any attire consistent with their plans or guise; they commonly favor black robes, armor and gis when presenting themselves authentically.

<p>In the <i>Legends</i> continuity, the Sith Order began around 6,900 BBY, during a period known as the Hundred Year Darkness. A series of conflicts began between the rebellious dark Jedi, a faction of the Jedi Order, and the rest of the Order. The dark Jedi were defeated and cast out, exiled to the unknown regions. These Exiles came across the planet Korriban, and its native species, the Sith. The strongest among the Exiles, Ajunta Pall, became the first to hold the title Dark Lord of the Sith. His contemporaries, such as Karness Muur and XoXaan became Sith Lords. The human Dark Jedi interbred with the Sith species, who also had an affinity for the Dark Side. They would become the original Sith Empire.
</p><p>One of the earliest leaders of this Sith Empire was Tulak Hord. He expanded the Sith territories and conquered the Dromund System, home to Dromuund Kaas, later the capital of the Sith Empire. He was eventually followed by Marka Ragnos, the last ruler of a period known as the Golden Age of the Sith. Upon the passing of Ragnos, two contenders for the throne of Dark Lord, Naga Sadow and Ludo Kressh, dueled at his funeral. Eventually, after a series of conflicts, Sadow was victorious, and Kressh apparently killed.
</p><p>Sadow began the Great Hyperspace War, invading the Republic and laying siege to its planets. Sadow's efforts were initially met with success, his forces amplified by illusions that Sadow projected from his meditation sphere. Unfortunately, the Dark Lord's concentration was broken when his apprentice turned on him. With his illusions dispersed, Sadow's forces were forced to retreat. Upon returning to Sith space, they found that Kressh had not been killed, and engaged him in a space battle. Sadow was victorious again, but they were soon attacked by Republic forces. Sadow escaped by causing the Denarii Binary Star to go supernova.
</p><p>The Sith Empire would eventually rise again, with the rise of Exar Kun and Ulic Qel-Droma. The spirit of the deceased Dark Lord, Marka Ragnos, declared Kun Dark Lord of the Sith, and made Qel-Droma his apprentice. Allying themselves with warriors such as the Mandalorians, Kun and Qel-Droma declared war on the Galactic Republic. During a raid on the Jedi Library at Ossus, Qel-Droma dueled and killed his brother, but was captured. Qel-Droma was redeemed and was instrumental in Kun's downfall, when the latter retreated to Yavin 4.
</p><p>At some point following the Mandalorian Wars, the individuals known as Revan and Alek declared themselves Sith Lords, and became Darth Revan and Darth Malak respectively. Their brutal campaign against the Republic was hugely successful. Revan was eventually betrayed by Malak, allowing a Jedi strike team to capture him. Malak continued his conquest without Revan's tactical leadership until a redeemed Revan defeated him, and the Star Forge, the source of the Sith Fleet was destroyed.
</p><p>Remnants of Revan's Sith Empire, led by the Sith Triumvirate, consisting of Darth Traya, Darth Nihilus, and Darth Sion, began a shadow war against the Jedi. This First Jedi Purge, brought the Jedi Order to the brink of extinction. Their downfall came about when Meetra Surik, a Jedi who was exiled after the Mandalorian Wars, returned to known space. She defeated the three Sith, and without the Sith leadership, and the destruction of their base of operations on Malachor V, the remaining Sith forces faded into obscurity.
</p><p>Around 300 years later, the original Sith Empire, now under the leadership of Emperor Vitiate, emerged from the Unknown Regions and declared war on the republic. This war, dubbed the Great Galactic War, was halted when Vitiate, on the cusp of victory, was restrained by the telepathic prowess of Revan. After a period of non-fighting, called the Galactic Cold War, tensions boiled over, and the Galactic War began. The Sith empire eventually fell to infighting and mostly disappeared. Occasionally, a Dark Lord such as Darth Rivan or Darth Ruin, would rise and fall, but the Sith did not become a major threat again until around 2,500 years later.
</p><p>At this point, the Brotherhood of Darkness arose, led by the Sith Lord Skere Kaan. They focused on controlling the infighting between the Sith. This policy allowed them to make great progress in their war against the Republic. Ironically, one of their own, a Sith Lord by the name of Bane turned on them, because he disapproved of their methods. He manipulated the Brotherhood into extinction, and they were defeated. Bane started the Rule of Two, which evolved into the Sith as they are seen in the films.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Emergence_of_the_Sith_Order">Emergence of the Sith Order</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sith&amp;action=edit&amp;section=7" title="Edit section: Emergence of the Sith Order">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h4>
<p>The origin, agenda, abilities and philosophy of the Sith are intertwined with their relationship to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Force" title="The Force">the Force</a>. With proper training, the Force may be called upon by rare individuals capable of "sensing" or "touching" it to achieve extraordinary feats such as telekinesis, precognition and mental suggestion. Not all psychological states are conducive to employing the Force; discipline is required. However, both quietude and focused, intense passion alike can be effective. The Sith originated in a species of Force-sensitive warriors who discovered the efficacy of passion as a tool to draw on the Force at least 5,000 years prior to the events of the first <i>Star Wars</i> film.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="Sith.html#cite_note-16">&#91;16&#93;</a></sup> Fully embracing this approach, they became defined and corrupted by it.
</p><p>The warriors who would become the first Sith were apparently heterodox members of an older martial order of Force-sensitive sapient beings in the <i>Star Wars</i> universe: The Jedi. The Jedi served as a space-faring <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_order_(monastic_society)" class="mw-redirect" title="Military order (monastic society)">knightly order</a> within the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_Republic" title="Galactic Republic">Galactic Republic</a>, a representative democracy encompassing most developed worlds. The Jedi Order sought to use the powers of the Force to help defend the weak and advance the rule of law across the galaxy, in keeping with their ethics of self-sacrifice and service to the common welfare. The Jedi creed mirrored their method of utilizing the Force, and Jedi doctrine favored states of serenity, detachment, compassion, and humility as the proper means of accessing its power. When members of the Jedi Order began to experiment with passion as an alternative, controversy emerged. The Jedi establishment saw these innovations as a threat to the ethos of the Jedi, opening members to the seduction of aggrandizement and cruelty. Eventually, this controversy led to a sectarian conflict in which the heterodox Jedi were defeated and exiled.<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="Sith.html#cite_note-17">&#91;17&#93;</a></sup>
</p><p>In exile, the dissident Jedi were free to explore the relationship between passion and the Force. They concluded that the martial and ethical disciplines of the Jedi establishment were foolish and misguided: Passion, not quietude, was the most potent means of accessing the Force, and conflict, not peace, was the natural and healthy state of the universe. Rejecting the self-abnegation of their forebears, the exiles now embraced ruthless personal ambition, believing that power belonged to those with the cunning and strength to seize it. In their training, the dissidents would seek to master the Force by cultivating dark passions such as anger and hate, a practice anathematized by the Jedi as taking recourse to the Force's "Dark Side." Guided by their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Might_makes_right" title="Might makes right">kratocratic</a> and egoistic philosophy and armed with taboo Dark Side techniques, the former Jedi exiles would reemerge to menace the galaxy as the Sith Order, aiming to conquer the Galactic Republic and exact revenge against the Jedi.
</p><p>A succession of Sith-led regimes would arise to challenge the Jedi and the Galactic Republic.<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="Sith.html#cite_note-18">&#91;18&#93;</a></sup> However, internal power struggles would prove decisive in thwarting the Sith's designs. The paradox of reconciling endless personal ambition with corporate action would become a great practical and philosophical concern for the Sith. Ultimately, this paradox would be “resolved” through a drastic reorganization effected by a leader named Darth Bane, who recast the Sith in an esoteric lineal master-apprentice tradition known as “The Rule of Two.”<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="Sith.html#cite_note-19">&#91;19&#93;</a></sup> Thereafter (at least, as a matter of orthodoxy) there would be only two Sith at a time: One to embody power, and another to crave it. While concealing their identity as Sith, a succession of Sith masters and apprentices would work through the centuries to inveigle or force themselves into positions of power and undermine responsible government, preparing the Galactic Republic for eventual usurpation. The Banite tradition encouraged each apprentice to eventually challenge and slaughter his or her master, and take an apprentice in turn. In this way, Darth Bane guaranteed the conspiracy remained a secret for a thousand years; he believed that the kratocratic essence of Sith philosophy could be reconciled with a sustained project of galactic domination and revenge against the Jedi. The first six <i>Star Wars</i> films chronicle the consummation, and eventual undoing, of this ancient scheme.

By manipulating disgruntled factions within the Galactic Republic, Palpatine orchestrated civil war. This conflict, known within the <i>Star Wars</i> universe as the "<a href="Clone_Wars_(Star_Wars).html" title="Clone Wars (Star Wars)">Clone Wars</a>", provided a justification for consolidating power in the Galactic Republic's chief executive and assembling a large army of hastily cloned soldiers—surreptitiously conditioned to obey certain key commands issued by Palpatine. Although the Jedi eventually discovered Palpatine's identity as a Sith and attempted to arrest him, this action was anticipated by Palpatine, who framed their actions as an attempted coup, providing in turn a pretext for annihilating the Jedi by activating “Order 66,” one of the clone soldiers’ embedded protocols. In the course of effecting his designs, Palpatine also manipulated the Jedi's most powerful initiate, Anakin Skywalker, into his service, by promising to teach Skywalker Dark Side techniques that could save the life of <a href="Padmé_Amidala.html" title="Padmé Amidala">Padmé Amidala</a>, a Galactic Senator to whom Skywalker was secretly married in violation of Jedi rules, and whose death in childbirth Skywalker had preternaturally foreseen. In a tragic irony, Amidala's sheer horror at discovering Skywalker's collaboration with Sidious in destroying the Jedi would itself be the cause of her death during childbirth, though Sidious would trick Skywalker into believing that an episode of Skywalker's physical abuse of Amidala had been the actual cause of her death. Skywalker's subsequent emotional collapse would lead him to fully embrace the Dark Side of the Force and assume the persona of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darth_Vader" title="Darth Vader">Darth Vader</a>, Lord of the Sith. With Darth Vader at his side, the Emperor would rule the newly styled Galactic Empire for approximately 20 years as its Emperor. Initially unknown to Vader and Sidious, two children were delivered by Padme before her death.

<p>In the <i>Legends</i> continuity, Darth Andeddu, also known as the Immortal God-King of Prakith, was an ancient Dark Lord of the Sith who lived prior to the invention of the "Darth" title for the Sith. He was a paranoid man, who believed that his followers were secretly plotting to overthrow him, which eventually came true, as they betrayed and attacked him, seeking to steal his power. Forced to flee from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korriban" class="mw-redirect" title="Korriban">Korriban</a>, Andeddu created the world of Prakith, where he would rule as a deity for several centuries until meeting his demise and entombing himself to prevent his followers from stealing his secrets even in death. Prior to his death, he would also create a Sith holocron to store all his knowledge, including the ability to cheat death by transferring one's essence into another vessel, and his cult, called "the Malevolence", would create a temple in the reverence of the Dark Lord, believing that one day he would return. The legend of Andeddu and his incredible power remained at large long after his death, despite the Jedi Order's attempt to erase all knowledge and reference about the Sith.

He and his comrade, Malak, later unwittingly discovered the Sith Empire, hidden in the Unknown Reaches of space. The Sith Emperor, using Sith sorcery, turned Revan and Malak to the Dark Side, but the two broke free from his control and formed their own Sith Empire to wage war on the Republic, with Revan as the leader and Malak as his Sith Apprentice. As a Sith, Revan prepared to battle with the Jedi who boarded his flagship, and Darth Malak, in the hopes of destroying both Revan and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bastila_Shan" class="mw-redirect" title="Bastila Shan">Bastila Shan</a>, betrayed his master, ordering the ships under his command to fire on Revan's flagship's bridge. Revan was critically injured and taken by Bastila Shan to the Jedi Council Enclave. The Council chose to wipe Revan's memory, and imprint him with a false identity. Revan later awoke on a starship under attack and encountered Malak, who eventually revealed the truth of his identity. Following this, Revan defeated Malak in a final battle, claiming victory for the Republic. Revan later married Bastila Shan with the approval of the Jedi Council and eventually departed into the Unknown Regions to confront the Sith Emperor, but was imprisoned for 300 years until his descendant Satele Shan rescued him.

However, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahsoka_Tano" title="Ahsoka Tano">Ahsoka Tano</a> was sent to deal with him instead, and he unsuccessfully tried to convince her to join forces and defeat Sidious. Maul was defeated and captured by Ahsoka, though she freed him when Sidious executed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_66_(Star_Wars)" class="mw-redirect" title="Order 66 (Star Wars)">Order 66</a>, causing Ahsoka's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clone_trooper" title="Clone trooper">clone troopers</a> to turn on her, and he created a distraction to help her escape, before fleeing himself. During the Galactic Empire era, Maul, having abandoned his Sith persona, led the Crimson Dawn crime syndicate, until being left stranded on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malachor" class="mw-redirect" title="Malachor">Malachor</a> for years. He escaped after meeting Jedi Padawan <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezra_Bridger" class="mw-redirect" title="Ezra Bridger">Ezra Bridger</a>, whom he attempted to turn to the dark side, and later forced to help him locate the long-absent Obi-Wan Kenobi. Upon tracking him down to Tatooine, he confronted Kenobi and fought him one final time. Maul was fatally injured and died in Kenobi's arms, finally letting go of his hatred for him, as he realized that Kenobi was looking after the <a href="Luke_Skywalker.html" title="Luke Skywalker">boy</a> he believed to be the Chosen One and would one day destroy the Sith, avenging all those who had suffered because of them, including Maul.

He played an important role in Sidious' plans to take over the galaxy, engineering the Clone Wars by recruiting the bounty hunter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jango_Fett" title="Jango Fett">Jango Fett</a> as the template for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clone_trooper" title="Clone trooper">clone army</a> that would be used by the Republic, and forming the Confederacy of Independent Systems, consisting of numerous planets and systems who wanted to become independent from the Republic.

<p>Darth Vader (Anakin Skywalker) was a male human-cyborg Sith Lord and the third and final apprentice of Darth Sidious, who first appeared in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars#original_trilogy" title="Star Wars"><i>Star Wars</i> original trilogy</a>, and later in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars#Prequel_trilogy" title="Star Wars">the prequel trilogy</a>. As the Jedi hero Anakin Skywalker, he fought alongside his master Obi-Wan Kenobi during the galaxy-wide Clone Wars, but was slowly seduced to the dark side by Darth Sidious. After helping Sidious kill Jedi Master <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mace_Windu" title="Mace Windu">Mace Windu</a>, he swore allegiance to the Sith and was given the name Darth Vader before setting out to destroy all Jedi left on Coruscant. After being sent by Sidious to assassinate the Separatist council members on Mustafar, Vader was badly injured in a duel with Kenobi, resulting in the loss of his remaining organic arm, both legs, and severe burn injuries. He was saved by Sidious, and encased in a black suit of armor with extensive cybernetics which kept him alive. As the Galactic Empire was established and continued to grow, Vader became the Emperor's immensely feared second-in-command and was given the task of finding surviving Jedi and the <a href="Rebel_Alliance.html" title="Rebel Alliance">Rebel Alliance</a>'s base. After the destruction of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Star" title="Death Star">first Death Star</a>, Vader was charged with tracking down the Rebel Alliance and destroying their headquarters. However, the actions of his son, <a href="Luke_Skywalker.html" title="Luke Skywalker">Luke Skywalker</a>, eventually turned Vader against his master, resulting in both Sidious' and Vader's deaths, as well as the fulfilment of the Chosen One prophecy.<sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="Sith.html#cite_note-31">&#91;31&#93;</a></sup>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asajj_Ventress" title="Asajj Ventress">Asajj Ventress</a> was a female Dathomirian Sith Shadow Hand trained under Darth Tyranus and an antagonist of the <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_Clone_Wars_(2008_TV_series)" title="Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)">Star Wars: The Clone Wars</a></i>.

After tracking the young war hero to the planet Muunilinst, Ventress engaged Anakin's Republic fighter forces fighting above the Separatist-occupied world and baited him in a chase to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yavin_IV" class="mw-redirect" title="Yavin IV">Yavin 4</a>, where a fierce battle from the forest to the Massassi temple took place. Though she initially gained the upper hand in the ensuing lightsaber duel, Anakin called upon his immense connection to the Force to brutally overpower her, causing the Dathomirian to fall over the edge of a cliff. She luckily survived the landing and continued to serve her master throughout the Clone Wars on several occasions. Some of which included helping form an alliance between the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toydarians" class="mw-redirect" title="Toydarians">Toydarians</a> and the Separatists until Yoda thwarted it, spying on Kamino in a Separatist plot to destroy the clone production facilities while stealing Jango Fett's DNA template, and freeing Trade Federation viceroy Nute Gunray from the custody of Luminara Unduli and Ahsoka Tano while fighting the two Jedi before ultimately succeeding in her mission. After being replaced with Savage Opress for her failures, Ventress returned to the Nightsisters until General Grievous led a massacre against them, which only she and Mother Talzin survived. From there, she helped <a href="../../bit.ly/2xodX3V.html" title="Boba Fett">Boba Fett</a>'s team of bounty hunters on a dangerous mission, which thus marked the start of her own bounty hunting career.

However, their attempt to kill Dooku failed, and Dooku captured Vos, turning him to the dark side. Ventress managed to turn Vos back, but died saving him from an angered Dooku and was later buried on Dathomir, amongst her fallen sisters.

Originally a Nightbrother under Mother Talzin on Dathomir, he was handpicked by Asajj Ventress as part of her scheme to kill Darth Tyrannus for the attempt on her life. His mind was eventually altered by the Nightsisters, making him more of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berserker" title="Berserker">berserker</a> on Ventress' call to the point of killing his brother Feral without remorse. Opress managed to become Tyrannus' new Shadow Hand and learned only a little about the ways of the Sith before Ventress had him help her fight their master due to his actions under him getting unwanted attention from the Jedi. However, in the heat of the moment and provoked by both of them, Opress tried to kill both Tyrannus and Ventress before escaping back to Dathomir. There, he was instructed by Mother Talzin to find Maul so that he could complete his training to defend himself against the numerous enemies he had made. After finding his long-lost brother as a shell of his former self on a junk planet, Opress managed to stir up Maul's grudge with Obi-Wan Kenobi to aid him in his revenge against the Jedi. From there, the Zabrak duo were able to set up a Confederacy against the Republic separate from the Separatists, and soon took over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandalore" class="mw-redirect" title="Mandalore">Mandalore</a>. However, they received an unexpected visit by Darth Sidious, who considered Maul's sudden rise to power a threat to his rule, and dueled both him and Opress.

<p>The Inquisitors were an organization of Force-sensitive warriors in the service of the Galactic Empire prior to the events of <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_(film)" title="Star Wars (film)">A New Hope</a></i>, where it is implied that they all became defunct, as Darth Vader and Darth Sidious were the only known Force-wielders at that time. Most of them were former Jedi, who had lost their faith in the Jedi Order and succumbed to the dark side, during or shortly after the Clone Wars. They were all recruited into the Empire and trained by Darth Vader, who tasked them with hunting down other survivors of the Jedi Purge, as well as other Force-sensitive individuals, mostly children, to prevent them from becoming future Jedi. Among the known Inquisitors were: 
</p>
<ul><li><b>The Grand Inquisitor</b> - the individual who would become known as the Grand Inquisitor was a former <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pau%27an" class="mw-redirect" title="Pau&#39;an">Pau'an</a> Jedi Temple Guard.

Offee's speech about the Jedi Order having lost its way due to the Clone Wars, in addition to the fact that the Jedi Council had mistaken <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahsoka_Tano" title="Ahsoka Tano">Ahsoka Tano</a> for the real culprit, eventually made him lose faith in the Jedi as well and embrace the dark side. He later came into service of the Empire and was one of the first-ever Inquisitors recruited to its cause, with the novel <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darth_Vader:_Dark_Lord_of_the_Sith" class="mw-redirect" title="Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith">Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith</a></i> showcasing his first encounter with Darth Vader in the Jedi Temple on Coruscant. Over the years, the Inquisitor worked his way up the Empire's ranks and eventually became the highest-ranking Inquisitor, being tasked (along with his subordinates) with hunting down Force-sensitive children across the galaxy and preventing them from becoming Jedi. The Grand Inquisitor first appeared as the main antagonist of the first season of <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Rebels" title="Star Wars Rebels">Star Wars: Rebels</a></i>, where he was assigned to hunt down <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanan_Jarrus" title="Kanan Jarrus">Kanan Jarrus</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ezra_Bridger" class="mw-redirect" title="Ezra Bridger">Ezra Bridger</a>. He was eventually defeated by Kanan in combat and chose to commit suicide rather than face the infamous wrath of Darth Vader for his failure. A vision of the Grand Inquisitor in his old Jedi Temple Guard attire later appeared to Kanan in the Jedi Temple on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lothal_(Star_Wars)" class="mw-redirect" title="Lothal (Star Wars)">Lothal</a> and dueled him as part of his final trial to become a Jedi Knight.</li>
<li><b>The Second Sister</b> - Trilla Suduri was the Padawan of Jedi Knight Cere Junda and one of the few survivors of the Great Jedi Purge. After Cere was captured and interrogated by the Empire, she betrayed Trilla's location, leading to her being captured and tortured by the Empire as well, until giving into the dark side and becoming the Second Sister Inquisitor. She initially made a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameo_appearance" title="Cameo appearance">cameo appearance</a> in the novel <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darth_Vader:_Dark_Lord_of_the_Sith" class="mw-redirect" title="Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith">Darth Vader: Dark Lord of the Sith</a></i>, and later served as the main antagonist of the video game <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Jedi:_Fallen_Order" title="Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order">Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</a></i>, where she was tasked with hunting Jedi Padawan <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cal_Kestis" class="mw-redirect" title="Cal Kestis">Cal Kestis</a>, as well as a holocron containing a list of Force-sensitive children.

Cere then attempted to make amends with her former Padawan, but Darth Vader appeared and killed Trilla for failing her mission.</li>
<li><b>The Fourth Sister</b> - the Fourth Sister was a mysterious female Inquisitor, who was only alluded in the novel <i>Star Wars Adventures: Return to Vader's Castle</i>.

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Leader_Snoke" title="Supreme Leader Snoke">Snoke</a> was an artificial being created by Darth Sidious and his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sith_Eternal" class="mw-redirect" title="Sith Eternal">Sith Eternal</a> cult on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exegol" class="mw-redirect" title="Exegol">Exegol</a>. After Palpatine's death and the fall of the Empire, Snoke became the Supreme Leader of the First Order and seduced <a href="Kylo_Ren.html" title="Kylo Ren">Ben Solo</a> to the dark side, training him to become his apprentice, <a href="Kylo_Ren.html" title="Kylo Ren">Kylo Ren</a>. Snoke first appeared in <i><a href="Star_Wars%253A_The_Force_Awakens.html" title="Star Wars: The Force Awakens">The Force Awakens</a></i> (2015), where he ordered Ren and the rest of the First Order to find a map that would lead them to <a href="Luke_Skywalker.html" title="Luke Skywalker">Luke Skywalker</a>, the last remaining Jedi; Snoke was responsible for the destruction of Luke's Jedi Order, but Luke himself survived and went into exile, leaving behind only a map as a way to be tracked down. Snoke later sensed an "awakening" in the Force, in the form of the scavenger <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rey_(Star_Wars)" title="Rey (Star Wars)">Rey</a>, the secret granddaughter of Palpatine, who formed a unique Force <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyad_(sociology)" title="Dyad (sociology)">dyad</a> with Ren. After Ren was defeated by Rey in a lightsaber duel and the Resistance destroyed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starkiller_Base" class="mw-redirect" title="Starkiller Base">Starkiller Base</a>, Snoke ordered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Hux" title="General Hux">General Hux</a> to bring Ren to him, to complete his training.
</p><p>In <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_Last_Jedi" title="Star Wars: The Last Jedi">The Last Jedi</a></i>, Snoke reprimanded Hux for his failure as a military leader, following a failed attack on the Resistance's base on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%27Qar" class="mw-redirect" title="D&#39;Qar">D'Qar</a>, and Ren for his failure to find and kill Luke Skywalker, doubting his destiny to succeed Darth Vader. Ren later brought Rey to Snoke, who tortured her for information on Luke's location. He also revealed to Ren and Rey that he had created the psychic bond between them as part of a plan to destroy Luke himself. Snoke then ordered Ren to kill Rey, but he instead sliced Snoke in half, killing him. Shortly after, Ren pinned Snoke's death on Rey and declared himself the new Supreme Leader of the First Order. In <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_Rise_of_Skywalker" title="Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker">The Rise of Skywalker</a></i>, Ren met the resurrected Emperor Palpatine on Exegol, who revealed to him that he had created Snoke as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puppet_ruler" title="Puppet ruler">puppet</a> to lure Ren to the dark side and control the First Order. Ren also observed several clones of Snoke at Palpatine's lair, but Snoke had already served his purpose.

<p><a href="Kylo_Ren.html" title="Kylo Ren">Ben Solo</a> was the son of Rebel Alliance heroes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leia_Organa" class="mw-redirect" title="Leia Organa">Leia Organa</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Solo" title="Han Solo">Han Solo</a>. As the grandson of Anakin Skywalker, the Chosen One, Solo was powerful with the Force from birth and was trained by his uncle Luke Skywalker alongside numerous other Jedi, in an attempt to rebuild the Jedi Order. However, Ben was slowly manipulated by Snoke, the Supreme Leader of the First Order and a powerful master of the dark side of the Force, who made him believe that it was his destiny to succeed Darth Vader and finish what he started: wipe out the Jedi Order. Thus, after Luke sensed the darkness inside him and attempted to kill him in his sleep, Ben turned to the dark side, adopting the <b>Kylo Ren</b> persona, and, following the destruction of Luke's Jedi Order (due to a mysterious dark storm destroying Luke's Jedi Temple and all its inhabitants), joined a mysterious organization of Force-wielding warriors called the Knights of Ren. He eventually killed their leader and replaced him, becoming the new leader of the Knights of Ren, and later a high-ranking commander within the First Order as well. However, unknown to Ren, Luke survived the destruction of his temple and, blaming himself for Ben's fall to the dark side, went into exile on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahch-To" class="mw-redirect" title="Ahch-To">Ahch-To</a>. Ren eventually learned of his uncle's survival and sought to destroy him and the Jedi Order once and for all.
</p><p>In <i><a href="Star_Wars%253A_The_Force_Awakens.html" title="Star Wars: The Force Awakens">The Force Awakens</a></i>, Ren led an attack on a village on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakku" title="Jakku">Jakku</a> in the search of a map that would lead the First Order to Luke, and captured Resistance pilot <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poe_Dameron" title="Poe Dameron">Poe Dameron</a>, who secretly gave the map to his droid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BB-8" title="BB-8">BB-8</a>, which was eventually found by the scavenger Rey. Although Ren learned of this after interrogating Poe with the Force, the latter was liberated by the rogue stormtrooper <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finn_(Star_Wars)" title="Finn (Star Wars)">Finn</a>, who eventually found BB-8 and Rey and they all escaped from Jakku aboard the <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Falcon" title="Millennium Falcon">Millennium Falcon</a></i>, along the way joining up with Ren's father Han Solo and <a href="Chewbacca.html" title="Chewbacca">Chewbacca</a>, who agreed to take them to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takodana" class="mw-redirect" title="Takodana">Takodana</a>, from where they could hand BB-8 over to the Resistance. However, Ren soon learned of this and led another attack on Takodana to retrieve BB-8. Although he failed and the First Order was chased away by the Resistance, Ren instead captured Rey, having sensed that she saw the map, and took her away for interrogation on Starkiller Base. However, Ren failed to extract the information from her and his interrogation instead unlocked her Force abilities. Ren later killed his father to prove his allegiance to the dark side and was defeated by Rey in a lightsaber duel, before being forced to evacuate due to the Resistance destroying Starkiller Base.
</p><p>In <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_Last_Jedi" title="Star Wars: The Last Jedi">The Last Jedi</a></i>, Ren tried to prove himself to Snoke after being defeated by Rey by leading the attack on the Resistance fleet, although he hesitated to kill his mother. He also formed a special Force connection with Rey, through which he revealed to her how Luke had tried to kill him on the night that he turned to the dark side, leading Rey to come to confront Ren, believing that there is still good in him. Ren brought Rey before Snoke, who ordered him to kill her, but he instead killed Snoke and then worked with Rey to defeat his Praetorian Guards. Ren offered Rey to rule the galaxy alongside him and detach herself from the past, claiming that her parents were nobodies, but after she refused, they fought over possession of Luke's lightsaber, which Rey had been using, leading to it being destroyed and Rey escaping. Ren then pinned Snoke's death on Rey and declared himself as the new Supreme Leader of the First Order, before leading an attack on the remains of the Resistance on Crait. After Luke showed up to confront Ren and give the Resistance enough time to escape, Ren fought him, only to discover him to be a Force projection. As Ren screamed in anger, Luke died peacefully on Ahch-To, having used all his remaining energy to project himself on Crait, and the remains of the Resistance escaped aboard the <i>Millennium Falcon</i>.
</p><p>In <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_Rise_of_Skywalker" title="Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker">The Rise of Skywalker</a></i>, Ren tracked down the resurrected Emperor Palpatine to Exegol with the intent of killing him, as he considered him a threat to his reign, but instead learned that Palpatine had been the mastermind behind Snoke all along and had manipulated him to join the dark side. Palpatine then revealed the Sith Eternal fleet — an armada of <i>Xyston</i>-class <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Destroyer" title="Star Destroyer">Star Destroyers</a> equipped with canons capable of decimating entire planets — and offered Ren control of the fleet, thus giving him the means necessary of claiming the galaxy for himself, in exchange for killing his granddaughter, revealed to be none other than Rey. Although Ren accepted, he secretly planned to have Rey join him, so that together they could kill Palpatine and then rule the galaxy together. Ren then managed to track down Rey and her friends to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasaana" class="mw-redirect" title="Pasaana">Pasaana</a> through their Force connection and their confrontation led to Rey using Force lightning to destroy a First Order transporter, which she believed <a href="Chewbacca.html" title="Chewbacca">Chewbacca</a> had been taken prisoner on. Later, Rey and her friends infiltrated Ren's <i>Resurgent</i>-class Star Destroyer <i>Steadfast</i> above <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kijimi" class="mw-redirect" title="Kijimi">Kijimi</a> to rescue Chewbacca after learning that he was still alive, and Ren was once again able to locate Rey through their connection, leading to another confrontation, during which Ren informed her of being Palpatine's granddaughter. Eventually, Rey and Ren dueled on the ocean moon <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kef_Bir" class="mw-redirect" title="Kef Bir">Kef Bir</a>, where the ruins of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Death_Star" class="mw-redirect" title="Second Death Star">second Death Star</a> were located, during which Leia used her last remaining energy to reach out to his son, in an attempt to redeem him, before dying. Distracted, Ren was defeated and fatally injured by Rey, but having sensed Leia's death as well, she quickly used Force heal to treat his injury and then left. Initially confused and conflicted, Ren had a Force vision of his father, similar to the moment when he killed him, but this time Solo convinced his son to abandon the dark side and his Kylo Ren persona, redeeming himself and becoming Ben Solo once again. Ben then came to Exegol to help Rey fight Palpatine, killing the Knights of Ren in the process, but the Emperor sensed the unique Force dyad that the two of them formed and sucked the life energy from them to rejuvenate himself and become the most powerful being in the galaxy. However, Rey was able to summon the spirits of all the past Jedi and kill Palpatine, but died in the process. Ben then used all his remaining life energy to revive her and they shared a kiss, before Ben collapsed to the ground, dying peacefully and becoming one with the Force.

<p>The Knights of Ren were an organization of masked Force-wielding warriors, who were neither Sith or Jedi, but a new generation of dark side warriors that emerged to fill the void left by the supposed demise of the last Sith Lords, Darth Sidious and Darth Vader. They had a code, to which they were flexible in the following: living life the way they wanted, taking what the galaxy gave them, and consuming what the dark side sent them. Their name came from a lightsaber called "Ren", which was at the base of their code and could only be wielded by their leader. The Knights consisted of six individuals named <b>Vicrul</b>, <b>Ap'lek</b>, <b>Cardo</b>, <b>Kuruk</b>, <b>Trudgen</b>, and <b>Ushar</b>, and, prior to the destruction of Luke Skywalker's new Jedi Order, they were led by another individual known simply as "<b>Ren</b>". Some of the Knights were students of Luke, who, similarly to their future leader, Kylo Ren, had lost their faith in the Jedi and succumbed to the dark side. Eventually, after the destruction of Luke's New Jedi Order (although Luke himself survived and went into exile), Ben Solo fell to dark side, before contacting the Knights with the intent of joining them. Eventually, Ben killed Ren and replaced him as the new leader of the Knights of Ren, adopting the name "Kylo Ren". The Knights first appeared in a vision to Rey in <i><a href="Star_Wars%253A_The_Force_Awakens.html" title="Star Wars: The Force Awakens">The Force Awakens</a></i>, but played a more important role in <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_Rise_of_Skywalker" title="Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker">The Rise of Skywalker</a></i>. After Kylo Ren became the new Supreme Leader of the First Order, the Knights became his personal guards and began following him more closely. When Kylo formed an alliance with the resurrected Emperor Palpatine, who ordered him to kill his granddaughter, Rey, the Knights of Ren joined him in his hunt for her and were present during their confrontation on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasaana" class="mw-redirect" title="Pasaana">Pasaana</a>, where they captured <a href="Chewbacca.html" title="Chewbacca">Chewbacca</a>. Later, after Kylo redeemed himself and became Ben Solo once again, the Knights instead swore their loyalty to Palpatine and served as his guards during the final Battle of Exegol, where they were all slaughtered by Ben, marking the end of the Knights of Ren.

</p><p>The Sith feature heavily in many stories of the <i>Star Wars</i> Expanded Universe (EU), appearing in a variety of media created prior to the advent of the 2015 feature film <i><a href="Star_Wars%253A_The_Force_Awakens.html" title="Star Wars: The Force Awakens">Star Wars: The Force Awakens</a></i>.<sup id="cite_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="Sith.html#cite_note-35">&#91;35&#93;</a></sup> Future authors and screenwriters are not required to honor all of the events depicted in this material, but the Expanded Universe has remained a source of creative inspiration. The EU thoroughly details the schism between the dissident “Dark Jedi” and the Jedi establishment that led to the creation of the Sith Order, as well a series of conflicts between the Sith, Jedi and the Galactic Republic spanning the millennia prior to the events of the <i>Star Wars</i> motion picture series, and certain events thereafter.
</p><p>In the EU, the Sith trace their origins to the followers of a dissident Jedi named Ajunta Pall, who endorsed the use of the Dark Side of the Force, contrary to Jedi orthodoxy.<sup id="cite_ref-36" class="reference"><a href="Sith.html#cite_note-36">&#91;36&#93;</a></sup> After Pall and his “Dark Jedi” followers were exiled for their practices, they eventually settled on a planet named Korriban, which was occupied by the "Sith," a red-skinned humanoid race with a high prevalence of Force-sensitives. Over the course of centuries of intermingling between the ethnic Sith and Dark Jedi, the name "Sith" would come to apply to the martial philosophy and political affiliation created by the former Jedi exiles on Korriban, rather than a specific race. This Sith regime would strike out at the Galactic Republic and Jedi on numerous occasions. Notable conflicts between the Sith and the Galactic Republic include the "Great Hyperspace War," in which the Sith would launch a massive invasion of the Republic but succumb to infighting, and the “Sith Holocaust,” in which the Galactic Republic failed in its attempt to exterminate the Sith from known space, leading the Sith survivors to take a vow of eternal vengeance on the Galactic Republic. The EU also describes the exploits of Sith characters following the collapse of Emperor Palpatine's Galactic Empire and the restoration of the Republic, such as the attempt by “Darth Krayt” to establish a New Sith Order on Korriban.

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marka_Ragnos" class="mw-redirect" title="Marka Ragnos">Marka Ragnos</a> was an ancient Sith-human hybrid Sith Lord, who lived during the time of the first Sith Empire, and seized the title of Dark Lord of the Sith, serving as the ruler of the Empire. After his death, two Sith Lords, Naga Sadow and Ludo Kressh, fought to occupy his throne, only for Ragnos' spirit to appear before them and claim that only the most worthy should succeed him. Ragnos lived on as a Force spirit following his death, trapped within his tomb in the Valley of the Dark Lords on Korriban. A thousand years after the Dark Lord's death, Exar Kun summoned Ragnos from his grave through the use of talismans. Ragnos crowned Exar Kun as the new Dark Lord, with Ulic Qel-Droma as Kun's apprentice, as an attempt to resurrect the lost empire thousands of years prior. Several thousands of years after that, in the video game <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Jedi_Knight:_Jedi_Academy" title="Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy">Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy</a></i> (set during the New Republic era), a cult dedicated to Ragnos, led by the Dark Jedi Tavion Axmis, raised as a new threat to the galaxy, with the intent of resurrecting the Sith Lord using an old artifact called the Scepter of Ragnos. After absorbing Force energy from numerous locations across the galaxy using the scepter, Tavion and her cult traveled to Korriban and almost succeeded in resurrecting Ragnos, but were stopped by Luke Skywalker's New Jedi Order. Inside Ragnos' tomb, the Jedi Knight Jaden Korr defeated Tavion, before Ragnos' spirit emerged and possessed her body, attempting to kill the Jedi. However, Jaden was able to defeat Ragnos, whose spirit left Tavion's body and returned to the depths of the Force, swearing revenge against the Jedi.

After decades of torture and being killed and then brought back to life over and over again, Plaugeis finally allowed Venamis to die, having served his purpose. However, he later revived again in the presence of his new apprentice, Darth Sidious, until Venamis' organs finally ceased to function, and he died for the final time.

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darth_Malak" class="mw-redirect" title="Darth Malak">Darth Malak</a> (Alek) is the main antagonist of <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Knights_of_the_Old_Republic" title="Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic">Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</a></i>. Once a Jedi Knight and Revan's best friend, the two of them fought together in the Mandalorian Wars. At some point, Malak was injured in battle and had his entire lower jaw cut off, forcing him to don a prosthetic jaw instead. Later, Malak and Revan unwittingly discovered the Sith Empire in the Unknown Regions and were captured by the Sith Emperor, who, using Sith sorcery, turned them to the Dark Side, but the two broke free from his control and formed their own Sith Empire to wage war on the Republic, with Revan as the leader and Malak as his Sith Apprentice. When Revan prepared to battle the Jedi who boarded his flagship, Malak betrayed him, ordering the ships under his command to fire on Revan's flagship's bridge, so that he could take over the Sith Empire for himself. However, Revan survived the ordeal and was taken to the Jedi Council Enclave, where he had his memory wiped, so that he would become a Jedi once again. Eventually, Revan faced off against Malak, who revealed the truth of his identity, but was ultimately killed in battle by his former friend and Sith Master, which also led to the downfall of his Empire.

Nihilus imbued his dark soul into his mask and robes and had the power to drain the life force out of any living thing. Following the betrayal of his master, Nihilus used the might of the Sith Armada not to conquer planets, but to contain them so that he could "feed" off the Force energy of each planet's lifeforms, wiping planets of life. However, Nihilus was later drawn out and tricked into launching an attack on Telos, believing it to contain the last Jedi. The Exile confronted Nihilus on his ship, and Nihilus was killed either after his former slave Visas sacrificed herself due to their shared link in the Force, or after his attempt to feast on the Exile's connection to the Force backfired and weakened him. Despite his death, Nihilus' soul would continue to live in his mask and robes for millennia to come, as well as inside his own Sith holocron.

<p>Known for much of his 1300-year life as "the Sith Emperor", Lord Vitiate was a sociopathic young lord in one of the earliest iterations of the Sith Empire. When that empire fell, he led an exodus of survivors to the other side of the galaxy to establish a continuation of it, with himself as Emperor. It was Vitiate who corrupted Revan and Malak, but Revan's redemption and Malak's defeat seemingly derailed his plans. Three hundred years after Revan's disappearance, the Emperor launched a surprise attack on the Republic, setting the stage for the video game <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_Old_Republic" title="Star Wars: The Old Republic">Star Wars: The Old Republic</a></i>.

<p>Vindican was a male Dark Lord of the Sith and a member of the Sith species itself, who served the Sith Empire during the Great Galactic War against the Republic. He was the master of Darth Malgus and, alongside him, joined the Sith Empire fleet on the attack of a Republic fleet over Korriban, with the intent of retaking the planet from the Jedi. Aboard the cruiser, Vindican and Malgus dueled a Zabrak Jedi Master named Kao Cen Darach and his apprentice, Satele Shan, but the latter managed to escape, and Vindican was severely injured by Darach. After killing him, Malgus looked down upon his fallen master and, in an act true to the Rule of Two, executed him with his own lightsaber, thus becoming the new Sith Master.

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darth_Malgus" class="mw-redirect" title="Darth Malgus">Darth Malgus</a> (Veradun) was a male human Dark Lord of the Sith and apprentice to Vindican, who served the Sith Empire during the Great Galactic War against the Republic. Following the recapture of Korriban from the Jedi, Malgus killed his master and later led a surprise assault on Alderaan, only to be defeated by his nemesis and former opponent from Korriban, Satele Shan. Malgus was severely injured in the fight against Shan, forcing him to wear a respiratory apparatus for the rest of his life. Sometime later, Malgus was tasked by his superior, Darth Angral, with leading an assault team on the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, which Malgus and his forces destroyed, disgracing the Jedi Order in the eyes of the Republic. Although Malgus believed that the battle of Coruscant was the first step of destroying the Republic, it only served as leverage in the peace negotiations that took place on Alderaan. While the Alderaanian summit progressed, the Sith settled into an occupation of Coruscant. Malgus was placed in charge of orbital security, but the Sith Lord defied his orders and traveled back to Coruscant's surface to strike against the renegade Jedi Aryn Leneer, who wanted to avenge her master Ven Zallow, whom Malgus killed during the attack on the Jedi Temple. Although Leneer ultimately failed, the conflict caused Malgus to become disillusioned with the Empire and to kill his lover Eleena Daru, seeing their relationship as a weakness that prevented him from preserving his own power, which he later used to cleanse the Empire of the politicians whom he blamed for allowing the Republic to survive. During the Cold War years that followed the successful peace negotiations, Malgus led Sith forces into the Unknown Regions, claiming previously-unknown territories for the Empire. Towards the end of the war, following the presumed death of the Sith Emperor and after serving on the Dark Council, Malgus declared his own Empire, free of the infighting of the Dark Council. However, the Republic and the Sith Empire forces soon teamed up to fight against Malgus' Empire and managed to track him down to his secret base he was tracked down to his secret base, where he was defeated. Despite his presumed death, Malgus later resurfaced during the Invasion of Ossus at the start of the Third Galactic War, once again serving as a commander within the Sith Empire. However, following the Battle of Corellia, Malgus went rogue, determined to expunge all physical and mental restraints used to keep him under control. Thousands of years after his death, Malgus was still remembered as one of the most powerful Sith Lords to have ever lived, with Darth Sidious even retrieving some surviving excerpts of Malgus's journals from an antiquities dealer and bounding them into his <i>Book of Sith</i>, an anthology of Sith historical writings.
