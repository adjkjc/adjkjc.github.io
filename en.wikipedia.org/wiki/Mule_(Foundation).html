<p><b>Arcadia "Arkady" Darell</b> is the daughter of Toran Darell II and the granddaughter of Toran and Bayta Darell (and through Bayta is a direct descendant of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hober_Mallow" class="mw-redirect" title="Hober Mallow">Hober Mallow</a>), and becomes famous for writing historical novels and a biography of her grandmother Bayta. At the age of fourteen, she spies on her father and his co-conspirators who are hunting down the Second Foundation. She stows away on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homir_Munn" class="mw-redirect" title="Homir Munn">Homir Munn</a>’s spaceship when he travels to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kalgan_(Foundation_universe)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Kalgan (Foundation universe) (page does not exist)">Kalgan</a> to study the palace of <a href="Mule_(Foundation).html" class="mw-redirect" title="Mule (Foundation)">the Mule</a>. Lord Stettin, who is the ruler of Kalgan, initially refuses Munn’s request to study the Mule’s palace, but soon takes an interest in Arkady as a potential wife. Stettin’s mistress <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Callia" class="mw-redirect" title="Lady Callia">Lady Callia</a> helps Arkady to escape, accidentally revealing herself to be an agent of the Second Foundation and leading Arkady to the location of the Second Foundation.
</p><p>During her escape, Arkady decides to go to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trantor" class="mw-redirect" title="Trantor">Trantor</a> rather than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminus_(planet)" class="mw-redirect" title="Terminus (planet)">Terminus</a>. She has the good luck of running into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preem_Palver" class="mw-redirect" title="Preem Palver">Preem Palver</a> and his wife, who live on Trantor. They help her in her journey, and when they arrive on Trantor, Arkady persuades Palver that he could profitably supply food to Terminus.  Palver takes Arkady's clue to the Second Foundation's location; however, the Second Foundation has been carefully supervising the entire process, and they remain undiscovered on Trantor.
</p><p>Arkady Darell was born in 362 FE (12428 GE) on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trantor" class="mw-redirect" title="Trantor">Trantor</a> near the Imperial Library.<sup id="cite_ref-Asimovsecondfoundation_1-0" class="reference"><a href="Mule_(Foundation).html#cite_note-Asimovsecondfoundation-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup>  The nature of Darell's birth indicates that her mind was tampered with in order to run to completion the Seldon plan.<sup id="cite_ref-Asimovsecondfoundation_1-1" class="reference"><a href="Mule_(Foundation).html#cite_note-Asimovsecondfoundation-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup><sup class="reference" style="white-space:nowrap;">:<span>p. 222</span></sup> Darell's birth was contrived to be on Trantor for an intervention; she was the recipient of a <i>control</i> by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Foundation" title="Second Foundation">Second Foundation</a> as a new-born infant as the emotional bias could remain undetected by brainwave pattern analysis in her blank slate of mind. 
</p><p>Darell's mother died on Trantor three years after her birth in 365.

<p><b>Bail Channis</b> is described as a handsome and popular character, very self-confident and intelligent. <a href="Mule_(Foundation).html#The_Mule">The Mule</a> chooses Channis to accompany General <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Pritcher" class="mw-redirect" title="Han Pritcher">Han Pritcher</a> on a search for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Foundation" title="Second Foundation">Second Foundation</a>. The Mule tells Pritcher that he has chosen Channis for the task because he, the Mule, has chosen not to tamper with Channis's mind, thus leaving Channis more capable of making intuitive leaps which might lead him to his goal. In fact, the Mule has already determined that Channis is a member of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Foundation" title="Second Foundation">Second Foundation</a>, and that he is attempting to lead the Mule into a trap. The Mule intends to use this knowledge to set a trap of his own. He secretly places a hyper tracer on Channis's ship, allowing him and his fleet to follow their progress.
</p><p>Channis leads the search to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_minor_Foundation_universe_planets&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="List of minor Foundation universe planets (page does not exist)"> Tazenda</a>, which is a plausible place for the Second Foundation to be located. Channis and Pritcher visit a world controlled by Tazenda, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_minor_Foundation_universe_planets&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="List of minor Foundation universe planets (page does not exist)">Rossem</a>, where the local elders, members of the Second Foundation, have been expecting them. When they return to their ship, Pritcher also comes to the conclusion that Channis is a member of the Second Foundation, and draws his atomic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raygun" title="Raygun">blaster</a> on him, saying that the Mule would shortly be coming (both men had found the hyper tracer). Channis, however, uses his mental powers to convince Pritcher that he is not a member of the Second Foundation and that he (Pritcher) was being manipulated into killing him by the Second Foundation, who Channis says had planted the hyper tracer. Pritcher, convinced, decides to hand his blaster over to Channis.
</p><p>At that moment, the Mule enters, takes Pritcher's firearm, and reveals that he had followed them and taken the core of his fleet with him to destroy the Second Foundation. In an act of desperation, Channis removes Pritcher's conversion by the Mule, but restrains him so he cannot harm the Mule. Channis then states that if the Mule kills him, Pritcher's bonds will be broken and he will kill the Mule. Defeated, the Mule then proceeds to forcing the location of the Second Foundation out of Channis through mental <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torture" title="Torture">torture</a>. Broken, Channis reveals its location: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_minor_Foundation_universe_planets&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="List of minor Foundation universe planets (page does not exist)">Rossem</a>.
</p><p>However, the Second Foundation springs its trap in a manner which proves a complete surprise to both Channis and the Mule: The Second Foundation has altered Channis' mind so that he honestly believes that Rossem is the Second Foundation, while the rest of the Second Foundation have left their real home world for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kalgan_(Foundation_universe)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Kalgan (Foundation universe) (page does not exist)"> Kalgan</a>, where they will start an insurrection against the Mule. When the <a href="Mule_(Foundation).html#Preem_Palver"> First Speaker</a> of the Second Foundation informs the Mule of this, the Mule is shocked, and lets his defenses down momentarily. The First Speaker takes advantage of this, and mentally alters the Mule so that he no longer seeks to expand his empire. The Mule returns to Kalgan, taking Pritcher with him and leaving Channis with the First Speaker.
</p><p>The First Speaker brings Channis "home", where his "original" mind is restored to him. Channis realizes that he <i>does</i> know the real location of the Second Foundation—to his great surprise.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Bel_Riose">Bel Riose</span><span class="mw-editsection"><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">[</span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_Foundation_series_characters&amp;action=edit&amp;section=6" title="Edit section: Bel Riose">edit</a><span class="mw-editsection-bracket">]</span></span></h2>
<p><b>Bel Riose</b> was the last strong General of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_Empire_(Asimov)" class="mw-redirect" title="Galactic Empire (Asimov)">Galactic Empire</a>, Commander of the legendary Twentieth Fleet, who eventually came to be known as "the Last of the Imperials", and earned this title well. His tactical genius was compared with that of Admiral Peurifoy, and his skill at handling men to be far greater. A man of great military genius, he was also brave, competent, good looking, neither too young nor too old, a taker of calculated risks, and good to his men—in short, he was a popular general. He was born at a late point during the slow fall of the Empire. Riose yearned for the days when generals proved their worth through the addition of new territory to the empire.
</p><p>Riose got his chance when he heard rumors of the "magicians" from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ducem_Barr" class="mw-redirect" title="Ducem Barr">Ducem Barr</a> and others, in reference to the scientists of the Foundation. At this time, the Foundation held a large portion of the periphery in economic control and word of the Foundation was beginning to reach the Empire at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_Core" class="mw-redirect" title="Galactic Core">Galactic Core</a>. As a stalwart and patriotic defender of the original Galactic Empire, Riose was shocked by the legend of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hari_Seldon" title="Hari Seldon">Hari Seldon</a>'s plan to create a new Empire which would take over from his own; the Foundation was a real threat. With several of the last great "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ships_of_the_line" class="mw-redirect" title="Ships of the line">ships of the line</a>", pinnacles of Imperial technological and military prowess (of which few remained in those degenerate times), Riose set out into the barbarian Galactic Periphery to claim the Foundation in the name of Empire and Emperor. Seldon had predicted that the Foundation would survive all trials, and Bel Riose knew this, but he bet his living will against the "dead hand" of Seldon's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychohistory_(fictional)" title="Psychohistory (fictional)">psychohistory</a>. In combat, Riose repeatedly defeated the Foundation through brilliant tactical and strategic planning. Eventually, Riose's fleet came within a day's travel of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminus_(planet)" class="mw-redirect" title="Terminus (planet)">Terminus</a>. Before he could complete his conquest, however, he was recalled by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleon_II" class="mw-redirect" title="Cleon II">Emperor Cleon II</a>, tried for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treason" title="Treason">treason</a>, and executed.
</p><p>All had gone as Seldon predicted. A weak General could clearly never threaten the Foundation due to a lack of adaptability and innovation (the Galactic Empire had begun to stagnate in <i>all</i> things, including military strategy, and could have easily had its pre-planned and often repeated attacks thwarted). A strong General under a weak Emperor would overthrow the Emperor rather than make new conquests since control of the Galactic Empire is obviously more enticing than control over the so-called "barbarian hinterland". Riose, however, served under Cleon II, the last strong Emperor. When both General and Emperor are strong, the General can only keep his attention on outward conquest: that is why Riose was the only Imperial in many years to pose a threat to the Foundation. However, this situation also meant that the strong Emperor would never let the strong general become strong enough to dethrone him. Paranoia ran high in the Galactic Empire due to the staggering number of revolutions and political assassinations. Emperor Cleon II had Riose executed out of fear of his popularity and success. Ironically, General Riose never had any designs upon the throne and never did anything except to serve his Emperor faithfully. According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golan_Trevize" class="mw-redirect" title="Golan Trevize">Golan Trevize</a>, in later years Riose was largely forgotten by the people of the Foundation, as their national mythology required that <a href="Mule_(Foundation).html" class="mw-redirect" title="Mule (Foundation)">the Mule</a> be made the sole central threat to the rise of the Foundation.
</p><p>Asimov loosely based Bel Riose on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belisarius" title="Belisarius">Flavius Belisarius</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="Mule_(Foundation).html#cite_note-2">&#91;2&#93;</a></sup> a great general of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Roman_Empire" class="mw-redirect" title="Eastern Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a> during the 6th century AD. Like Riose, Belisarius served a strong emperor, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justinian_the_Great" class="mw-redirect" title="Justinian the Great">Justinian the Great</a>, in an empire that had declined from its peak (Belisarius was one of the people, along with Justinian, known as "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_last_of_the_Romans" class="mw-redirect" title="The last of the Romans">the last of the Romans</a>", i.e., imperials); helped it to recapture much of its lost territory, including Rome itself; and was called back on baseless suspicion that he was angling for the Imperial throne. Unlike Riose, Belisarius was not executed but retired (and, according to unsubstantiated legend, was blinded and cast out of Constantinople as a beggar).

<p><b>Blissenobiarella</b>, known informally as <b>Bliss</b>, is one of the inhabitants of Gaia. She was first introduced in <i>Foundation's Edge</i> to escort two Foundation men, Golan Trevize and Janov Pelorat, to their reception on planet Gaia. Bliss, like all Gaians, has an enormous affinity for life and can't bear to see life destroyed. She is long distrusted by Trevize while his partner, Pelorat, is quickly fascinated and they become lovers.
</p><p>Particularly in <i>Foundation and Earth</i>, Bliss serves partly as a way of exploring the narrative, as she and Trevize engage in frequent debates. Bliss acts as an advocate for Gaia/Galaxia while Trevize, still somewhat uncomfortable with the decision he makes in <i>Foundations' Edge</i>, argues for individuality. As both an individual and an extension of the Gaia group-mind, Bliss is extremely intelligent and easily able to debate with Trevize, despite his skills as a politician.
</p><p>In <i>Foundation and Earth</i>, Bliss leaves Gaia with the two men, helping them in their search for Earth. Because Bliss is a Gaian, she possesses considerable mentallic powers, which are often used as a plot device in <i>Foundation and Earth</i> to help her companions escape from dangers that they encounter during their quest. She commonly uses her empathic and telepathic powers to help deal with dangerous people and creatures. In addition, she also exhibits psychokinetic abilities as well as the power to help purge others of disease-causing organisms. At the climax of <i>Foundation and Earth</i> she, as an avatar of Gaia, bears witness to Trevize's explanation of why he decided in favor of Galaxia as humanity's best option for future survival.

<p><b>Cleon I</b> was the last <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emperor" title="Emperor">Emperor</a> of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entun_dynasty" class="mw-redirect" title="Entun dynasty">Entun dynasty</a> (11,988 GE – 12,038 GE in the timeline of the novels).  He was Emperor of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_Empire_(Asimov)" class="mw-redirect" title="Galactic Empire (Asimov)">Galactic Empire</a> when <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hari_Seldon" title="Hari Seldon">Hari Seldon</a> first arrived on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trantor" class="mw-redirect" title="Trantor">Trantor</a>.  He succeeded to the Imperial throne in 12,010 GE at the age of twenty-two following the death of his father, Stanel VI, who was fortunate enough to escape the roughly one-in-two chances of assassination faced by the last century of Galactic Emperors.
</p><p>Asimov portrays Cleon as an amiable man, no longer enthusiastic about the trappings of office, eager to treat others as his equals and yet not capable of conversing comfortably&#8212;or even understanding their motivations.  In his genial but misguided well-wishing, he is similar to the portrayal of <a href="Austria.html" title="Austria">Austrian</a> emperor <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_II,_Holy_Roman_Emperor" title="Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor">Joseph II</a> in <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amadeus_(film)" title="Amadeus (film)">Amadeus</a></i> (a film which Asimov admired), although he is not very similar to the historical Joseph II.
</p><p>Arguably, the most significant event of Cleon's rule occurred in 12,020 GE, when the young mathematician Hari Seldon came to Trantor and revealed that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychohistory_(fictional)" title="Psychohistory (fictional)">psychohistory</a> was a theoretical possibility.  Cleon I’s reign represented a curious interval of quiet between troubled times. This is undoubtedly due to the skills of his Chief of Staff, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._Daneel_Olivaw" title="R. Daneel Olivaw">Eto Demerzel</a>. Cleon would never have learned of this development by his own efforts; insulated from the Galaxy and confined to the Imperial Palace's grounds, he relied upon Demerzel to conduct the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machiavelli" class="mw-redirect" title="Machiavelli">Machiavellian</a> maneuvers required to keep the Empire functioning. Demerzel became aware that Seldon could possibly develop a mathematical method for predicting future history, and he (indirectly) informed the Emperor, who took an immediate interest in the matter. While Cleon was content to use Seldon as a source of self-fulfilling prophecies&#8212;a tool to prevent unrest&#8212;Demerzel had come to believe that the Empire itself was dying, and that only an honest investigation could prevent its fall or at least minimize that fall's effects. Therefore, Demerzel took steps to promote Seldon's development of his infant science.
</p><p>After Demerzel's retirement, Cleon appointed Seldon to be his new Chief of Staff, a position now termed First Minister. (<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prelude_to_Foundation" title="Prelude to Foundation">Prelude to Foundation</a></i> states that Demerzel had no formal title, while its sequel, <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_the_Foundation" title="Forward the Foundation">Forward the Foundation</a>,</i> makes him the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Minister" class="mw-redirect" title="First Minister">First Minister</a>) Seldon exerted himself to the fullest, employing pragmatic measures to halt anti-Imperial conspiracies while simultaneously developing psychohistory into a system capable of making solid predictions.
</p><p>Cleon's personal ineptitude became his downfall. Wishing to thank a gardener, Mandel Gruber, for his part in thwarting an assassination attempt on Dr. Seldon, he promoted Gruber to Chief Gardener over the Imperial Palace grounds. Gruber, not wishing to abandon his lifestyle of being out in the open for the Head Gardener's administrative role, had a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_breakdown" class="mw-redirect" title="Mental breakdown">mental breakdown</a> and shot the Emperor. The chaotic upset which followed Cleon's assassination saw the rise of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_dictatorship" title="Military dictatorship">military junta</a> and Hari Seldon's retirement from overt politics.

<p><b>Dors Venabili</b> is a good friend, protector and later wife of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hari_Seldon" title="Hari Seldon">Hari Seldon</a>, the primary character of <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prelude_to_Foundation" title="Prelude to Foundation">Prelude to Foundation</a></i> and <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_the_Foundation" title="Forward the Foundation">Forward the Foundation</a></i>. At face value, Venabili is a woman two years younger than Seldon, in her own words not very good-looking. She tells Seldon that she is a historian from Cinna, and, before her involvement in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prelude_to_Foundation" title="Prelude to Foundation">The Flight</a>, Venabili taught history classes at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streeling_University" class="mw-redirect" title="Streeling University">Streeling University</a> on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trantor" class="mw-redirect" title="Trantor">Trantor</a>.
</p><p>Venabili has been assigned the task of protecting Hari Seldon by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._Daneel_Olivaw" title="R. Daneel Olivaw">Chetter Hummin</a> (one of several aliases used by R. Daneel Olivaw) who takes an initial interest in Hari Seldon's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychohistory_(fictional)" title="Psychohistory (fictional)">psychohistory</a> research. Over the course of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prelude_to_Foundation" title="Prelude to Foundation">Prelude to Foundation</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_the_Foundation" title="Forward the Foundation">Forward the Foundation</a> she shows an obsessive concern for his safety and earns the nickname "The Tiger Woman" for the ferocity with which she is willing to defend him, and her accuracy, reflexes, and skill (all thought to be superhuman to the point of feline). Despite that, throughout her lifetime protecting Seldon, she was always reluctant to harm opponents in the course of protecting her husband. This is a result of her being bound by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Laws_of_Robotics" title="Three Laws of Robotics">Laws of Robotics</a>.
</p><p>Toward the end of <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prelude_to_Foundation" title="Prelude to Foundation">Prelude to Foundation</a></i>, Seldon reveals his suspicion that Venabili is a human-appearing robot working with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._Daneel_Olivaw" title="R. Daneel Olivaw">R. Daneel Olivaw</a> on his mission to protect mankind. (Clues that reveal Venabili's true nature include her learning to master a weapon skillfully and immediately after watching a gangster use it just once.)
A talk with Venabili pretty obviously confirms his supposition, even though the word "robot" is not spoken here. Still, the issue has no apparent effect on Seldon's love for Venabili, and even though she concludes the talk "So you see, Hari. I'm not really what you want." Seldon is unperturbed, thinking about his protectress and future wife in love.
</p><p>Venabili tries to help Seldon also as a historian. Their talks on the former Kingdom of Trantor make Seldon consider the planet as a provisional model for the then still very immature science of psychohistory. Together with Seldon, Venabili raises <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raych_Seldon" class="mw-redirect" title="Raych Seldon">Raych</a>, whom they encounter as a 12-year-old boy while in the Dahl sector of Trantor.
</p><p>Venabili dies in Seldon's arms after being his spouse for 28 years, apparently as a result of both the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetism" title="Electromagnetism"> electromagnetic</a> damage inflicted during the attempt on her life by a traitor in Seldon's ranks, Tamwile Elar, and a violation of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Laws_of_Robotics" title="Three Laws of Robotics">First Law of Robotics</a> as Venabili kills Elar in defense of the Psychohistorical Project, thus essentially choosing to follow the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeroth_law_of_robotics" class="mw-redirect" title="Zeroth law of robotics">Zeroth Law</a> and suffering a fate similar to that of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._Giskard_Reventlov" class="mw-redirect" title="R. Giskard Reventlov">R. Giskard Reventlov</a>. When dying, Venabili confesses to Seldon that thanks to him she felt like a human being.
</p><p>In the original Asimov books, it is unknown if Venabili has been repaired after the damage. In the epilogue of <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_the_Foundation" title="Forward the Foundation">Forward the Foundation</a></i>, Seldon's last word was "Dors!", yet it is not specified, if he met her, or if it is only an exclamation of a man longing for his dead spouse. Venabili reappears only in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Foundation_Series#Other_authors" class="mw-redirect" title="The Foundation Series">The Second Foundation Trilogy</a>, after her apparent death, having been repaired by Daneel. She is originally assigned new duties, but has difficulty adapting to them. Having been built for the specific purpose of caring for Hari Seldon, her absence from his life and her knowledge of his impending death give her new perspective on Daneel's orders. Eventually, she leaves his service entirely, and it is implied that she takes up with the robot <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=R._Lodovik_Trema&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="R.

<p><b>Ebling Mis</b> is the Foundation's greatest <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychologist" title="Psychologist">psychologist</a> and a very prominent scientist. He is described in the book as being "The Scientist—with capital letters and no smile." Because of this, he is allowed a certain lenience in formality when dealing with the government; no disrespect or broken taboo was worth losing his contribution to science. For instance, Mis disregards the usual protocol involved with requesting an audience with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indbur_III" class="mw-redirect" title="Indbur III">Mayor</a>, and instead, he barges into the palace unannounced.
</p><p>Mis is important to the <a href="Mule_(Foundation).html" class="mw-redirect" title="Mule (Foundation)">Mule</a>'s goal of galactic conquest. He is sought out by the Mule and brought along on with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_minor_Foundation_series_characters#Toran_and_Bayta_Darell" class="mw-redirect" title="List of minor Foundation series characters">Toran and Bayta Darrell</a> on their journey, still unaware of the Mule's presence. While on Haven, Mis speculates about the nature of the Mule. He and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Randu&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Randu (page does not exist)">Randu</a> discuss the probability that the Mule is a mutant and if so, what sort of abilities he might have. As they are debating the explanations to the peculiarities that have recently occurred, they come very close to the truth, but they do not realise that even as they speak, Haven is under the influence of the Mule's power. Mis and his companions leave for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trantor" class="mw-redirect" title="Trantor">Trantor</a> to find the location of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Foundation" title="Second Foundation">Second Foundation</a> and a way to defeat the Mule. As they travel, Mis becomes more and more withdrawn. In fact, in the pages leading up to their arrival on Trantor, he is only barely mentioned in the plot. When he is described, it is typically as being in a pensive mood and oblivious to events happening around him. After landing on Trantor his condition worsens considerably.
</p><p>He spends the last few chapters locked in the catalogue rooms of the University, poring over old documents, and frantically trying to uncover the secret location of the Second Foundation. It is later discovered that the Mule was manipulating him into this state of arousal in order to achieve the great insights that would emulate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hari_Seldon" title="Hari Seldon">Hari Seldon</a>'s work. Unfortunately for Mis, this heightened state is fatal, and when he did discover the secret, he was on his deathbed. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toran_and_Bayta_Darell" class="mw-redirect" title="Toran and Bayta Darell">Bayta Darrell</a> sees through the Mule's plan, and she kills Mis with a blaster before he could reveal the location of the other Foundation. Ebling Mis is possibly the only one since Seldon's time to have discovered the secret, but the information died with him, and the truth about the Second Foundation would not be revealed until many years later.

Originally from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Smyrno&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Smyrno (page does not exist)">Smyrno</a>, one of the Four Kingdoms which borders <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminus_(planet)" class="mw-redirect" title="Terminus (planet)">Terminus</a>, Mallow is a freelance trader and considered among the best of his class.  He is sent to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korell" title="Korell">Korell</a> on a mission to discover the fates of three Foundation ships lost in that sector, as well as to investigate the possibility that Korell has developed nuclear technology.   
</p><p>Mallow avoids a trap (a member of the Korellian secret police disguised as a Foundation priest) set by the Commdor of Korell, and arranges for a profitable trade between Korell and the Foundation. When he returns to Terminus, he is accused of being a traitor for not spreading the Foundation's science-based <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientism_(Foundation)" class="mw-redirect" title="Scientism (Foundation)">pseudo-religion</a> and for allowing a Foundation missionary to be killed.  He defends himself successfully at trial, exposing the "missionary" as a member of the Korellian Secret Police. On the back of the resultant publicity, he then wins the mayoral election, becoming the leader of Terminus.  
</p><p>As Mayor, Mallow leads the Foundation through its third <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seldon_Crisis" class="mw-redirect" title="Seldon Crisis">Seldon Crisis</a>.  In this instance, the crisis involved an impending war with Korell and those remnants of the Empire which back them.  Mallow's solution, reminiscent of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvor_Hardin" class="mw-redirect" title="Salvor Hardin">Salvor Hardin</a>'s years before, is to make the Korellian economy (as well as the livelihood of its population) dependent on Foundation merchandise. The “war” ends three years later as one of "the least fought wars in Galactic History", as quoted in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encyclopedia_Galactica" title="Encyclopedia Galactica">Encyclopedia Galactica</a>, and Mallow transforms the power and influence of the Foundation from chiefly religious to primarily economic, turning Terminus into a successful <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plutocracy" title="Plutocracy">plutocracy</a>. 
</p><p>Mallow is implied to be something of a playboy; no wife is mentioned, but he had a number of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mistress_(lover)" title="Mistress (lover)">mistresses</a> throughout his life, none of them named. He fathered at least one illegitimate child, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_minor_Foundation_series_characters#Sennett_Forell" class="mw-redirect" title="List of minor Foundation series characters">Sennett Forell</a>, who was involved in the war against <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bel_Riose" class="mw-redirect" title="Bel Riose">Bel Riose</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_minor_Foundation_series_characters#Bayta_Darell" class="mw-redirect" title="List of minor Foundation series characters">Bayta Darell</a> from <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_and_Empire" title="Foundation and Empire">Foundation and Empire</a></i>, and her granddaughter <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkady_Darell" class="mw-redirect" title="Arkady Darell">Arkady Darell</a> from <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Foundation" title="Second Foundation">Second Foundation</a></i> were also descended from him.
</p><p>In the centuries after, Mallow is remembered as the first of the Merchant Princes, and as a culture hero of Terminus legend.  A Foundation battle-cruiser named for him is destroyed by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kalgan_(Foundation_universe)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Kalgan (Foundation universe) (page does not exist)">Kalganian</a> fleet at the start of the Stettinian War in <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Foundation" title="Second Foundation">Second Foundation</a></i>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golan_Trevize" class="mw-redirect" title="Golan Trevize">Golan Trevize</a> is given a ship named <i>Far Star</i> at the beginning of <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation%27s_Edge" title="Foundation&#39;s Edge">Foundation's Edge</a></i>. He is also remembered during Foundation and Empire due to the fact that his movement toward plutocratic government helped lead to a potential conflict within the Foundation, however the Mule disrupted that occurrence.

<p>Gruber is a dedicated gardener on the grounds of the Imperial palaces on Trantor. Gruber displays his courage when there is an assassination attempt on Seldon, and as a reward, Cleon appoints Gruber Chief Gardener. Gruber panics, afraid of the more demanding task, which would entail administrative work, and flees from his promotion ceremony, which is marred by an unsuccessful assassination attempt on Seldon by political enemies. Gruber attacks Emperor Cleon I at the base of the grand staircase of one of the Imperial palaces, killing the Emperor with a nuclear handgun.  He is subsequently executed.

He is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mentalic" class="mw-redirect" title="Mentalic">mentalic</a> who has the ability to reach into the minds of others and "adjust" their emotions, individually or en masse, using this capability to conscript individuals to his cause. Not direct mind-control per se, it is a subtle influence of the subconscious; individuals under the Mule's influence behave otherwise normally - logic, memories, and personality intact. This gives the Mule the capacity to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seldon_Crisis" class="mw-redirect" title="Seldon Crisis">disrupt Seldon's plan</a> by invalidating <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hari_Seldon" title="Hari Seldon">Seldon's</a> assumption that no single individual could have a measurable effect on galactic socio-historical trends on their own, due to the plan relying on the predictability of the actions of very large numbers of people.
</p><p>From the book "Foundation's Edge" we learn that Mule is from planet Gaia. The Mule establishes his empire incrementally, using past conquests to aid new ones: first by mentally converting a pirate band to his allegiance, then a whole planet, then the militarily powerful kingdom of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kalgan_(Foundation_universe)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Kalgan (Foundation universe) (page does not exist)">Kalgan</a>, which he obtains by mentally converting the warlord of the planet Kalgan, and then the Foundation. The Mule sets up his own short-lived <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_Empire_(Asimov)" class="mw-redirect" title="Galactic Empire (Asimov)">Galactic Empire</a>, the "Union of Worlds", styling himself "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augustus" title="Augustus">First Citizen</a> of the Union" and making Kalgan its capital planet. Leading up to, during, and for a good time after the Mule's conquest of the Foundation and its trade confederacy, almost no one ever actually sees the Mule or knows what he looks like.
</p><p>The Foundation, after the death of the Empire, is the sole supplier of nuclear weaponry in the galaxy, and using this asset the Mule begins rapidly conquering surrounding territories, all of which lack nuclear power, sweeping aside the remnants of the Galactic Empire centered on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neotrantor" class="mw-redirect" title="Neotrantor">Neotrantor</a>.
</p><p>The Mule's conquest is amazingly fast: he defeats the Foundation and establishes the Union of Worlds after only five years. Then, just as suddenly, and seemingly randomly, he stops his advance and settles into a five-year period of consolidation. This is actually because the Mule fears the mysterious <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Foundation" title="Second Foundation">Second Foundation</a>, which is rumoured to be capable of defeating a mentalic individual like himself. According to a hint given by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hari_Seldon" title="Hari Seldon">Hari Seldon</a>, the Second Foundation was founded at "the opposite end of the galaxy" from the First Foundation, which was itself founded on the distant galactic rim planet <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminus_(planet)" class="mw-redirect" title="Terminus (planet)">Terminus</a>. However, the true location of the Second Foundation is a total mystery and popular sentiment is that it does not exist. Nevertheless, the Mule launches repeated expeditions in search of the Second Foundation during this period of consolidation.
</p><p>These expeditions, particularly the last, led by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Pritcher" class="mw-redirect" title="Han Pritcher">Han Pritcher</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bail_Channis" class="mw-redirect" title="Bail Channis">Bail Channis</a>, are very nearly successful. Ultimately, however, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Foundation" title="Second Foundation">Second Foundation</a> succeeds in defeating the Mule, transforming him into a relatively harmless individual lacking ambition, and ending his threat to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seldon_Plan" class="mw-redirect" title="Seldon Plan">Seldon Plan</a>.
</p><p>The Mule's name is a reference to the sterility of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mule" title="Mule">mules</a>, since he too is genetically sterile. Without a child available as a successor, the Mule's empire ends soon after his death.  No reference is ever given about any other name for him besides "The Mule", a name he apparently gave himself, and 'Magnifico Giganticus', an alias he takes up to travel among Foundationers (in that role, he also claims his name used to be Bobo). In <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Foundation" title="Second Foundation">Second Foundation</a></i>, it is revealed that the Mule dies in his thirties as a result of poor health. His childhood is one of torment and alienation. The Mule becomes aware of his great mental powers in his twenties, and develops a desire to compensate for his earlier life by taking revenge on humanity.
</p><p>The Mule is a central character in <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_and_Empire" title="Foundation and Empire">Foundation and Empire</a></i> and <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Foundation" title="Second Foundation">Second Foundation</a></i>. <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation%27s_Edge" title="Foundation&#39;s Edge">Foundation's Edge</a></i> reveals that he originally came from the planet <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gaia_(Foundation_universe)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Gaia (Foundation universe) (page does not exist)">Gaia</a>, but was regarded as an aberration on a world where mental powers were being developed for benevolent ends.
</p><p>According to his autobiography <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Memory_Yet_Green" class="mw-redirect" title="In Memory Yet Green">In Memory Yet Green</a></i>, Asimov modeled the Mule's physical appearance on Leonard Meisel, a friend at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>-era Navy Yard in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philadelphia" title="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>.

<p><b>Preem Palver</b> is portrayed as a rather loud and jolly simple farmer. However, in reality he is the mastermind behind the plot to restore <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hari_Seldon" title="Hari Seldon">Hari Seldon</a>'s plan to its original course after the disruption by the <a href="Mule_(Foundation).html" class="mw-redirect" title="Mule (Foundation)">Mule</a>. This required meticulous planning, giving the Foundation a believable solution to the enigma of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Foundation" title="Second Foundation">Second Foundation</a>. Preem Palver is the nineteenth <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Speaker" class="mw-redirect" title="First Speaker">First Speaker</a> of the Second Foundation and direct descendant of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stettin_Palver" class="mw-redirect" title="Stettin Palver">Stettin Palver</a>, another character in the <i>Foundation</i> universe. (In fact, Palver's name seems to mean "First Speaker"; Preem sounds like prime and Palver sounds like palaver. This is probably meant as a foreshadowing hint to the reader, since his identity as First Speaker is not revealed until the last sentence of <i>Second Foundation.</i>)
</p><p>He and his wife were leaving <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kalgan_(Foundation_universe)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Kalgan (Foundation universe) (page does not exist)">Kalgan</a> where they had negotiated a trade agreement. They met up with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkady_Darell" class="mw-redirect" title="Arkady Darell">Arkady Darell</a> who was fleeing from Lord Stettin, the ruler of Kalgan, at the spaceport. They helped her evade capture and took her to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trantor" class="mw-redirect" title="Trantor">Trantor</a>, his homeworld. Arkady then solved the riddle of the Second Foundation's location in a believable answer, and used Palver to pass it on to her father <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toran_Darell_II" class="mw-redirect" title="Toran Darell II">Toran Darell II</a> in a coded message: "A circle has no end".  This implied that the Second Foundation was on Terminus, because Hari Seldon had said that the Foundations were at "opposite ends of the Galaxy", and the Galaxy is a flat disc.
</p><p>Preem Palver arranged for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kalgan_(Foundation_universe)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Kalgan (Foundation universe) (page does not exist)">Kalgan</a> to declare war on the Foundation through his agent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Callia" class="mw-redirect" title="Lady Callia">Lady Callia</a>, who was mentally manipulating Kalgan's ruler, Lord Stettin. Kalgan lost the war, and so restored the Foundation's confidence in its purpose. In his guise as a farmer/trader, he also negotiated to supply the Foundation with needed supplies at the close of the war, at which time he passed on Arkady's message.  Dr. Darell, in the meantime, had pioneered an electronic "Mind Static" device that emitted a strong mental field using the brain's radio-wave composition.  Successfully finding an undercover agent of the Second Foundation among them, Dr. Darell and his associates interrogate him and find the Second Foundation on Terminus. The Second Foundation is then "eradicated" by the First Foundation, which now believes itself to be the only Foundation left, and can establish the second galactic empire without interference. 
</p><p>It is later revealed by Preem Palver, in the last chapter, that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminus_(planet)" class="mw-redirect" title="Terminus (planet)">Terminus</a>, the homeworld of the Foundation, is not, in fact, the real location of the Second Foundation.  The physical scientists of the First Foundation were fooled by Seldon's phrasing, "opposite end of the Galaxy" and "Stars End".  They believed that Seldon's meaning was the physical opposite end, but Seldon was a social scientist.  The social opposite end of the Galaxy from Terminus was Trantor, because Trantor was where the entire First Empire was governed from, while Terminus was an impoverished, abandoned planet on the Outer Rim. As a quote from the novel reads <b>"All roads lead to Trantor, and that is where all stars end"</b>. A small group of Second Foundationers was dispatched to Terminus from Trantor in order to fool the physical scientists into thinking that the real Second Foundation was there, and has been defeated. This ensures a return to the original Seldon Plan, where the Second Foundation is not a force to be feared by the First Foundation.
</p><p>One of Preem Palver's most noted accomplishments is his exemplary guiding of the Second Foundation through the crisis.  Seldon's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychohistory_(fictional)" title="Psychohistory (fictional)">psychohistory</a> was useful only when dealing with large groups, so Palver had to rely on manipulation of individuals, whose behavior cannot be predicted statistically with such high confidence.

He proves a trustworthy guide and maintains his new-found loyalty when he and Hari and Dors are captured and taken to Wye sector to meet Rashelle, Mayor of Wye. Out of gratitude for his loyalty, Seldon and Venabili adopt Raych. He gets an education, which he has thus far been denied, and later enters Streeling University. It is implied, but not explicitly stated, that Raych possesses latent mentalic powers, which re-appear with greater force in his daughter Wanda.
</p><p>Eight years after his adoption by Hari and Dors, rising politician <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Foundation_series_characters#Laskin_Joranum" title="List of Foundation series characters">Laskin Joranum</a> threatens to overthrow the Empire. Seldon recognises the danger and persuades Raych to join his organisation and become a follower of Joranum. Raych's plan is to persuade Joranum that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eto_Demerzel" class="mw-redirect" title="Eto Demerzel">Eto Demerzel</a> is actually a robot and Joranum believes this story, using it in his publicity campaign. When the Emperor learns of the claim, and Demerzel publicly denies it, Joranum is exposed. On Seldon's advice, he is exiled to where he claimed to come from, the backwater planet of Nishaya. At this point, Demerzel leaves his post as First Minister, and invites Seldon to replace him.
</p><p>Ten years later, Joranum's former follower, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gambol_Deen_Namarti&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Gambol Deen Namarti (page does not exist)">Gambol Deen Namarti</a>, has restarted the conspiracy under the leadership of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gleb_Andorin&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Gleb Andorin (page does not exist)">Gleb Andorin</a>, planning that he will become First Minister with Andorin as Emperor. Seldon sends Raych to join the Joranumite movement under an alias. But he is recognised  and drugged with 'desperance', a drug which induces depression and reduces his willpower. He is forced to obey orders. He is infiltrated into a group of newly recruited gardeners for the grounds of the Imperial palace, and forced to use a blaster on his father, Hari Seldon. Manella Dubanqua, an undercover security officer working within the Joranumite organisation, saves Raych by killing Andorin; Raych is saved from having to kill his father.
</p><p>Raych marries Manella; they have two children, Wanda and Bellis. As Hari Seldon starts losing funding for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seldon_Plan" class="mw-redirect" title="Seldon Plan">Seldon Project</a> at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streeling_University" class="mw-redirect" title="Streeling University">Streeling University</a>, Raych moves to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Santanni_University&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Santanni University (page does not exist)">Santanni University</a>.

<p><b>Salvor Hardin</b> is the first mayor of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminus_(planet)" class="mw-redirect" title="Terminus (planet)">Terminus City</a>, the sole inhabited location on the planet Terminus. In the novel, Terminus is settled by a colony of scientists and professionals, the Encyclopedic Foundation, working on compiling human knowledge into a compendium called the <i>Encyclopedia Galactica</i>, a project that hides the true meaning of the colony, which is meant by its founder <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hari_Seldon" title="Hari Seldon">Hari Seldon</a> to outlast the inevitable fall of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_Empire_(Asimov)" class="mw-redirect" title="Galactic Empire (Asimov)">Galactic Empire</a> and preserve the sciences through the dark age that must follow.  Seldon is noted to have been aware of this future due to the tenets of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychohistory" title="Psychohistory">psychohistory</a>, a science originally formulated by Seldon himself.
</p><p>The colony is, in its first decades, managed by the Foundation's Board of Trustees, whose members are prominent scientists but poor administrators.  Hardin, born on Terminus, is elected mayor and is given the responsibility of managing the city's day-to-day affairs.  Finding that his role in the city government is undermined by elements of the Board, Hardin launches a popular campaign that demands city representation at Board meetings, and is reluctantly granted the privilege of attending.  
</p><p>Portrayed as a shrewd, manipulating politician, Hardin eventually realizes the true intentions of Hari Seldon in forming the Foundation, but his beliefs and subsequent claims are derided by the members of the Board of Trustees, who attempt to remove him from his new position of power.  Outmaneuvering them through, among other means, his control of the <i>Terminus City Journal</i>, Hardin simultaneously manages to defuse a crisis arising between the Foundation and the neighboring kingdom of Anacreon, which has seceded from the crumbling Galactic Empire.  His beliefs are proven correct after a recording of Hari Seldon is played after the passing of the "First Seldon Crisis"; he then is able to assume the role of the Foundation's <i>de facto</i> head of state.<sup id="cite_ref-Foundation_9-0" class="reference"><a href="Mule_(Foundation).html#cite_note-Foundation-9">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> 
</p><p>After the crisis, Hardin and his chief advisor, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yohan_Lee" class="mw-redirect" title="Yohan Lee">Yohan Lee</a>, devise a method of subjugating the neighboring interplanetary kingdoms, who have neglected the sciences and are regressing into a state reminiscent to <a href="Feudalism.html" title="Feudalism">feudalism</a>.  Creating a religion, called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientism_(Foundation)" class="mw-redirect" title="Scientism (Foundation)">Scientism</a>, which treats scientific occurrences as sacred events, Hardin and Lee send priests—truly, technicians—to the "Four Kingdoms" adjacent to the Foundation's territory in the Terminus system.  This plan is successful, and, as the Foundation's power grows, Hardin is returned to office numerous times.  
</p><p>The second Seldon Crisis arises during Hardin's mayoralty but several decades later, when <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Anacreon_(planet)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Anacreon (planet) (page does not exist)">Anacreon</a>, under <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Regent_Wienis" class="mw-redirect" title="Prince Regent Wienis">Prince Regent Wienis</a>, expands the Anacreonian fleet using a spaceship remodeled by Foundation "priests".  Using the masses’ belief in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_(Isaac_Asimov_novel)" class="mw-redirect" title="Foundation (Isaac Asimov novel)">Foundation</a>’s “religion” against Wienis, Hardin defeats the prince regent, who commits suicide, and the young King of Anacreon signs a treaty with clauses favorable to the Foundation.<sup id="cite_ref-Foundation_9-1" class="reference"><a href="Mule_(Foundation).html#cite_note-Foundation-9">&#91;9&#93;</a></sup> Hardin demonstrates significant advances in Foundation technology when he wears a personal force field to deflect the fire emitted from a nuclear handgun; force fields small enough to be mobile, such as this one, had not yet been seen in the history of the Galactic Empire.

<p><b>Tamwile Elar</b> is a senior mathematician working on the Seldon Project. The creator of 'the achaotic equations' that make it more possible to get around the problem of chaos and aid in developing psychohistory, Seldon thinks of him as a brilliant man, though is sometimes a bit begrudging or annoyed internally because he thinks of himself as no longer as good as he used to be, as he ages, and dislikes Elar's loud laugh and habit of calling Seldon 'the Maestro.' Elar designs an 'Electro-Clarifier' device to allow more information to be stored in 'Prime Radiants' that hold psychohistorical equations. However, whilst collaborating with the military <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_junta" title="Military junta">junta</a> that rules Trantor, he kills <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dors_Venabili" class="mw-redirect" title="Dors Venabili">Dors Venabili</a> with an intense Electro-Clarifier through its side effect of creating an electromagnetic field that damages the electromagnetic machinery of robots without harming humans.  It seems Elar wants to become the head of the Psychohistory Project, and the junta wants Seldon out of the picture so he cannot decry their government as failing, but feels Dors would be difficult to get past. However, Elar does not appear to especially dislike Seldon, and perhaps is even glad that Seldon might drift away with Dors' death without having to be killed by the junta. Dors nevertheless manages to kill Elar and tell Seldon what has happened before dying.
