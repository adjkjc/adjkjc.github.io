<ul><li><b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_%22Ender%22_Wiggin" class="mw-redirect" title="Andrew &quot;Ender&quot; Wiggin">Andrew "Ender" Wiggin</a></b> is the protagonist of the Ender quintet and a constant presence in the Bean quartet. Brought into the International Fleet's Battle School for his immense potential as a commander of soldiers, he is eventually tricked into prosecuting the war against the <a href="Formics.html" class="mw-redirect" title="Formics">Formics</a>, resulting in the almost-complete destruction of that race, and spends a good part of the remainder of his life attempting to find absolution for his unknowing act of <a href="Xenocide.html" title="Xenocide">xenocide</a> by becoming a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_for_the_Dead" title="Speaker for the Dead">Speaker for the Dead</a>.</li>
<li><b><span id="Peter"></span><span id="Peter_Wiggin">Peter Wiggin</span></b> is Ender's elder brother. A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisocial_personality_disorder" title="Antisocial personality disorder">sociopath</a>, he takes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadistic_personality_disorder" title="Sadistic personality disorder">sadistic</a> pleasure in manipulating and brutalizing other children, especially Ender whom Peter loves bullying by looking into his eye, and is rejected from Battle School because he is too violent. In <i>Ender's Game</i>, he helps end a global war (with Valentine's reluctant assistance). In later books, he becomes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hegemon" class="mw-redirect" title="Hegemon">Hegemon</a> of the free world due to his prescient and charismatic leadership, and founds the Free People of Earth, the Enderverse's first world government.</li>
<li><b><span id="Valentine_Wiggin"></span><span id="Valentine">Valentine</span> Wiggin</b> is Ender's elder sister, being the middle child of the Wiggin family. Rejected from Battle School for her overwhelming compassion, she serves as the intermediary between Ender and Peter during the former's childhood. Later she helps Peter on his rise to power by becoming "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demosthenes" title="Demosthenes">Demosthenes</a>", an essayist whose rabble-rousing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demagogue" title="Demagogue">demagoguery</a> is contrasted strongly against Peter's statesmanlike essays as "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Locke" title="John Locke">Locke</a>". After the end of the Formic War, she leaves with Ender on an odyssey through time and space, turning Demosthenes into a historian whose essays are considered the definitive word on whatever subject they address. After marrying on the planet Trondheim, she eventually uproots her family to follow Ender to Lusitania, where she helps to defuse the onrushing Lusitania Fleet and the impending shadow of xenocide.</li>
<li><b><span id="John_Paul"></span><span id="John_Paul_Wiggin">John Paul Wiggin</span></b> and <b><span id="Theresa"></span><span id="Teresa"></span><span id="Theresa_Wiggin">Theresa Wiggin</span></b> are Ender's parents. While <i>Ender's Game</i> portrays them as being dull and oblivious, despite the genius children they raised, both characters are fleshed out in later works and revealed to be more intelligent than even their children imagined. John Paul is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic" class="mw-redirect" title="Catholic">Catholic</a> and Theresa <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mormon" class="mw-redirect" title="Mormon">Mormon</a>. Furthermore, Colonel Graff revealed that Ender's father was baptized with the surname Wieczorek, hinting at his Polish roots, and was born the seventh of nine children, a serious offense in the Enderverse's overpopulation sanctions, both of which he has cast himself away from.</li></ul>

<p>Ender's jeesh (an Arabic word meaning 'army') is a collection of his closest friends at Battle School, particularly those who serve under him in Dragon Army in Battle School before serving as team leads under his command during the Third Invasion, ending with the destruction of the Formic homeworld. As chronicled in the Bean Quartet, many of them move into positions of international significance during the chaotic years after the end of the Formic War, particularly due to the machinations of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles_de_Flandres" class="mw-redirect" title="Achilles de Flandres">Achilles de Flandres</a>.
</p>
<ul><li><b><span id="Alai">Alai</span></b> (pronounced <i>ah-lie</i>) is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muslim" class="mw-redirect" title="Muslim">Muslim</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Africa" title="North Africa">North African</a> descent. In Battle School, he was an exceptional student, adroit in the battle room, and was one of the first children to befriend Ender, with the word "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-L-M" class="mw-redirect" title="S-L-M">salaam</a>" and a kiss on the cheek.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="The_Hive_Queen.html#cite_note-1">&#91;1&#93;</a></sup> They became the best of friends. He also helped lead the special training sessions Ender conducted, and later became one of the most trusted members of Ender's jeesh during the Third Invasion due to his innate talent. After his return to Earth, he is eventually elected <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caliph" class="mw-redirect" title="Caliph">Caliph</a> of a unified Muslim world.</li>

Though the smallest and youngest member of the jeesh, he is also the smartest and most fair-minded person. Ender initially notes that he is isolating Bean as Ender himself was once isolated, in order to force Bean to flourish. Though nothing more than a supporting character in <i>Ender's Game</i>, Bean (real name Julian Delphiki II) is the lead character of the parallel storyline book series known as the "Bean Quartet" or "Shadow Quartet", revealing his role as the behind-the-scenes facilitator of most of the main events of that time period (the victory against the Formics, the uniting of Earth under <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Wiggin" class="mw-redirect" title="Peter Wiggin">Peter Wiggin</a>, so on); being "behind the scenes" is a central theme in these works.</li>
<li><b><span id="Dink_Meeker"></span><span id="Dink">Dink</span> Meeker</b> is a Battle School student of Dutch descent. He is portrayed as one of those who refuses to play the teacher's game. He says that he was offered command of an army twice, but refused to play. He was paranoid of the game, convinced that the teachers were the enemy and that the Bugger War was fake so that all children with ability for command were in the hands of the International Fleet; however, he loved the game, so he stayed as a toon leader.</li>
<li><b><span id="Carn">Carn</span> Carby</b> is an <a href="Australia.html" title="Australia">Australian</a> veteran who commands Rabbit Army. In the original short story version of <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ender%27s_Game" title="Ender&#39;s Game">Ender's Game</a></i>, Ender held a low opinion of him: in the novel, when Bean was transferred into Rabbit Army, Ender says, "How can they put you under an idiot like Carby!", but in the expanded novel Ender's reply is, "Carby's a good man; I hope he recognizes you for what you're worth." Carby's Rabbit Army were the first to battle Ender's Dragon Army and were beaten badly.  When Carby told the other commanders of Ender's new tactics, they didn't believe him, so Carby told Ender "to beat the snot out of them" in battle, as a personal favor. His honest and sympathetic behavior made Ender "mentally [add] him to his private list of people who also qualified as human beings". He is transferred to Command School and serves under Ender during the Third Invasion, one of the few Jeesh members who was never in an army with Ender during Battle School.</li>
<li><b><span id="Tom"></span><span id="Crazy_Tom">Crazy Tom</span></b> is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">British</a> student. He is a veteran soldier who leads "C" Toon in Dragon Army.  He got his nickname due to his temperament, as he couldn't stand to work under commanders that he considered to be stupid. He wrecked rooms and once sent a message to every kid in the school about how bad his commander was.</li>
<li><b><span id="Dumper">Dumper</span></b> is the leader of "E" toon in Dragon Army. He is described by Bean as being among the most worshipful of Ender.  Along with the other toon leaders, he is part of Ender's "jeesh", the group that works under Ender in fighting the Formics.</li>

He is portrayed initially as being contemptuous of Ender's five-toon formation, but later accepts it as wise, after arguing the concept with Bean. He was acting blatantly insubordinate and saying that it was a real "loser strategy", and when Bean stood up for Ender, who was at the time a very young commander, he got mad and almost hurt Bean, but finally he had to accept that Bean was smarter than him and that it was a good strategy.</li>
<li><b><span id="Tzu"></span><span id="Hot_Soup"></span><span id="Han_Tzu">Han Tzu</span></b> (nicknamed <b>Hot Soup</b>) was a veteran soldier from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China" title="China">China</a> who leads "D" Toon in Dragon Army.

During the Earth's invasion of the Bugger worlds, Ender relies on her heavily, often giving her complicated and critical assignments; she is the first student to burn out, falling asleep during a battle. She is a major character later on in the Shadow Series. She and Bean travel around the world, to stay alive, and eventually get married. Together they have children (nine embryos, one implanted in Petra and the other eight were stolen by Achilles; all but one are recovered by the end of Shadow of the Giant) and facilitate the downfall of Achilles.</li>

Ender steps in and sends a number of messages under pseudonyms (such as "Cover your butt.  Bernard is watching. - God") to break Bernard's control over the room.

<li><b><span id="Bernard">Bernard</span></b> is part of Ender's launch group and treats the precocious <a href="Ender_Wiggin.html" title="Ender Wiggin">Ender</a> with great contempt (mostly because Ender had broken Bernard's arm on the shuttle to the Battle School). Bernard is also seen as a ringleader and the main antagonist in the first few chapters of the book, and he takes great delight in picking on Ender and Shen, a young boy who is also in the launchy group. However, his stranglehold on the clique falls apart when Ender and <a href="The_Hive_Queen.html#Alai">Alai</a> become friends in the battle room, and after Ender manages to hack into the computer system and posts a message saying "Cover your butts, Bernard is watching", signed "<a href="God.html" title="God">God</a>".

In their hopes for a child, Elena had several eggs taken out, and Julian's sperm was harvested to produce numerous fertilized eggs.

<li><b><span id="Bonzo"></span><span id="Bonzo_Madrid">Bonzo Madrid</span></b> is an antagonistic supporting character, serving to bring out Ender's brutal nature while at Battle School. Bonzo, whose real name is Bonito de Madrid, is described as a strikingly beautiful boy of aristocratic Spanish lineage from the town of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartagena,_Spain" title="Cartagena, Spain">Cartagena</a>. As commander of Salamander Army, the autocratic Bonzo suddenly has <a href="Ender_Wiggin.html" title="Ender Wiggin">Ender Wiggin</a> thrust upon him when Ender is promoted from his launch group. He is accidentally killed in a confrontation with Ender, bringing six students with him to attack Ender in a bathroom.

<li><b>Talo Momoe</b> is the commander of one of the numerous armies at Battle School. He is paired up with William Bee's army in a battle against Ender's undefeated Dragon Army. Momoe favors a very direct approach, and argues with Bee that, because they outnumber Ender, they should do a frontal assault. Bee's disagreement leads to a prolonged war of words. After Ender comes out with a formation, Momoe orders his army to rebound and assault the army directly.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="The_Hive_Queen.html#cite_note-4">&#91;4&#93;</a></sup></li>

Rose de Nose treats Ender with considerably more decency than does <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonzo_Madrid" class="mw-redirect" title="Bonzo Madrid">Bonzo Madrid</a>, the commander of Ender's first army, Salamander Army. He is also much more lax about rules; the Rat Army barracks are messy when compared to the discipline and order of Salamander. Rose attempts to impose rules on Ender, but <a href="The_Hive_Queen.html#Dink_Meeker">Dink Meeker</a> tells Ender not to listen. As a result, Rose sends Ender out on what is, in essence, a suicide run at the beginning of Ender's first battle with Rat Army so that he will get immediately frozen. Instead, due to his unique "legs first" strategy, he is able to disable or freeze many of the enemies' soldiers to give Rat Army a sizable advantage. Rose gives up picking on Ender, and leaves him to do things his own way. By the time Ender and his group of companions rise to prominence, Rose de Nose has already graduated from Battle School.</li>
<li><b><span id="Pol_Slattery">Pol Slattery</span></b> is a recurring commander that Ender twice faces at Battle School.

What everyone expected to be an easy battle turned into an upset by Slattery. Ender, who had been given orders by Bonzo to stay in the corridor until four minutes after everyone had gone through and then stay in the corner of the battle room, begins to observe Slattery's strategies and is impressed. Despite being young, Slattery is sharp and has new ideas; he always keeping his army moving against the stolid Salamanders who are unable to adapt to the situation. Eventually Leopard annihilates the entire Salamander Army, not including Ender. When Slattery is about to send his remaining men to open the gates, Ender ambushes them and takes out enough men to end the game in a draw. Despite helping Salamander Army achieve a tie, Bonzo is furious at Ender for disobeying his orders and would later cause more troubles for Ender.</li>

He is sent out into space to greet Valentine Wiggin and her family, and later becomes a key player in the events leading up to the almost-second Xenocide.</li>
<li><b>Ela</b> (Eh-la; Ekaterina Elanora Ribeira von Hesse, b. 1952) is Novinha's second child. Like all the females in her line, she becomes a xenobiologist, and is one of the first members of the Ribeira family to warm to Ender. Later in life, she is instrumental in the destruction of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descolada" class="mw-redirect" title="Descolada">descolada virus</a>, and its replacement with a far-more-benign variant, the <i>recolada</i>.</li>
<li><b>Quim</b> (KEENG; Estevão Rei Ribeira von Hesse; b.1955) is Novinha's third child. He is extremely pious and at first resists Andrew Wiggin on grounds of his <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheist" class="mw-redirect" title="Atheist">atheistic</a> avocation, but later warms to the Speaker, partially for his reputation as a crusader. He later becomes the first Christian evangelist to the pequeninos and holds great respect among them, but is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martyr" title="Martyr">martyred</a> by a particularly heretical forest who believe that the descolada is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Ghost" class="mw-redirect" title="Holy Ghost">Holy Ghost</a> and it is the pequeninos' duty to judge all humans with it.</li>
<li><b>Olhado</b> (ol-YAH-doe; Lauro Suleimão Ribeira von Hesse, b. 1958) is Novinha's fourth child. He is also called "the guy with the eyes", because a freak <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser" title="Laser">laser</a> accident blinded him in his youth, requiring the implant of metal replacements. He has reduced <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binocular_vision" title="Binocular vision">binocular vision</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth_perception" title="Depth perception">depth perception</a> but can plug a computer jack directly into one eye, to upload visual recordings. Due to the resulting ostracism, he becomes a keen observer of human nature and interaction. Later in life he becomes a brickmaker (or at least a manager of them) because, to him, <a href="Family.html" title="Family">family</a> is a far more important calling than the sciences that took his relatives; nonetheless he has revolutionary ways of looking at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics" title="Physics">physics</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics" title="Metaphysics">metaphysics</a>, and is crucial in the development of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faster-than-light_travel" class="mw-redirect" title="Faster-than-light travel">faster-than-light travel</a> (via a modified <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace_(science_fiction)" class="mw-redirect" title="Hyperspace (science fiction)">hyperspace</a> mechanic related to philotic theory).  Like Ela, he quickly warms to Ender; as he relates to Valentine in <i>Xenocide</i>, his greatest secret is that, while alone with Ender, they call each other "Father" and "Son".</li>
<li><b>Quara</b> (KWA-rah; Lembrança das Milagres de Jesus Ribeira von Hesse, 1963) is Novinha's fifth child. Throughout her life she exhibits stubbornness and contrariness, generally doing whatever the people who love her <i>don't</i> want her to do. She also becomes a xenobiologist, and assists Ela in "truncating" the descolada, despite discovering that the virus is quite possibly sentient and is certainly able to communicate with other individuals of its species.</li>
<li><b>Grego</b> (GRE-goe; Gerão Gregorio Ribeira von Hesse, b. 1964) is Novinha's sixth child, only six years old when Ender arrives. As a child he showed a disturbing capacity for destruction, modeled on his father's habit of domestic violence, a temper which does not subside during later years. After Quim's death, he attempts to whip a mob into a frenzy to attack the responsible forest, only to have them jump on the nearest one to hand Human and Rooter's forest after being chewed out by Valentine, Grego tries to end the massacre with as little bloodshed as possible, eventually placing himself between the surviving piggies and his own riot. He later collaborates with Olhado on faster-than-light travel.</li></ul>

<p>The <b>Pequeninos</b> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_language" title="Portuguese language">Portuguese</a> for "Little Ones"), also known as Lusitanian Aborigines or <b>piggies</b>, are an <a href="Extraterrestrial_life.html" title="Extraterrestrial life">alien</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species" title="Species">species</a> in the category ramen, or sentient non-human. They are forest-dwelling and technologically primitive, but incredibly intelligent species able to learn languages extremely quickly. They are given the nickname "piggy" by the colonists of the planet Lusitania where part of the series is set due to their pig-like appearance.
</p>
<ul><li><b><span id="Rooter">Rooter</span></b>: One of the first pequeninos introduced in the series, Rooter was the most inquisitive of the piggies and had a strong relationship with Libo before he was abruptly brought into his third life as a father-tree.</li>
<li><b>Mandachuva:</b> The first crisis in human-pequenino relations occurred with the death of the first xenologer, Pipo Figueira, at the hands of the pequeninos. When Pipo discovered that the Descolada <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virus" title="Virus">virus</a>, which had nearly destroyed the human population of Lusitania, was a part of the pequeninos' normal physiology, he went to share that information with the pequeninos. The pequenino Mandachuva brought that news back to the wives, along with the implication that the humans were not all-powerful and godlike, and that in some respects pequeninos were even more powerful than humans. It was a revelation to be rewarded, but when Pipo was asked to bring Mandachuva to the "third life", Pipo, not understanding the nature of pequenino transformation, thought he was being asked to kill Mandachuva. He refused, preferring to lose his own life in the process. On their side Mandachuva, and the pequeninos in general, thought that they were rewarding Pipo, bringing him on to his third life, not understanding that no such thing existed for humans.</li>
<li><b>Leaf-eater:</b> Seventeen years later after the incident of Pipo and Mandachuva, the new xenologer and Pipo's son, Libo Figueira, suffered a similar fate. The piggy Leaf-eater had convinced the wives to let many more little mothers conceive than normal, and then convinced Libo to help them out with the famine that they were sure to face. It was an enormous risk because if Libo refused to help that whole generation of pequeninos would have starved, but the humans did in fact step in and provide assistance. After the first amaranth harvest, Libo was, like Pipo before him, asked to bring Leaf-eater to the third life, and, like his father, refused, thinking that he was saving Leaf-eater's life. Leaf-eater killed Libo, thinking on his part that he was helping Libo achieve his third life even though humans did not have a third life.</li>
<li><b>Human</b>: One of the sons of Rooter. Human was offered a chance to be brought into the third life as a fathertree, but only if Ender performed the ritual. Like Pipo and Libo before him, Ender showed extreme distaste at the concept, but he managed to do so with a full understanding of the consequences of his actions. Soon after, Ender wrote a biography called "Life of Human" in memory of his friend. The name "Human" was given to him by the Pequeninos "because he was very smart".</li>
<li><b>Star-looker</b>: One of the wives. She represented the pequeninos in their treaty with the humans. She is also called "Shouter" by the brothers behind her back because of her loud voice.</li>
<li><b><span id="Warmaker">Warmaker</span></b>: A pequenino that died and entered the "third life" as a tree. He convinced a tribe of Pequeninos that the Descolada virus was a form of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Ghost" class="mw-redirect" title="Holy Ghost">Holy Ghost</a> of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ" class="mw-redirect" title="Christ">Christ</a> and that it should be spread to all humans on the Hundred Worlds. The tribe kidnapped and tortured Father Estevão, Ender's stepson, by exposing him to the virus for several days without medication. This event triggered a massacre of the pequeninos by the humans of Lusitania.</li>
<li><b>Planter</b>: A pequenino featured prominently in <i><a href="Xenocide.html" title="Xenocide">Xenocide</a></i>. When it was revealed to him that the descolada was manipulating pequenino behavior, he became almost suicidal, insisting that he be deprived of the descolada until death to prove that the pequenino's sentience was not caused by the descolada. Although he never entered the third life as a fathertree, he was awarded the honor of retaining his name after being planted, something which no other brothertree was given.</li>
<li><b>Glass</b>: Similar to Planter, Glass was the subject of a descolada deprivation test. However, Glass's experiment was the testing of Ela's new recolada virus. He successfully made the transition into the third life as fathertree.</li>
<li><b>Fire-quencher</b>: The pequenino representative who travels to the planet of the descoladores with Miro, Val, and the others in <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children_of_the_Mind" title="Children of the Mind">Children of the Mind</a></i>.</li>
<li><b>Arrow</b>: A pequenino mentioned in Speaker for the Dead. His name shows how humans affected pequenino culture.</li></ul>

<li><b><span id="Jiang-qing"></span><span id="Jiang-Qing"></span><span id="Han_Jiang-qing">Han Jiang-qing</span></b> was the wife of Han Fei-tzu.

She is named after the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Mother_of_the_West" title="Queen Mother of the West">Queen Mother of the West</a>, a powerful figure in Chinese mythology. When the godspoken genes are studied in hopes of retaining the genius-level intellect but removing the OCD, it is discovered that Wang-mu has naturally mutated into such a condition, and her genes are treated as a model of what the revision is intended to do, making her rather outrageous name somewhat less ironic. Later, she accompanies the reborn Peter Wiggin on his quest to stop the destruction of Lusitania, and eventually marries him.</li></ul>

<ul><li><b>Randall Firth</b>: Originally named Achilles Flanders II, Firth is the missing ninth child of Bean and Petra. Randall was born prematurely and appears to have Anton's Key turned. His mother, Nichelle Firth, also known as Randi believes Achilles is a hero assassinated by foul enemies. Nichelle allows Achilles to implant an embryo, believing that she would be carrying Achilles' child. To avoid persecution by Peter Wiggin, Randi determines to leave Earth and live in a colony, where she can raise her child and return him to Earth later to become the new Achilles. Nichelle ends up as a part of the colony Ganges led by Virlomi. Randall, called "Achilles" by Nichelle, is raised to see Peter the Hegemon and Julian Delphiki (otherwise known as Bean) as monsters, and to believe that Achilles was a true hero. Randall was one of the first to read "The Hive Queen" and treat it like a holy book, and thus he was also the first to paint Ender in a negative light, as Ender "The Xenocide". When Ender encounters Randall on Ganges, Randall plots to provoke Ender so that Ender will strike out and kill Randall. He thinks if this can be done, the universe will realize that Ender was a dangerous criminal. However, Ender does not strike out and instead tells Randall about his true mother and father: Petra Arkanian and Julian Delphiki. Randall is so enraged by this that he proceeds to brutally beat Ender, but Ender does not retaliate at all. Just before he delivers the final blow, Randall realizes that what Ender has told him is true, and he takes Ender to a doctor immediately. Randall then decides to rename himself Arkanian Delphiki, after his true parents.</li>

<ul><li><b>Anton</b> is a scientist of European descent who discovers two genetic modifications which will allow the human brain unlimited growth, at the cost of unlimited <i>physical</i> growth. This discovery, Anton's Key, is named in his honor. However, research into human genetic engineering was outlawed by the international community, and when the nature of his work was discovered, he was subjected to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_conditioning" title="Classical conditioning">classical conditioning</a> to make it difficult for him to continue or even discuss his research.</li>
<li><b><span id="Volescu">Volescu</span></b> is an unethical scientist of European descent, and the brother of Bean's father. He illegally modified 23 human embryos, "turning" Anton's Key within them; only one, Bean himself, was ever grown to maturity. Volescu was later discovered and had to destroy all his "research," but Bean escaped him by, at the age of 9 months, hiding himself in the tank of a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toilet" title="Toilet">toilet</a>. Volescu was later imprisoned for his crimes.</li>
<li><b><span id="Poke">Poke</span></b> is an orphan girl from the streets of Rotterdam, the leader of a "crew" of fellow orphans who eventually take in Bean&#8212;and Achilles. Poke gave Bean his name, which he was originally unfond of, but later recognizes himself as Bean and ignores Colonel Graff, who tells Bean his true identity as Julian Delphiki. In Rotterdam, Bean, on some instinct, tells Poke to kill Achilles when she has the chance; she refuses, and Achilles later kills her, after kissing her, by stabbing her in the eye and then throwing her in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhine_River" class="mw-redirect" title="Rhine River">Rhine</a>. Bean witnessed the kiss in the dark and, after leaving the scene, came to the realization that Poke was unsafe.  He rushes back to find Poke already dead; Bean then blames himself for Poke's death. When Bean tells the story of Poke to Ender's jeesh on the journey to Eros, he decides to trust Petra, saying to her, "You cried for Poke, and that makes us friends."</li>

Later, when he escapes from a mental institution in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgium" title="Belgium">Belgium</a> and begins his reign of terror, she and Bean go undercover to oppose him, eventually linking up with Peter Wiggin. She, like Poke, meets her death at Achilles' hands; Bean is never able to forgive himself for these deaths.</li>
<li><b>Ullysses</b> is a bully in Rotterdam. To help his family receive food from a soup kitchen, Achilles makes a point of beating up Ullysses. When he is released from a hospital he gloats about getting even with him. Ullysses is later killed by Achilles.</li>
<li><b>Andrew 'Ender' Delphiki</b> is Bean and Petra's son who travels in the relativistic spaceship with Bean and his two siblings. He is one of four children in which Anton's Key is turned. He is determined to find a cure for Anton's Key. When he and his siblings find a new world to settle in, he devises and administers a virus that will develop an organelle to shut off their growth genome, leaving their intelligence intact but saving them from the giantism half of Anton's Key.</li>
<li><b>Rymus Ojman</b> is the chairman of the cabinet of Starways Congress around the year 1970 S.C..</li>
<li><b>Jakt</b> is Valentine Wiggin's husband. He is originally from Trondheim, where he was one of the most respected lords of a fishing fleet on the planet. He chooses to depart from Trondheim with Valentine while in his sixties.</li>
