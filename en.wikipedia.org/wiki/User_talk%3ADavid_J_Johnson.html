<p>Apparently (although I have only just discovered this myself) in order to get the infobox to display a "dialling code" you have to use the parameter "dial_code".  Confused?  You should be.

<p>Please explain to me what "Using knowledge virtually unique to the CIA" means.  Is the knowledge of how to jump out of an airplane unique?  Knowledge that this was going to happen?

<dl><dd>Firstly, please sign any "contribution" and use the D. B. Cooper article Talk page. I agree the "CIA" line is unclear and requires source/reference. My own view is that the line should be deleted unless a reliable source is found.

</p><p>So, who is the dummy who page protected Roswell UFO incident to stop a proper scientific discussion on the case by SUNRISE Information Services? If you are able to accept Annie Jacobsen's Area 51 from so-called Area 51 scientists who have no verifiable facts to contribute to the discussion, then it may well interest you to know that SUNRISE has a book with verifiable facts from the scientific literature confirming the metallic foil composition and status of titanium technology and titanium-based shape memory alloys in 1947, not to mention the connection between the USAF at Wright-Patterson in the study of titanium-based shape-memory alloys after 1947 and the shape-memory Roswell foil that ended up at Wright-Patterson AFB for analysis in July 1947. If anyone here is a verifiable scientist, the first thing you do is verify the new entry by reading the book and checking the references. If you don't, accept the new item into the Roswell UFO incident page. It is there for the world to see and let others check the claims if you or anyone else on this page can't do the job properly.  <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signatures" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment added by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/101.169.170.169" title="Special:Contributions/101.169.170.169">101.169.170.169</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:101.169.170.169" title="User talk:101.169.170.169">talk</a>) 07:48, 1 August 2012 (UTC)</span>

<dl><dd>Just deleting useful material is not helpful. If you do not think it is in the right section, create a new section.

<p>Hi, thanks for the message. I certainly agree that Michel should be mentioned, though I think the new editor maybe has a point about the beer!

<p>Hello, and thanks for the message - you are right that the Breakwater lighthouse could be worth noting, although there doesn't seem to be as much information on it than the other three. I believe there may be a good amount of information for all lighthouses to warrant separate articles and having recently found a couple of Stuart Morris books based on Portland, there may be some good information in there too. I think that another article for the Portland Bill lighthouse should be separate from the Portland Bill article - like Pulpit Rock, for example, is. There would certainly be plenty of information on that lighthouse. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Ajsmith141" title="User:Ajsmith141">Ajsmith141</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Ajsmith141" title="User talk:Ajsmith141">talk</a>) 11:55, 17 November 2012 (UTC)

<li>No problem at all. My mistake on the captions - the two photos are the only ones on the geograph.org.uk site but next time I visit Portland I will take some photographs of the windmills. I only first saw the windmills back in 2010 during a visit, and despite growing up in Fortuneswell as a child I didn't realise they existed. Me and a friend had a look inside both the shafts last month and they seem perfectly stable which is one thing but they do need cleaning up and looked after. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Ajsmith141" title="User:Ajsmith141">Ajsmith141</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Ajsmith141" title="User talk:Ajsmith141">talk</a>) 17:22, 23 January 2013 (UTC)</li>

<p>Greetings. If the section about AAdvantage was more than just one line, I feel the logo could be there. Or if there was a major discussion about the new branding in the article (not just a line), then I can see the logo being there. However, we need to keep fair use/copyrighted work usage to a minimum and if people want to see the logo, they can go to the articles about the program itself. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Zscout370" title="User:Zscout370">User:Zscout370</a> <small><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Zscout370" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Return Fire)</a></sup></small> 17:27, 23 January 2013 (UTC)
</p>
<ul><li>Hi, Thanks for yours. I still feel that the logo should be there, as this is the main page for American Airlines and should emcompass all logos - regardless of separate articles on some aspect of the airline.  The previous AAdvantage logo was there without comment and I really see no reason to change that. Folk are not going to the AAdvantage page just to see a logo? However, I do not want to stand on ceremony and I'm prepared to accept a majority view.

<ul><li>I know there were other editors discussing about it and I just wanted to share my view point. All it is just about is commentary; if there is more commentary about the logo itself or re-branding, then yes the logo can still be there. The only thing I can think of is maybe merge the two articles together and then we can use the logo. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Zscout370" title="User:Zscout370">User:Zscout370</a> <small><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Zscout370" title="User talk:Zscout370">(Return Fire)</a></sup></small> 17:51, 23 January 2013 (UTC)

<dl><dd>I don't know what that means.  Most people categorized as pantheists, never say "I am a pantheist".  It's a rare philosophical description and it's not anything one subscribes to.  Sagan agreed with Spinoza and Einstein on God, which makes him a pantheist.  This is the opinion of many PhDs in philosophy and theology. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Allisgod&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Allisgod (page does not exist)">Allisgod</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Allisgod" class="mw-redirect" title="User talk:Allisgod">talk</a>) 19:48, 26 January 2013 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>Hi, Thank you for your note, as you can check the "view history" of the pages, you see that Slurpy121 (which is me, only that I forgot to log in) undid the change, basically, I fixed my own error and I am sorry for any trouble or inconvenience I have caused. I thought at first France played a big role during the war, but after doing some reading and research, I proved myself wrong. Anyways, I wish for the best and Good luck&#160;:) (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/69.255.225.227" title="Special:Contributions/69.255.225.227">69.255.225.227</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:69.255.225.227" title="User talk:69.255.225.227">talk</a>) 00:00, 15 February 2013 (UTC))

<p>My purpose in editing the plot section of Rio Bravo is to clarify some sections of the plot writeup and to correct some obvious errors.
</p><p>One example is in the first paragraph where Dean Martin's character was referred to as the deputy sheriff which he clearly was not because Jon Wayne's character swears him in as deputy a short while later.  Therefore I added the word former to clarify the character.  Similarly, I added a sentence to place Angie Dickinson's character in the poker game instead of just getting off the stage.  This change makes John Wayne's actions understandable.  The remainder of the changes follow the same idea – clarify the existing plot writeup without a complete rewrite which I don't believe is really necessary and add a few words and sentences here and there to make the plot more understandable without making it larger.  The largest change I have made is to the ending scene between Jon Wayne's character and Angie Dickinson's character.  Not only is it important to the movie but it can easily cause confusion because it differs slightly from the written script (at least as it was published on the Internet).  The scene between Stumpy and Dude is often edited or omitted in movie versions shown on television so I have clarified that.
</p><p>As far as the occasional typo and spacing, I am using NaturallySpeaking software to dictate the changes and there are occasional problems where the software doesn't quite put in what I want and I sometimes have to change it again later.  Have patience, I am going to work on this movie until I think it is perfect because it is one of my favorites and I want what is in the plot to exactly describe what happens in the movie without being too wordy.
</p><p>I am having a little issue with the fact that the editor shows the spacing between sentences differently from the way they show in the text.  Perhaps you have a word of advice on how to deal with this apparent problem.  Perhaps I am missing something obvious.
</p><p>I have the DVD of the movie and will be adding it to the references section when I get a chance to read up on the proper way to add references.

<ul><li><ul><li>I cannot help with your technical points, I'm afraid - but I am concerned by the number of typos that appear in your edits. My own view is that the plot section is too long - but that can be discussed on the Talk Page.

<p>Hi, Several people have been reverting the description of Biblical Cosmology to one that is just completely fraudulent and doesn't have hardly a thing to do with the Bible's actual description of the cosmos. It's nearly a carbon copy of the Babylonian one and not accurate at all. It's about as accurate as calling America a communist nation. Isn't wikipedia supposed to be accurate? All who have reverted it simply do not seem to care about accuracy. They may have good intentions, but their description is not accurate at all. I have MUCH more documentation of this I can add if you wish, even by agnostic scientists. I'm also a professor myself and have done quite a bit of study into the Bible as well as science and history. Wikipedia is very good in many places..but there is unfortunately a bias against historical facts in some areas, sometimes in Christian areas, but not limited to that by any means. I use wikipedia a lot...but we need to make sure it is accurate, not just supporting a prejudiced agenda.
Sorry I haven't contacted others about this..I just figured out how to use the talk pages just now.

<ul><li>With respect this is something that should be discuseed on the appropiate Talk Page.  You and others(?) are reverting edits without giving a reason for your reverts. Additionally, 3 reverts without a reason can be considered as "Edit Warring" and can result in  block. In any case there will be many who will not consider your source as "historical fact".

<ul><li>With respect, there are explicit reasons for the editing as mentioned above, but if you want, I can add that to the actual editing. I didn't realize that was necessary.  Describing the Bible's cosmology as Babylonian is seriously fraudulent. THAT is the reason for the edit.
<ul><li>I'm sorry but what I have written is historical fact (the only valid source for describing biblical cosmology is the Bible itself.

<p>Hi! I added a single sentence on the page of USS Scorpion, where I mentioned that it was fictionally mentioned in Neville Shute's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Beach_(novel)" title="On the Beach (novel)"><i>On the Beach</i></a>, which is one of the most well-known literary works about nuclear war.

If so, why don't you also go to the page of for instance <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Orient_Express" title="The Orient Express">The Orient Express</a> page and remove all the fictional references, such as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agatha_Christie" title="Agatha Christie">Agatha Christie</a> novel? Wikipedia does include the mentioning of prominent fictional references to real boats, trains or buildings etc. I am going to undo your revert within a few days, unless you come up with some reasonable arguments. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Sponsianus" title="User:Sponsianus">Sponsianus</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Sponsianus" title="User talk:Sponsianus">talk</a>) 19:57, 12 March 2013 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>Hello and thank you for a long-delayed response. I have answered on your Talk Page. The main point being that the fictional novel was published in 1957, the USS Scorpion was not even laid-down until 1958. Also Orient Express is a real train, the Christie novel being set on it - the Shute novel cannot be set on a vessel that did not exist at the time of publishing. Regards, <a href="User%253ADavid_J_Johnson.html" title="User:David J Johnson">David J Johnson</a> (<a href="User_talk%253ADavid_J_Johnson.html#top" title="User talk:David J Johnson">talk</a>) 20:33, 12 March 2013 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Thanks for your reply. Neville Shute's novel was first published within months (April 1957) after the production of the real USS Scorpion had commenced (January 1957), which would have been well known at the time. Apparently Shute referred to the fictional fate of the "real" USS Scorpion, and the fact that the ship was so modern it was not completed yet would hardly have been an obstacle for an author of a dystopian novel - rather, the other way around! Fictional references to real vessels are just that - fictional. On the page of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Celeste" title="Mary Celeste">Mary Celeste</a> you will find many unrealistic references to that ship, including spaceships named after it. So yes, I think it's relevant that a well-known author of the era found it worthy to use the name of the USS Scorpion. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Sponsianus" title="User:Sponsianus">Sponsianus</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Sponsianus" title="User talk:Sponsianus">talk</a>) 22:10, 12 March 2013 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Thank you for yours. Frankly, you seem to be assuming too much. What evidence do you have that Shute knew that USS Scorpion was under construction? And, in any case, this vessel was re-named and the actual name Scorpion was not laid-down until 1958 and launched much later.  Please explain how this was well-known at the time. I find it very hard to believe that Shute wrote a novel about a sub that was hardly under construction when his novel was published.  The examples you give of Orient Express and Mary Celeste refer to trains/ships that were already in service and are therefore not strictly relevent to your PoV.  I see nothing in your much delayed comments that warrants a reversion to your contribution of June 2012 and it appears nor do any other Editors.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dl><dd><dl><dd>Hi, David -- Don't know if you've noticed, but our Bundy loser seems to have opened a whole series of obscene socks, the latest being "ChristRaper666" (I kid you not).

<p>Hi, sorry you thought I did something wrong, I just think that regardless of people's view on it, execution by the state is not homicide.

<dl><dd>Quite simply, because you have placed your name far too high on the cast list. You have already been warned before about this self-advertising and writing articles about yourself.

<p>I placed my name under the character I was paired with in the film, Chris Klein.  Our characters' storyline was built on the relationship.

<p>I believe that if all insertions about anyone are correct then his/her article should remain.  Fact is fact and should not be erased from the pages of history.  Who are we to choose a hierarchy of importance referring to individuals within entertainment (or any field for that matter)?  Either everyone stays (as long as their pages speak only fact), or everyone within their respective industry gets deleted.  No favorites.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:EdVanzd&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:EdVanzd (page does not exist)">EdVanzd</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:EdVanzd" title="User talk:EdVanzd">talk</a>) 16:52, 11 May 2013 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Quite simply, you have been told by several editors that it is against Wikipedia policy to write, self advertising, biographies.

<p>You told me that using CAPS was SHOUTING - and you implied offense. 
</p><p>I apologize. I am new to WIKIPEDIA and had not known this. For several years now (since Email became common) I have used CAPS when BOLD or Italic was not available. 
The intent was not to make my argument necessarily stronger (or louder), but to allow the reader to rapidly scan through the text zeroing in on key words (in CAPS).
</p><p>Guidance appreciated.

<p>Thank you for your interest and concern regarding user BSmith821's POV and advertisements. User BSmith821 statement of purpose in his user page is clear that he is a single-purpose user that does not hold Wikipedia's integrity and neutrality as his intention to edit. He managed to dock the ANI by stepping down but now he is back at it, and his campaign to promote Chandra Wickramasinghe's fringe work is distracting from constructive editing.  I will appreciate suggestions on how to proceed in order to stop his advertisement campaign in Wikipedia.

<dl><dd>Hello BatteryIncluded. my concern for the "neutral point of view" is increasing. Please see BSmith821's long-winded reply to my concerns on the article Talk page. You have done sterling work in bring sense to the article and this "editors" contributions - sorry advertising and PoV - are in danger of reverting the article back to its previous mish-mash.  My advice would be to get an experienced administrator to have a look at the recent history of the article and, in particular, BSmith821's edits the statement on his Talk page - and then take the appropiate action. Please let me know if I can help in any way.

<dl><dd>I do not believe that identifying the name of the political entity in which it lies is "going off at a tangent". We have already identified that it is located in the State of Pennsylvania, and in Somerset County. Somerset County is divided into townships and boroughs. It had to land in one (or more, if on a town line) of them. The given coordinates, assuming that they are accurate, happen to place the site in Stonycreek Township, is all that I am trying to say. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Backspace&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Backspace (page does not exist)">Backspace</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Backspace" title="User talk:Backspace">talk</a>) 17:33, 6 August 2013 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>I may be wrong, but I think I have seen you make multiple edits or reverts on pages having to do with 9/11, which would lead me to believe it is something you are very knowledgeable about and/or interested in. Why no mention of this on your user page, especially since you are in the serial killer thing? I've never been to the UK before, is 9/11 a popular (I don't want to say popular because it is actually a tragedy) topic of conversation over there? There is a guy on YouTube, Myles Powers, who made a wonderful series debunking many of the nonsense claims about 9/11, and he is from the UK as well. I was never aware anyone else in the world thought about it as much as any American would.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Zdawg1029" title="User:Zdawg1029">Zdawg1029</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Zdawg1029" title="User talk:Zdawg1029">talk</a>) 00:29, 11 October 2013 (UTC)

<p>David, I think you are one of the -- probably self-appointed -- suppressors of dissent for 9/11 articles found on Wikipedia.  You removed my posting in the article, "September 11 Attacks," which said "the certainty of these attacks and their link to all the damage is widely disputed" (citation consensus911.org).  That statement quite true, within common limits of generality.  You commented that there are separate "conspiracy theory"  pages.  So there are! -- and the "conspiracy"(unnecessary adjective) theory article I affiliate with, "World Trade Center Controlled Demolition Conspiracy Theory," has abundant references to the "main-stream-news" theory.  So would you remove such references, also?  (I may be working on improving that article.)  I think both theories should be cross-referenced, and your removal of my statement defeats the airing of good evidence and research. If you need to be convinced that dissenters about the "September 11 Attacks" are not purely some marginal group, please see the video, "9/11 Controlled Demolition: Experts Speak Out," available at AE911Truth.org and Amazon.com, and books such as _The Mysterious Collapse of World Trade Center Building 7: Why the Final Official Report about 911 is Unscientific and False_ by David Ray Griffin -- which has an interesting list of named endorsers.  (See Amazon.com.)  Web sites such as AE911Truth.org have lists of named endorsers in the thousands.  It would be very big of you to restore the edit you removed.  Cross-referencing should not be suppressed.  <small><span class="autosigned">—&#160;Preceding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signatures" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment added by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Stickler4accuracy2&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Stickler4accuracy2 (page does not exist)">Stickler4accuracy2</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Stickler4accuracy2" title="User talk:Stickler4accuracy2">talk</a> • <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Stickler4accuracy2" title="Special:Contributions/Stickler4accuracy2">contribs</a>) 01:10, 31 October 2014 (UTC)</span></small>

<dl><dd><dl><dd>Firstly, please sign any contributions you may make. Secondly, no-one is "self appointed", any editor is welcome to contribute to Wikipedia - so long as their contributions are from reliable and respected sources. The "conspiracy theories" which you appear to be trying to further, have been widely discounted as fringe and have been constantly deleted by many editors from the main articles about 9/11.

Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise.

<p>David, I fear that you are in error when you say that "This is a fictional story, no citations needed" - it is a <i>factual</i> article about a fictional work, and therefore does indeed require citations where appropriate - check any of the other articles about works of fiction for examples. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:QuipQuotch" title="User:QuipQuotch">QuipQuotch</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:QuipQuotch" title="User talk:QuipQuotch">talk</a>) 23:28, 22 November 2013 (UTC)

<dl><dd><dl><dd>David, Wikipedia makes no distinction between articles about works of fiction and other articles when it comes to the need for citations, so I am afraid that your view is somewhat unusual. In any event, the article in question is about more than Arthur Machen's short story - it is about the legend inspired but it, and the various claims made by real people concerning the legend. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:QuipQuotch" title="User:QuipQuotch">QuipQuotch</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:QuipQuotch" title="User talk:QuipQuotch">talk</a>) 22:16, 24 November 2013 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>Hello David. Since you seem to be in involved in SETI, let me ask you: I was wondering if you could point me a link about the Wow signal that describes its properties. Was there a modulation of any kind suggesting data? Were quasars ruled out? Thank you for keeping this article neutral and clean. Cheers, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:BatteryIncluded" class="mw-redirect" title="User:BatteryIncluded">BatteryIncluded</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:BatteryIncluded" class="mw-redirect" title="User talk:BatteryIncluded">talk</a>) 21:39, 2 June 2014 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>Hello BI and good to hear from you. Regarding the properties of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wow!_signal" title="Wow! signal">Wow! signal</a>, the best references are by Jerry Ehman, who discovered the signal, and are detailed in references 2 and 10 in the article references. Also Robert H Gray's book "The Elusive WOW", published Palmer Square Press, Chicago; goes into detail of the signal and subsequent searches. Hopefully, the book should still be available from Amazon. To answer your question: quasars were ruled out - the signal was only received once and then for only 70 odd seconds. Unfortunately Jerry did not look at the printout until several days after the signal was received, which precluded a immediate follow-up.  With best regards, David, <a href="User%253ADavid_J_Johnson.html" title="User:David J Johnson">David J Johnson</a> (<a href="User_talk%253ADavid_J_Johnson.html#top" title="User talk:David J Johnson">talk</a>) 22:03, 2 June 2014 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>This portion answers my question: "The signal could have been varying (modulated) at a frequency faster than once every 5 seconds (or 0.2 Hz, corresponding to one half the data collection period) and we wouldn't have seen that modulation since our observatory was not equipped to detect such modulation. Also, any modulation occurring at a frequency slower than once every 144 seconds (about 0.00694 Hz, corresponding to twice the duration of the 72-second Wow! signal) would not have been seen"</dd>
<dd>So basically, they were scanning the sky, not actually listening. I still find it strange that they did a second scan of the same portion of the sky <b>years</b> later, and not 3 days after they found it. I read recently that very distant galaxies can bend light (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_lens" title="Gravitational lens">Gravitational lens</a>), so I think the RF signal could have come from nearby, not from that exact point in the sky.

<dl><dd>Well, I've made a slight adjustment anyway. I can adjust the coordinates a bit further, if you want get back to me on that. I should mention that it's very easy to get to an OS map: if you just click on the coordinates taking you to GeoHack, and then scroll down to "Geograph Britain and Ireland" and click on "Photos", that takes you to the Geograph website.

<p>Hi David,
</p><p>I don't suppose you have a copy of the book "The Coastal Defences of Portland and Weymouth," by Andrews, E.A., and M.L. Pinsent? This rather elusive book is referenced in a number of places but I can't seem to find any actual copy of it, and was curious to see whether Portland's East Weares Rifle Range was perhaps mentioned, even though it is not a defence as such. There seems to be very little information on the range, which is surprising for such an iconic landmark on that side of the island. I have attempted to submit the range to English Heritage for consideration of becoming a listed monument, but no response as of yet.
</p><p>I hope you've enjoyed any of the Portland pages you may have come across. At this rate I'll have little left to write about! It got to a point where I thought a template for the island was necessary to collaborate everything for ease of accessing the many different pages.
</p><p>Kind regards, Ashley <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Ajsmith141" title="User:Ajsmith141">Ajsmith141</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Ajsmith141" title="User talk:Ajsmith141">talk</a>) 21:21, 26 June 2014 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Hello Ashley and good to hear from you. I'm afraid I cannot help with the book, I have checked on Amazon and come-up with a blank. The only thing I can suggest is to check with a Portland or Weymouth local library?  Thank you for all your contributions for Portland.  May I just remind you that a recent pic is needed for North Mill on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland_Windmills" title="Portland Windmills">Portland Windmills</a> page, most of the ivy having been removed - or blown-off.

<dl><dd>Hi David, no worries, it certainly seems difficult to find. Good idea about the library, they might have it. I've got some recent pics of both windmills, and will update the article as some point. Seems another surrounding field is about to be quarried too, so soon the windmills will be surrounded with them! <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Ajsmith141" title="User:Ajsmith141">Ajsmith141</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Ajsmith141" title="User talk:Ajsmith141">talk</a>) 09:22, 27 June 2014 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<p>I left this reply on my talk page: Sorry to say that I have not followed through yet. I decided to research the matter. While I found references to the prior findings and a few sentences that point to them, I found nothing more on them. That gave me a little pause and I let it slip into the background. Still, I need to gather such information as I have and present it to someone for a further look. Rather than go immediately to an administrator, I think I will pose the question to a few editors who work regularly on American Civil War articles to see if we can get something of a consensus.

<dl><dd>Further reply on my talk page: I agree. I wanted to present the best case and slipped up when I found this would require more digging around than I thought. Regardless of that, it is original research and most of it is quite dubious. I don't think there is any bad faith which is another reason why I hesitated while searching for a definitive source. Still, it is outside the Wikipedia policy in any event. The early warnings may or may not have convinced the user of that. Also, I think most or all of the conclusions are speculative at best. No real correlation between common names in unit rosters and the "survivors" can be made and such additional sources as are mentioned don't seem to make the connection as well. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Donner60" title="User:Donner60">Donner60</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Donner60" title="User talk:Donner60">talk</a>) 22:15, 27 August 2014 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dl><dd>I have written almost two pages of explanation of the no original research policy, mainly with direct quotes from the Wikipedia page on that topic and on verifiability. I have begun to write examples of the problems with the research. I think that an explanation of this sort will be needed to support reversion of the revisions to the article and to explain to others why there is a problem. I also have done some more research but the two key articles are not online. Some support for the debunking of the claimants after Crump is already noted on the page and can be included. Far too late to finish it tonight but I have made good progress. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Donner60" title="User:Donner60">Donner60</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Donner60" title="User talk:Donner60">talk</a>) 08:51, 28 August 2014 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>I have done a little vandalism reversion this week and have changed my essay concerning the last surviving Confederate veterans after coming close to finishing it. My energy level has been low as I recover from the sinus infection and cope with the effects of antibiotics, which I find tiring. As I noted before, I started writing an essay on original research and some of the problems with the article for the article talk page. I now have decided that the most conservative approach would be appreciated by neutral parties and administrators, and maybe even the editor.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>I have a new essay in progress to place on the user's talk page as a first step. I have rewritten and somewhat shortened the original research explanation from the first draft essay. I also have started explaining the problems with the user's work on each of the 11 persons other than Crump. Policy guidelines on assertions that a user's work is original work through synthesis seem to require extra care. Because I can see some use for some of the facts the user asserts, I think a small part of his work, such as some reference to Professor Hoar's work, might be saved, at least if rewritten. I plan to ask him to modify the work, offer to do it myself (which I would rather not do) or if he agrees to neither, inform him that I will take it to the talk page first and then to a noticeboard or administrator if finally required. I would finish my first draft essay for the talk page but it would be similar to the talk page draft. I call these essays because they will be several typewritten pages. That is too long for most purposes but I think we have a special case here. I think the user genuinely thinks his work is valid and that he has uncovered something no one else has found. I also surmise the user may be a young person, who I do not wish to discourage. Yet, Wikipedia can not make exceptions and allow original research and speculation by the Wikipedia writer on that basis. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Donner60" title="User:Donner60">Donner60</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Donner60" title="User talk:Donner60">talk</a>) 03:13, 6 September 2014 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

</p><p>I was about to post the following essay on the user's talk page when I thought I should solicit your opinion. Is this the right approach? Is it stated well, correctly and respectfully? You can see why it took me so long to complete this and why I have conflicting feelings about this. Not all of the previously given statuses of the claimants were shown as debunked as concluded by William Marvel and apparently a few other writers. This leaves the possibility that some additions to the article, if not original research, might be made. It also raises questions about the sources used to support the previous conclusions. Complete support is not given in the previous article. Rather than go on at length only to add a lengthy draft raising many of the same points, I will leave it at that. Please give me your views and do not feel rushed. I know this is quite much to look over. The draft:
</p><p>You have done interesting and diligent research and writing on the article <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_surviving_Confederate_veterans" title="Last surviving Confederate veterans">Last surviving Confederate veterans</a>. I do not doubt your good faith or neutral point of view. I wish I could leave it at that but I think your additions need modification to fit within Wikipedia guidelines on original research and synthesis and to avoid speculation. At the risk of being tedious, but because I also respect your effort and think some of it can be saved or rewritten, I explain my position and my suggestions in detail. I do not wish to discourage you in any way. Any criticism I express is meant to be constructive and not negative. I simply think it is necessary to conform changes to the article with Wikipedia guidelines and to avoid unsourced conjecture.
</p><p>If you agree with my assessment, I assume you will prefer to make revisions to the article, rather than have me keep only a little of your work and revert the rest. Also, you are familiar with the topic and appear to have the main sources available to you. I provide below detailed comments on the text of the article for your consideration. First, I think I need to explain why I think much of the revised article is not in line with Wikipedia's policy against publishing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research" title="Wikipedia:No original research">original research</a>. Another editor and I noted this to you a few months ago. Your changes since then appear to have been an effort to provide more sources and better analysis rather than to limit your additions to material contained in sources considered reliable and verifiable under Wikipedia guidelines, rather than to provide your own new analysis. 
</p><p>Your work has much original content or analysis, and unfortunately to some extent is based on conjecture. This type of speculative analysis, by you rather than the author of a reliable source, does not entirely conform to Wikipedia's policy of publishing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">verifiable information</a> from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources">reliable sources</a>. Also see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability,_not_truth" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability, not truth">Wikipedia:Verifiability, not truth</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Third-party_sources" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:Third-party sources">Wikipedia:Third-party sources</a>.
</p><p>You have cited some primary sources which some include in the policy against original research. I do not see a problem with these sources when used carefully to report what the records say. The problem arises when facts from the sources are used to support an analysis not made by the source or by authors of later reliable sources. You have cited some reliable sources as well but you draw many conclusions that appear not to be expressed or supported by the authors. This might be fine if you were publishing a new article with new conclusions but that is not the type of article that Wikipedia includes.
</p><p>I think it is good that you place little, if any, reliance on Find-a-grave and Ancestry.com. These may not be reliable, third-party sources because they are self-published, do not have editorial control for the most part and only have reliable sources if the writers find and include them, which they often do not. You refer to documents which may be available at the Ancestry web site, but since they require a subscription to see them, and since you analyze rather than just report them, it does not appear they can provide support to change conclusions in the article. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Identifying_reliable_sources" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:Identifying reliable sources">Wikipedia:Identifying reliable sources</a>. If the documents directly support your content rather than providing a stepping stone, more about them needs to be added.
</p><p>Before commenting on the details for the article and for each claimed veteran, I think it is best to add some more information about original research. Although you can find the information about original research on the cited Wikipedia guideline pages, I believe it may be helpful for me to quote some key points so they are included here for reference. 
</p><p>On the page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:No_original_research" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a>, the following explanation of original research is given: "The phrase "original research" (OR) is used on Wikipedia to refer to material—such as facts, allegations, and ideas—for which no reliable, published sources exist. <b>This includes any analysis or synthesis of published material that serves to reach or imply a conclusion not stated by the sources.</b> To demonstrate that you are not adding OR, you must be able to cite reliable, published sources that are directly related to the topic of the article, and directly support the material being presented." In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:What_SYNTH_is_not" title="Wikipedia:What SYNTH is not">Wikipedia:What SYNTH is not</a>, synthesis is further explained as "SYNTH cautions against original research by synthesis, where an editor combines reliably sourced statements in a way that makes or suggests a <b>new statement not supported by any one of the sources.</b>" Furthermore, the page says: "SYNTH provides a guideline for helping to determine the difference between summarizing the information from sources and <b>extrapolating new information</b> from sources." As I tried to explain above, I think that is a good description of much of your content.
</p><p>Another explanation of a problem with synthesis from the no original research page is: "If no reliable source has combined the material in this way, it is original research." The combining of sources in a way not found in reliable sources is a key problem in with many of the additions and changes to the article. As the guideline page points out: "...that precise analysis must have been published by a reliable source in relation to the topic before it can be published on Wikipedia."
</p><p>I could extend this somewhat but I think the above quotes are more than enough to explain the point. So I will turn to look at the additions to the article itself with respect to each of the supposed last surviving veterans.
</p><p>In my opinion, the article was deficient before your changes and needed to be improved if it could be. Despite my conclusion that much of your content is original research or conjecture, I think that some of your research and writing can be retained. I think some of it actually explains or supports the previous conclusions, although it appears you did not see it that way. Some material might be retained to support some minor changes to the conclusions or, more likely, to provide an explanation that some of the conclusions may be subject to some doubt. Changes of the status of the veteran claimants to very positive conclusions, including verified, do not appear to be supportable. I do not see them as supported by anything you have cited as you have explained the sources.
</p><p>I find the article before your revisions to be unsatisfactory because it is not entirely clear where each of the conclusions originates. The overall conclusion that Pleasant Crump is the last verified surviving Confederate veteran appears to remain required from the few reliable, verifiable sources that exist on the matter. The focus then becomes whether any of the other claims have any possible validity. This analysis must be done against the background that one of the few reliable sources on the matter, Marvel, reaches a blanket conclusion that all of the claims of persons who died after Pleasant Crump have been debunked. So it appears that any status that does not debunk or at least exclude the other claimants did not come from Marvel unless he was more specific in the article than in his later writing.

When Crump died on the closing day of 1951, he was the last of all those many thousands who had served in Lee's army: though no one noticed at the time, he was the last Confederate veteran in the world." On pages 263-264 of his previous book, Marvel, William.

</p><p>Marvel cites his own 1991 magazine article and Professor Hoar's work in support of his conclusions. Yet, he appears to leave the the door open for the addition of some further information as to at least one of the claimants. In his footnote to his previously quoted statement he writes on page 280: "After Crump's death a dozen other men claimed to have been Confederate soldiers (see Hoar, The South's Last Boys in Gray, 463–516), but military, pension, and especially census records <b>prove them all to have been fakes</b> (Marvel, “The Great Impostors,” 32–33). Hoar (60) lists two other alleged Appomattox survivors who were alive in April of 1950, but neither is named on the parole lists and at least one of them—if not both—also appears to have fabricated his Confederate service altogether."
</p><p>Is Marvel backing off from his conclusion as to one of the claimants? If so, who? What does he say about him in the magazine article, if anything? What does Hoar say about this claimant? Does he support the identity of the man and his Confederate service or does he simply provide some facts or possible arguments and leave the question open? In fact are neither of the men who Hoar mentions as alive in April 1950 on the list of those who survived past the date of Crump's death?
</p><p>Although this seems to leave room for analysis of only one other claimant, where did the conclusions such as Unknown or No Evidence or even Possible for more than one of the claimants in the previous version of the article originate and on what basis were they shown as other than debunked? Note that only one of these seems to be a possible older surviving veteran than Crump and maybe this justifies Marvel lumping them altogether. Again, Hoar's work, which I do not have, might answer these questions if Marvel himself does not explain these details in his magazine article. Unfortunately, I do not have Hoar's book or Marvel's “The Great Impostors.” Blue and Gray Magazine 8, no. 3 (February 1991) and I can find only a small quote from the article on line. I assume you can confirm or find some information from these publications that might answer the questions and in turn add useful information to the article, without drawing a conclusion not stated in the sources. 
</p><p>A blog is usually not considered a reliable reference but <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://kevinrandle.blogspot.com/2007/09/fakers.html">A Different Perspective. A Commentary on UFOs, Paranormal events, and related topics. FAKERS!</a>, Saturday, September 08, 2007, Retrieved August 31, 2014, has direct quotes from Marvel's magazine article. With regard to Walter Williams, the blog's author, Kevin Randle, states that: "Marvel found Williams on a census record from Hawamba (sic) County in 1860 on which he was listed as a five year old boy. That meant he was born, not in 1842 or 1847, but in 1855. Marvel found that in every census he gave a birth date that was consistent with being born in either late 1854 or early 1855. The census of 1910, which carried a column to designate those who had served in the Civil War, contained no such designation for Williams. He would have been, at best, eleven when the war ended."
</p><p>Randle also writes: "In fact, in the Blue &amp; Gray article, Marvel wrote, 'Every one of the last dozen recognized Confederates was bogus. Thomas Riddle was only five when the Confederacy collapsed, and Arnold Murray only nine. William Loudermilk, who insisted he fought through the Atlanta Campaign at 16, did not turn 14 until after Appomattox. William Bush and a reputed Confederate nurse named Sarah Rockwell were not 20 years old in the summer of 1865, but 15.' Marvel pointed out that most of these imposters were in it for the money and that it was 'a common scam.' They tacked a few extra years on their ages, claimed service in some 'obscure militia unit' and then could claim a state pension."
</p><p>In the absence of contrary definitive information from a reliable source, this disposes of these claimants. Did Marvel specifically mention the other five on the list, not including Crump and those just identified above? Even if he did not, he included them in his later blanket statements. Contrary information and conclusions need clear citation to a reliable, verifiable, neutral source in order to discuss the possibility of a different conclusion as to a claim.
</p><p>Did Hoar actually conclude that any of the claimants were verified? It seems that he did not except perhaps for Kinney, which is important and I mention below. He may have given some evidence in their favor which would leave the possibility of a conclusion other than debunked for one or more of them. If so, the most that could be done, however, is to note that he offers the evidence that might keep the possibility alive, but does not give a favorable conclusion for their claim. You actually seem to have done just this with one or more footnotes but in a broader, more conjectural way than I just expressed. That appears to me to mean that you used Hoar as a source for coming up with a different conclusion than Marvel's. If Hoar does not make such conclusions, however, the description in the article of what he has written about one or more of the claimants, especially Kinney, must be modified.
</p><p>Few other historians, or even journalists or other writers, seem to have addressed this issue of identifying the last surviving Confederate veteran so the works of Hoar, Marvel and perhaps Serrano if he differs from Marvel, and Lowry with respect to Riddle, are most, if not all, of the reliable sources. I have found little if anything more written about this topic that I can see has any assurance of being reliable and verifiable and that gives specific information on any of the claims.

Beard, Belle Boone. <i>Centenarians, the New Generation</i>. New York: Greenwood Press. 1991, contemporaneous with Marvel's magazine article, mentions several of the Confederate veterans as centenarians but gives no real proof or analysis of their claims. Marvel's article also was published in 1991 and his summary statements concerning claims of anyone who survived after Crump came in later works. The Beard book provides no basis for alternate conclusions.
</p><p><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://genealogytrails.com/main/lastveterans.html">'Genealogy Trails: The Last Veterans'</a>, Retrieved September 2, 2014 references Wikipedia, Marvel, a few obituaries of questionable complete accuracy and the Department of Veterans Affairs with respect to Salling's claim. The only conclusion in the list of 12 claimants to be the last Confederate veteran on that web site is that Walter Williams's claim has been debunked. The site accepts William J. Bush's approximate age but does not verify his service. It accepts Marvel's evidence against Salling but notes that the Department of Veterans Affairs accepts him as the last Confederate veteran. Congress's acceptance of his claim before he died may have much to do with leaving this stand. The conclusion is not in line with Marvel's or apparently to Hoar's later scrutiny. If the Department continues to accept his possible claim, this could be put in the footnote with a disclaimer concerning Marvel's and Hoar's non-acceptance of its accuracy. The web page has a question mark after every claimant's birth date except Crump's.
</p><p>While the foregoing points establish the general background and conclusions, I need to discuss the information you provided for each individual to see whether it is from reliable or verifiable sources and is not original research, synthesis or speculation. We need to see what can remain and what must be removed. Some of the material may be useful to support the conclusions previously given in the article, or the conclusions of the writers such as Marvel. 
</p><p>I start my comments on each person with the change made by you to the conclusion about the status of their claims. You changed the status for all but one of the claimants, which you kept the same. A question that must be asked about each claimant is: What do Marvel, Hoar or other writers say about the claim? I will not repeat this except when necessary to discuss the content of the article but it applies to all. You also will recognize that most of the facts I mention below are from your additions to the article.
</p><p>Felix Witkowski. Debunked changed to Dubious. Only speculation supports the change in status. The Alabama soldier found on the rolls does not have an identical name (different initial) and served in a different unit than the one the claimant says he served in. Persons with the same last name who served in South Carolina and Louisiana regiments have no bearing on this. Presumably a veteran would know the state from which his regiment was recruited.
</p><p>Thomas Edwin Ross. Unknown to Possible. There is no definitive proof that one of the people of this name who was either born at a date which made him old enough to serve in the Confederate army and that he actually did serve, was one and the same person. There are too many people with this name to verify that the Thomas Ross who lived until March 1952 was a Confederate veteran. His birth in 1850 reduces the chances as well. You correctly write: "As others named Thomas Ross were also Kentucky Confederate cavalrymen, these details are not enough to verify him..." Listing him as possible rather than leaving the status as unknown or no evidence is at best a stretch. Some brief mention of the various people with this name making it hard to verify his status from the available evidence could be added but I would hesitate to do so because no conclusion other than unknown or no evidence is really supported.
</p><p>Richard William Cumpston. The no evidence conclusion remains the same. There is no need to add anything. The first new sentence adds nothing to the identification; that a Union soldier had the same name is not relevant to a Confederate claim.
</p><p>William Loudermilk. No evidence to probable. The evidence does not support Loudermilk being a probable oldest Confederate veteran because there is no proof that he served in the army at all. Also, there is an indication in the birth date column that he may have been too young to have served. His claim is largely stated in the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.couchgenweb.com/civilwar/cwvet.htm">'Couch genealogy web site'</a> by a Mike Polston, who is otherwise unidentified. He supports Loudermilk's story despite the problems he himself raised. Also, Polston's narrative does not appear to be very credible. Loudermilk supposedly joined up, from his home in North Carolina, "after he had witnessed the burning of Southern property by the invading army under the command of General William Sherman." He could not have witnessed such burning if he fought at Chattanooga as stated by Polston because this was before the Atlanta campaign and the March to the Sea. Moreover, Sherman did not reach North Carolina until the last weeks of the war. The 6th North Carolina Cavalry Regiment did not fight at any of the battles mentioned in the article. The muster rolls do not support his claim. One cannot presume the claim is correct just because some names could have been or were missing from those rolls. The missing names could have been anybody. That is a perfect cover for an unverifiable claim, that is, what might have been missing. A descendant who states that "he served the CSA" without any documentation is not a reliable source because she has an obvious interest and because the phrase could even mean he served the Confederate States in some capacity, not necessarily in the army. The article states that he could not prove his age or military service. Excuses for this are not verifiable proof. They provide no basis for saying his service status was anything other than "no evidence." It appears to me that his story does not add up to any service at all. His believed birth date in the earlier version of the article is 1851, likely too late to have served.
</p><p>William Jordan Bush. Probable to Verified. This is interesting because the earlier status in the article does not line up with Marvel's general conclusion. You reference William <b>Joshua</b> Bush as the name under which the record comes up. Do these two names refer to the same person? If not, William <b>Jordan</b> Bush may be unverified. If so, do Marvel or any other source such as Hoar give any information about or analysis of his status? I think some reconciliation of the names is necessary. Also, some explanation of what the main writers on the subject say, if anything, about his status is important. If neither Marvel nor Hoar support Bush's status as probable, much less verified, is there any basis for it available?
</p><p>Arnold Murray. Debunked to Possible. You list him as possible but you acknowledge that there were others of the same name who served. You suggest that the 1854 birth date was not too young to have served. You state that Confederates had soldiers as young as 11. This is no proof for the service any specific individual. Any soldiers that young were probably drummers and due to the size and weight of weapons of that era, the number of young soldiers under the age of about 16 can either be exaggerated due to legend or wrongly implied to be combat soldiers when they simply performed behind the lines tasks. Historian E. B. Long states that the Union Army only had 1,290 soldiers between the ages of 13 and 15. While the Confederates had a more pressing need for manpower, Breckenridge's reluctance to use the VMI cadets in 1864 is a good indication of Confederate feeling against using underage soldiers. Young children could not have been of much use in combat. Regardless, the argument is too conjectural to support a probable status for this claimant. Certainly Marvel's conclusion would not be in line with it. I think that attendance at a reunion 48 years after the end of the war is not necessarily inconsistent with a person being a fraud because the chance of being recognized as such would be much less with the passage of time and the care about what he said while attending.
</p><p>William Townsend. Possible to Verified. I cannot tell whether the information you cite refers to the same person who later claimed to be a Confederate veteran. I think it could be used in a footnote to support the claim as possible, but not as verified. Again, I think that Marvel's and perhaps Hoar's conclusions have to be distinguished if they do not come to the same conclusion as to Townsend. We also have here the question of where did the previous "possible" conclusion originate and what was it based on? I think the change in the conclusion may not be supported but even if not, some justification for the possible status could be given if it is based on facts, not inferences and synthesis.
</p><p>William Albert Kinney. Debunked to Verified. If, as you write ,"Professor Jay S. Hoar presents evidence arguing that Kiney was a genuine veteran in his The South's last Boys in Gray: Last Living Chapter of the American Civil War pages 1700-1703" and that is his conclusion, your change has support. But if Hoar presents both sides and either actually accepts the other conclusion that his claim is debunked or draws no definite conclusion, there seems to be no other reliable source to support the change of Kinney's to verified. Does Marvel say anything specific about him in his magazine article? If so, this will need to be included and distinguished from Hoar's conclusion if it can be done from the two articles. Marvel include him in his blanket debunked conclusion. If the "other side" of the argument that you mention is not Marvel, who is it? Is a spelling difference to the last name crucial to the conclusion, and if so, do the one or more sources mention it in a way that aids the conclusion? Or does it leave the possibility that more than one person is being identified. If the distinction is that there was a real Confederate veteran and an imposter of the same name, does Hoar make that clear? By the time you have gone through your explanation with various expressed doubts or other possibilites, I no longer see the conclusion as verified. If Hoar verifies it, much of the following text should be eliminated. Your final statement that he did not seek a pension so he had no motive to fake his status is simply speculation. Pride alone could have been a motive. Without more, I think that any status other than debunked must be based on Hoar's conclusion, which you do not yet express in detail.
</p><p>Thomas Riddle. Possible to Verified. Your explanation actually contradicts your conclusion. If Lowry, who researched and wrote about the regiment, doubts Riddle's claim and there are several persons who had that name and might have been the veteran, there is no support for the conclusion that a Thomas Riddle has been verified as a veteran who outlived Crump. In fact, Lowry seems to support a downgrading of the Riddle status to dubious.
</p><p>William Lundy. Debunked to Unlikely. Your explanation gives no evidence at all to change Lundy's status. It appears to me that your discussion actually supports the original conclusion but that most or all of it is not includible.
</p><p>John B. Salling. Debunked to Dubious. This is a hard one because the Department of Veterans Affairs apparently continues to support Salling's claim. One problem with Salling's story is that even if he actually did mine for saltpetre and was on standby to be a Home Guard, there appears to be no evidence that he was actually enrolled in a Confederate army unit. He had no uniform and apparently never came close to combat. Perhaps with an explanation and a citation to the Department of Veteran Affairs page, a change in the conclusion could be justified or at least it would be reasonable to note it even if there is no reason to view it as conclusive. Again, Hoar and Marvel must be mentioned and distinguished if possible because presumably they reject the conclusion that Salling was a legitimate veteran.
</p><p>Walter W. Williams. Debunked to Dubious. It is difficult to see how Washington's status can be changed when many sources, including Hoar and Marvel and Serrano apparently, consider his claim to have been debunked. Hoar may state the other side's argument with some open mindedness but does he actually conclude that Williams may have been a veteran or is he just explaining why others might still think so?
</p><p>With respect to Townsend and Kinney, in particular, you may have some material that can support the possibility of their claim being something more than debunked. Factual material  may be usefully included for any of the claimants if stated in terms of facts established by reliable sources without the original analysis and synthesis. Readers must draw their own conclusions if sources simply state some facts or possibilites unless the sources draw conclusions. None of them do make such conclusions as near as I can tell, but you do attribute a possible conclusion to Hoar that might be important if it can be supported with direct language from Hoar. 
</p><p>Some writers would put the type of information under review into the text but I think your approach here is better under the circumstances. It allows the text, which is the general discussion, to remain mostly the same and without controversial statements. You can provide appropriate additional information without analysis or speculation in the footnotes for the readers' consideration. 
</p><p>So I think some room for explanation and reference to the few other available secondary sources is available. The information that remains after the synthesis and speculation are removed should be written more like a report on existing information rather than an analysis and conclusions based on a sythesis of the researched sources.
</p><p>I am sorry that this explanation and analysis has reached this length. I am also sorry to have to trouble you with this. I would not do so if I did not appreciate your work and think that at least a part of it can be included in the article. Also, I think that if you can come up with answers to some of the questions I have asked with reference to the sources, that may prove to be added as well. I must say that I have to reach the conclusion that as admirable as your work might be, much of it simply does not fit within the guidelines I set out above.
</p><p>I don't expect you to respond or to change everything in a day or two. But I think it is only fair to say I do not believe that the article can remain as it is indefinitely. I think that you can either respond to me or set to work on making changes. If we can not work this out, along with any other interested editors, I may edit the article. I don't want to have an edit war whether I edit it once or not. The next step would be to put something like this message on the talk page and to solicit other views. If that did not resolve the issue, some neutral administrator might need to resolve it after notification, possibly on the appropriate notice board. If nothing happens, I will ask you later in the month about the status of this.
</p><p>Again, I appreciate your effort and your industry in coming up with some interesting arguments. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Donner60" title="User:Donner60">Donner60</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Donner60" title="User talk:Donner60">talk</a>) 07:24, 10 September 2014 (UTC)

<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>I placed the message on the user talk page on September 10. No edits have been made from that IP address or to the article since that date. I thought I might place the message on the user's mobile IP address from which he made many of his edits. I saw that it must be a dynamic address or he was editing from various places because there were several changes in it. So I did not place the message again. I noticed that at first the user was referring to the work of a certain person. I tracked that down and saw the person was a contributor to find a grave and popped up in one or two more places online. It seems he is an amateur researcher doing his own work. I doubt it is the same person but I think he is not a reliable source. That explains some of the changes. Another IP had posted an objection on the talk page in July. I did not see it but today left a message that we had cautioned the user and I had recently left a long message for him. I plan to revert the original research and perhaps make a few changes to the article within about a week since the message has been posted 12 days already and a few more days should be enough allowance of time for a reply. Although I am interested in American Civil War history, I too have only a passing interest in this obscure subject. Nonetheless, the original research and speculation should be removed even though it has taken some time to do it carefully and with some consideration. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Donner60" title="User:Donner60">Donner60</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Donner60" title="User talk:Donner60">talk</a>) 21:57, 22 September 2014 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>I have started a new version of the article without reference to the existing version or older versions. I will make a comparison with the current content before I post a new version for the purpose of not inadvertently deleting anything significant. I assume it will be about the same length as the current article because there are only a few reliable sources. I intend to include as many citations as possible to head off disputes. I have a large collection of books on the American Civil War, including one of Marvel's books. I may stop at the library within the next few days to see if I can read a copy of Marvel's magazine article, and perhaps look at the Hoar and Serrano books if the library has copies of those books. It is an obscure topic of limited interest but keeping such original research as now corrupts the article out of Wikipedia is the point despite the expenditure of time which could be spent on more important content. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Donner60" title="User:Donner60">Donner60</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Donner60" title="User talk:Donner60">talk</a>) 09:33, 2 October 2014 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dl><dd>Apologies for the long delay in replying, but I have been away for a week. Thank you for all your efforts, I see nothing wrong with your revised version, although I do think we will have to keep a watch on the article in case of further unsourced or OR edits.

<dl><dd><dl><dd>No problem. I have been away for a few days as well. I appreciate your review.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>I might add that the Blue &amp; Gray magazine is not available at any local library so I could not read Marvel's original article. Hoar's book and Serrano's book are available at two different libraries, each about 15 miles in different directions from my home. I wish I had the extra details but I think I have enough from Marvel's books and other sources. A few of those sources provide some quotes or material from these sources, and I have duly attributed the quotes to them. Reviews appear to indicate that Serrano's conclusions are in line with Marvel's. Hoar may have a few differences but I note that "Volume 3" of Hoar's work seems to be a revised version of his original work. Only our original researcher quotes his work in support of one or two claimants, although I read Marvel's reference to Hoar to imply that Hoar might support one of the claims.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>I put the footnote in about the web site which states that Marvel did not express an opinion on each claimant. He certainly discredits them all in his later works and the web site only implies that one of the claimants in particular might be legitimate and does not definitely support any of them. The web site has the table of names, but that may have come from an earlier version of the article. I thought I should include this to prevent someone from bringing up the source and distorting it. I removed the status column because I can not determine where any conclusions other than debunked (or maybe no evidence) may have originated and leaving it in the article is only likely to produce the type of changes we are trying to avoid.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>I would not be surprised if all the sources of any note at all which touch on this topic have been included in the revision.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>The user who worked on it also included a few others but if I did not include them I considered them of little help or questionable reliability. That indicates to me this is a topic of minor interest and few, if any, other sources exist or are likely to be produced.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>You are right that this will need to be monitored because the person or few people interested in changing the conclusions well may be back. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Donner60" title="User:Donner60">Donner60</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Donner60" title="User talk:Donner60">talk</a>) 04:07, 22 October 2014 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>I posted this on my talk page already, but here you go:
</p><p>If you want <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Country_dialects" class="mw-redirect" title="West Country dialects">West Country dialects</a> to be unnecessarily wordy, difficult to read and difficult to understand for the average person, that's fine with me.  The average person would not understand that article, or at least not the phonology section, as it stands now.  The same is true of many Wikipedia articles about varieties of English.  But do what you want.  It doesn't bother me.  There's more to my life than this.  
</p><p>P.S. Looking at the history of West Country dialects, I see that one <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Wolfdog" title="User:Wolfdog">"Wolfdog"</a> has made many edits to that article in the past few months without citing any sources; yet neither you nor anyone else undid any of those edits or left a "threatening" comment on his talk page.  Why is that?  I'm just curious.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/174.56.160.47" title="Special:Contributions/174.56.160.47">174.56.160.47</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:174.56.160.47" title="User talk:174.56.160.47">talk</a>) 09:44, 26 September 2014 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>Frankly, you have already stated "There's more to my life than this", so I cannot see why you have again raised this subject. You mention <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Wolfdog" title="User:Wolfdog">"Wolfdog"</a> contributions, as I see it their latest contributions contain the appropriate references.  Your editing history  in Wikipedia hardly appears to be constructive and you need to explain any constructive(?) edits you make. The comment I made was not threatening, but just a response to your edit and poor editing history. Case closed. <a href="User%253ADavid_J_Johnson.html" title="User:David J Johnson">David J Johnson</a> (<a href="User_talk%253ADavid_J_Johnson.html#top" title="User talk:David J Johnson">talk</a>) 10:15, 26 September 2014 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>I can raise this subject again if I choose to.  There's still more to my life than this.  I don't think Wolfdog cited sources for all of his edits, but in any case, my point still stands about West Country dialects (and most articles about varieties of English on this website) being impossible to understand for the vast majority of people.  I can understand them just fine, but I'm talking about most people.  The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet" title="International Phonetic Alphabet">International Phonetic Alphabet</a> is just not something the vast majority of people, educated or not, know.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>My (and the people who share this computer with me's) editing history should be irrelevant.  The only thing that should be relevant when I edit an article is whether or not I cite my sources.  The same standard should apply to everyone, whether they're "logged in" or not.  But from what I've seen here, it doesn't seem like it does.  That's what bothers me.  If you say that making unsourced edits is wrong, then it should be wrong no matter who does it.  As long as that's the case, I'm happy.  Even if I had made a silly edit or two in the past, that would in no way prove that I was incapable of making serious, constructive ones.  I didn't feel threatened by your comment at all.  I never feel threatened by comments from Wikipedians or anyone else on the internet for that matter.

<dl><dd>Quite simply, your edits are not an improvement to a featured article, only your own POV.  There are far too many references to "Bundy" in your "revisions".

<p>David,
</p><p>With respect, both terms terms are not equally correct. M16 is a populism that the service has acknowledged but clearly as an unofficial term. MI6 only had brief official currency during WW2. On their website they clearly say: "Although the title fell into official disuse it remains in common use outside SIS".  Note emphasis on 'outside SIS', with SIS being the service's own term for itself in those very words. 
</p><p>The organisation clearly does not view it as anything other than a popular term. Wikipedia articles are encyclopedic and should be using the correct terminology. It also makes no sense to use M16 as if the official name in this section when the rest of the article uses the correct SIS.

</p><p>Firstly, please place your contribution in the correct place and NOT under footnotes. Also please do not lecture me on Wikipedia being "encyclopedic", I have been here long enough to know what we stand for. Both MI5 and MI6 have incorporated these names into their official logos and the above names are used by all sections of the media, including the BBC. HM Government's various websites also include MI5, MI6 in the logos. The result of your logic is that all references to MI5 should changed to "Security Service", clearly unnecessary - as is your edit.

</p><p>David,
</p><p>My apologies for the misplacing, I'm not sure how I did that! As for the matter under discussion, I wrote my note to you in a perfectly civil manner, so there is no need for an intemperate reply. I was not lecturing you at all, simply stressing that the encyclopedic aspect must surely place most emphasis on using the correct terms over popularisms, however well known. SIS's logo has MI6 in a clearly subordinate position. Their website throughout makes it very clear that their official and prefered name is SIS/Secret Intelligence Service. And, yes, there is a very good case for changing primary (my emphasis) use of MI5 within articles to Security Service within an encyclopedia such as this, as the same relationship between the two terms applies, although the use of MI5 has much longer currency So my edit was not certainly clearly unnecessary. You haven't argued why this one section should use MI6 when the article overall stresses the offical name. It seems incongruous when reading.

<dl><dd><dl><dd>Suggest your read the article text again as MI6 is mentioned. MI6 is part of the logo and is not in "subordinate position", as others have also told you.  My reply was not "intemperate"; just a reply to your rather pompous manner. That is not the way we operate at Wikipedia. Could I also respectfully suggest you check your contributions before posting - apart from placing them in the wrong position - there are spelling mistakes (or should I say "mastikes"?) Case closed.

<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>I have to agree with David here. As I have pointed out on my talk page on the exact same topic, the service states twice on their own homepage that they are "often known as MI6". This text is supported by the use of MI6 as one of the elements of their logo. I am all for encyclopaedic exactitude, but where hairs are needlessly split for the sake of it it goes beyond being reasonably constructive. - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:SchroCat" title="User:SchroCat">SchroCat</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:SchroCat" title="User talk:SchroCat">talk</a>) 15:18, 26 November 2014 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>Fair enough; I was simply making my case, and I would stand by it not be a case of splitting hairs, but I do see your point about the service's usage of it within the logo and elsewhere, and will leave it be at that. No lecturing or any other such intended at all, apologies if it came across that way. Regards,

<p>Hi David, I noticed your revert on <a href="Arecibo_message.html" title="Arecibo message">Arecibo message</a>. Actually, the reflector on the Arecibo telescope is spherical, not parabolic, so the edit was probably good. I think to state that the message portrays a parabolic reflector would need a source. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:MidnightBlueMan" title="User:MidnightBlueMan"><font color="DarkBlue"><b>MidnightBlue</b></font></a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:MidnightBlueMan" title="User talk:MidnightBlueMan"><font color="Blue"><b>(Talk)</b></font></a> 19:16, 9 February 2015 (UTC)

<dl><dd>Thank you MidnightBlue, I tend to agree with what you have said, although I thought it was parabolic. My concern was that the edit was made without any explanation or references/sources.

<dl><dd>No problem. I wonder whether "curved reflector" would be adequate. I haven't found anywhere that specifies the nature of the reflector in the binary pattern. And maybe reflector rather than mirror?

<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><small>(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Talk_page_stalker" title="Wikipedia:Talk page stalker">talk page stalker</a>)</small> Pardon me for butting in, but I wrote a piece about the Arecibo telescope some years ago when my son was at Cornell (which ran the facility until recently).   It is indeed spherical, because it has to be.  Most radio-telescopes are parabolic; they are steered by moving the entire dish until its axis and its fixed-position receiver are aligned with the target. But Arecibo's dish is immovable -- it's simply too big to move -- so if it were a parabola, it would only be accurate when the target was directly overhead.  To aim at targets off the vertical, only the receiver can be moved, and a spherical reflector allows uniform reception over the entire range of the receiver's movement.  Further, in my completely unsolicited opinion, "reflector" is preferable to "mirror" when describing any radio-telescope, and "sphere" is preferable to "curved" in this article because the specific (spherical) shape is an important distinction in describing this particular receiver. For whatever any of this is worth. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:DoctorJoeE" title="User:DoctorJoeE"><font color="green">DoctorJoeE</font></a>&#160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/DoctorJoeE" title="Special:Contributions/DoctorJoeE"><sup><font color="maroon">review transgressions</font></sup></a>/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:DoctorJoeE" title="User talk:DoctorJoeE"><font color="maroon"><sub>talk to me!</sub></font></a> 05:02, 10 February 2015 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>Hi David J Johnson.
</p><p>Re your <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ted_Bundy&amp;oldid=648168871&amp;diff=prev">revert</a> of my edit to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Bundy" title="Ted Bundy">Ted Bundy</a>, the 2 links are not central to the article obviously but certainly don't seem to me to detract from the article.

</p>
<dl><dd>Quite simply and as already mentioned, they do not add anything to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Bundy" title="Ted Bundy">Ted Bundy</a> article, and are just overlinking. There have been plenty of additions to this article which have been reversed because they have not been central or relevant to the subject. Several editors have worked extremely hard to get the article to its present condition and I have no wish, and will take action, to "edits" that are not in any way useful additions to the subject.

<p>Looking at the minor edit scuffle at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckinghamshire" title="Buckinghamshire">Buckinghamshire</a> from the outside, I have to say I agree with the reversions.

<dl><dd>Hello John, I tend to agree with you. It was not material I added, it was already there. What I did object to was the arrogance of the "editor", who has a very poor history, deleting it.

<dl><dd>Strange as it may seem, when I wrote that I hesitated, thinking 'why am I doing this? Surely the editor who chopped it is the one who should be doing it?'

<p>Rape is non-consensual sex and sex is generally associated with love and emotions, not with violence. Sexual violence is impossible. For films and television programs, it's not likely to be acceptable, it's questionable, it's morally violent. Besides, there is no rape scene and the DVD cover of the film is rated U.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/81.155.98.249" title="Special:Contributions/81.155.98.249">81.155.98.249</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:81.155.98.249" title="User talk:81.155.98.249">talk</a>) 20:16, 20 May 2015 (UTC)

<p>I think Lucy wasn't raped. I think the Indians just murdered Lucy and took her dress just after they killed her, before Ethan found her dead, wrapped her in his blanket and buried her. When Brad saw a buck wearing Lucy's dress and thought it was Lucy and Ethan told her what really happened to her, I think Brad's two questions were going to be 'Did they kill her?' and 'Was she killed?'.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/81.155.98.249" title="Special:Contributions/81.155.98.249">81.155.98.249</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:81.155.98.249" title="User talk:81.155.98.249">talk</a>) 18:13, 21 May 2015 (UTC)

<dl><dd>That is purely conjecture on your part and, once again, it is POV on your part. Your POV is not backed-up by all the reviews and books on the subject. As other editors have told you Wikipedia is not censored and your many edits are trying to do just that. I repeat that your alterations will continue to be reverted and if you continue the various IPs you edit from will be blocked. That is the end of my conversation with you.

<p>Thanks for the ping thanks D. You have already seen my edit and you may already be aware of this so apologies if I am repeating stuff. When reporting IPs (or named users for that matter) if you use this template {{user|XXXXX}} this allows other editors to access their talk page and contributions right away. That way they don't have to use the search function to track them down. If you have any questions feel free to post here as I have your talk page on my watchlist.Let me also add a big THANKS for all you are doing to track this person from Northern Ireland. They are deeply disturbed or they are trolling WikiP. In either case your vigilance is much appreciated.

<p>Hi,<br />
Thanks for your input. Just thought that the category <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Murder_in_California" title="Category:Murder in California">Murder in California</a> was incomplete, as these murders are known for taking place in California.<br />
You will note that very specific categories exist for the page <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zodiac_Killer" title="Zodiac Killer">Zodiac Killer</a>, such as <i>History of Napa County, California</i> / <i>News stories in Riverside County, California</i> / <i>Vallejo, California</i> / <i>History of Riverside, California</i> / <i>Criminals of the San Francisco Bay Area</i> / <i>Crimes in the San Francisco Bay Area</i>.<br />
I leave it to you to estimate if my proposition of a broader category should also be included.<br />
Best,<br />

<p>When someone is executed by decree of a court with jurisdiction over the proceding in accordance with the standing state constitution, it is a Judicially sanctioned execution, not a Homicide. Bundy commiting homicide was why he got to ride the lightning so to speak. That's why it was changed. Have you personally reviewed his death certificate? Personally I could really care less what some Medical Examiner put on a death certificate. A homicide is a malicious criminal act. A judicially sanctioned execution obviously does not fall into the category.

<dl><dd>The only new statement added seems to be that the house move by Maureen and David Smith was on 23rd Hindley's birthday. I can't actually check that, as I don't have a copy of the Ritchie book to hand. But not sure why anyone would make that up. That ip seems to have made useful improvements to other articles?

<p>Mr. Johnson:
</p><p>Your revert of my minor edit at John Ford's site and the one-word rationale you provided are both inaccurate and rude. His religion isn't referenced anywhere else in the article, therefore, to link "Roman Catholic" to "Catholic Church" is no more an example of "overlinking" than the existing link of "Commander" to the Wiki article that elaborates on that naval rank. My addition of the link was objective - beyond reproach. Your revert was subjective - made with rude autonomy.
</p><p>I'm reinserting the link. If you feel otherwise, please contact me on my talk page so we can discuss the matter. If you revert again without first inviting a conversation, I'll look forward to inviting an Editor to weigh in on the matter, for certainly you have a long and troubling record of treating other Wikipedians with similar disdain.

</p><p>Mr. Johnson:
</p><p>I beg your pardon. After re-reading "Early life" for John Ford, I see that his Roman Catholicism is referenced in the last paragraph of that heading. I do apologize. Nevertheless, don't you agree that the reference is oblique insofar as it concerns the supposed difficulty his Roman Catholicism may have presented with respect the validity of his marriage and the pursuit of other romances?  As an aside, the many footnoted observations questioning Ford's Catholicity are generally misleading and ungermane. That Peter Bogdanovich had any idea of how often Ford attended Mass is ridiculous; and even if he did, Mass attendance is not the sole measure of one's commitment to the Catholic faith.  Additionally, Mary (McBride) Ford may have had her prior marriage annulled (we certainly don't know, do we?), thereby removing the suggested complication that is only vaguely footnoted with "Christianity Today."  Lastly, extramarital affairs do not speak to one's Catholicity - rather, they speak to the Catholic Church's view of sin, which the Church both expects and provides redress.
</p><p>I believe the Wikilink to "Catholic Church" in the bio box is proper; however, if you feel otherwise, I won't protest a second revert removing the link.

I agree the sentence probably read better before my change, but the "although" is what gave me pause. Does that word not indicate to you in that context that Portland stone is not oolitic limestone? While the "Geological information" section clearly indicates that "...countless billions of these balls, known as "ooids" or "ooliths" (from the Greek for "egg-shaped" or "egg-stone"), became partially cemented together (or lithified) by more calcite, to form the oolitic limestone we now call Portland Stone."  Now that I look at it again, I should have left the "the" in after my "and" when I made the change. But I guess the entire assertion that Oxford typically does use oolitic limestone in its building construction is unsourced, and therefore could be removed, anyway.

<p>Excuse me, but the last time I looked at the official Conservative website George Osborne was the deputy leader of the Conservative Party, as of the 8th May, after succeeding William Hague. So all I was doing was adding knowledge, which is correct. So if you had a problem with that you should take it up with the Conservatives!

<p>David: Thank you for the greeting and alert. I occasionally have looked at the page but not recently enough to see the new activity. I am surprised, and a bit disturbed, the a longstanding Wikipedia user has picked up on this false trail. My guess is that this is not the same person who made the previous edits. Nonetheless, the table is similar as is the content. While I do not think the previous researchers were necessarily infallible, it is clear that Mr. Washington was a fraud and even if one or two Confederate veterans survived after Mr. Crump, no definitive proof has turned up as far as I know. In view of the fact that the current editor is a confirmed user, I thought it would be courteous and correct to alert him to the change. Since I did not revert the edits based on an automated program that would leave a message, I left him the following message:
</p>
<dl><dd>"I have undone your additions to this article for the reasons stated in my edit summary. I have not done this on the basis of vandalism but due to original research and synthesis and because the changes are questionable (common names in register of soldiers do not prove that a later claimant was the same person; no birth dates or other connecting information). Also, they are contrary to the sources shown in the references which are based on research and investigation. One instance shows how unlikely these changes are. If Walter Washington was born on the date he claimed, he would have been older than the oldest man ever verified to have lived. If I had not left this special message, you would have received no notification unless you were watching the article. I think that would have been unfair to you. I do not want to engage in any sort of edit war over this so if you wish to carry this on, we can refer it to the Military History Committee or some other previously uninvolved editor or editors."</dd></dl>
<p>I hope this will lead to a civil handling of this. I am confident that members of the Military History project or other neutral editors would not accept such original research without true connecting sources, which is why I made the offer to refer it. A person who realizes their edits have a shaky basis will not accept such an offer so I will proceed to refer the matter myself rather than get into an argument over it. I hope you will find this to be a satisfactory way to proceed.

As long as the old thread had become, and because this seems to be a "restart" of the whole matter after some considerable time had passed, I thought it better to start a new thread. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Donner60" title="User:Donner60">Donner60</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Donner60" title="User talk:Donner60">talk</a>) 03:48, 25 January 2016 (UTC)
</p><p>Perhaps I should have looked at this first: The editor had quite a few edits up to 2008, then one in 2010, and has just recently resumed editing, concentrating on articles about "oldest" people, not just this one. I guess that is another reason to conclude this is a different person. I suppose it is no reason to regret leaving a special message. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Donner60" title="User:Donner60">Donner60</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Donner60" title="User talk:Donner60">talk</a>) 03:54, 25 January 2016 (UTC)

<dl><dd>I viewed User talk:Bart Versieck just now and there is a response stating "Thanks for the feedback in fact, and maybe it's a good idea to do just that actually." I just responded, about seven hours later: I will prepare a question to them soon and let you know when I am posting it. If you prefer to proceed differently, let me know." I will go ahead after allowing some time for a response. If this is going to be a recurring problem, perhaps this expenditure of time will help put the matter to rest, or at least allow quick and sure reversion of any further efforts to add this material. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Donner60" title="User:Donner60">Donner60</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Donner60" title="User talk:Donner60">talk</a>) 03:24, 26 January 2016 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>I left this further message on User talk:Bart Versieck. I am glad I did not seek resolution from the WikiProject or some other venue since there are preliminary steps or requirements which need to be fulfilled. I would have stated this as a continuing dispute with various editors over the same proposed revisions. That might have been enough but a more cautious approach would seem to put the matter in a better position for resolution. Perhaps Mr. Versieck may even be persuaded to cease his efforts to add the dubious material. Sorry for the long drawn out messages and process but I want to keep you advised and also to be sure this is done right. It is not worth escalating into some sort of big dispute which will reflect badly on the participants or hinder a resolution.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>"I thought I should step back and again read the Wikipedia guideline pages on dispute resolution, which I have not reviewed recently. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Dispute_resolution#Discuss_with_the_other_party" title="Wikipedia:Dispute resolution">Wikipedia:Dispute resolution#Discuss with the other party</a> suggests that we would be proceeding too quickly under the guidelines to refer this to a third party, committee or noticeboard immediately. This section of the dispute resolution page requires negotiation between the parties to a dispute and then "Talk page discussion is a prerequisite to almost all of Wikipedia's venues of higher dispute resolution." I think we should proceed as indicated and in a manner that will convince third parties that they should become involved in settling any disagreement that we may have. We should not proceed to ask for opinions for a Wikiproject or noticeboard before taking these preliminary steps.</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>"Please note that considerable discussion on this is already on the talk page due to previous efforts to insert similar material.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>"I think it is unlikely that our previous communications will convince others that we have gone through the preliminary procedures. Rather than just refer you to the talk page - although I may do that in part rather than repeat all the detail - I propose to write a summary of the reasons why I think the additions or changes should not be made to the page and place it here on your talk page. You can respond as you believe fit. If we reject each other's positions, and if we do not in turn suggest some sort of compromise language, then we should place the matter on the article's talk page for possible resolution before moving on to the next step.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>"I will check back tomorrow to see if you agree to this proposal or wish to proceed differently. I will finish by saying that I do not think we need to limit ourselves to one set of exchanges of views if further comment might seem productive." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Donner60" title="User:Donner60">Donner60</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Donner60" title="User talk:Donner60">talk</a>) 06:56, 26 January 2016 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>Mr. Versieck expressed general agreement although he mentioned that definite statements on some of the claimants may not be possible. I am not sure exactly what he meant (whether he would not give up on some claimant or claimants or whether there is a "possible" category, for example) but I said I would examine the citations and sources with the idea of writing a fresh statement. I also wrote that perhaps some compromise language could be drafted if any new or recent evidence revived or partially revived some claims - despite Mr. Marvel's rejection of them all. I doubt that any claimant can be verified because I think the basis almost certainly must be considered original research. While I also doubt that a possible category can be established, I do believe that some compromise language as to a few of them, if it can in fact be drafted, might settle the matter without having to take it to others. I very much doubt that any claimant who could be classified as possible can be upgraded to verified or even probable based on what I saw in my quick review of the sources. My message to him was a bit more detailed but this was the gist plus some interpretation or comment. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Donner60" title="User:Donner60">Donner60</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Donner60" title="User talk:Donner60">talk</a>) 05:50, 27 January 2016 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>I just left this message on Mr. Versieck's talk page. I would like to complete this quickly but I want to be careful. Also I do not want to, or cannot, ignore or put off some real life chores while doing this. "I have created a new user subpage entitled <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Donner60/sandbox2" title="User:Donner60/sandbox2">User:Donner60/sandbox2</a>. I will develop the presentation there rather than offline so you can check on progress if you wish. So far I have put large excerpts from two Wikipedia policy pages on this page. It seems to me that the expression of Wikipedia principles to be used in the evaluation would be a good opening for a "paper" on this topic. As it stands, this is far too much on these principles and I will try to cut it back while preserving the original meaning, probably by preserving direct quotes if I can. I hope to make more progress over the weekend." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Donner60" title="User:Donner60">Donner60</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Donner60" title="User talk:Donner60">talk</a>) 07:22, 30 January 2016 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>Mr. Versieck left a message "Keep up the good work, my friend" after my last message to him - and then proceeded to restore his edit with a few little comments as well. I am not sure how to take this. I think he may have become impatient. Perhaps he has realized from looking at the Wikipedia policy pages. set out at length in my draft, the talk page of the article and my brief exposition on his talk page, that his position is tenuous. Then perhaps he thinks he can succeed by being persistent or taking his chance with third parties who might weigh in to resolve the matter. This has become tedious and I had hoped to have enough time to prepare a full and perhaps final presentation without being pressed to defer other matters for as much as a few days. I do have some things to do and we have been over this before as the talk page shows. In any event, I left the following message on his talk page. If you have any opinion about the turn this has taken or my comment, please let me know. I wrote:</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>"I see that you were not willing to wait and restored flawed, or at least quite questionable, edits to the article. I assume you did not refer to the principles on my draft page or on the Wikipedia policy pages before you did so, but it so, you can state why you think the edits are in line with them. If you are not willing to wait for a full exposition of this, perhaps I should not waste my time and we should present it immediately to third parties as unresolvable between us. I do feel that your additions have some serious problems. Connecting names in the census with names on a list of soldiers without a sure connection of the same birth date is speculative as it was not uncommon for several people in extended families who were born around the same date to have the same name.  Speculative comments such as "so far" imply a forthcoming conclusion that is not supported by any sources and has no place in what is supposed to be a statement of facts based on reliable sources. Historians such as William Marvel, a reliable third-party source (in line with Wikipedia guidelines) has rejected these arguments and other sources in the footnotes support his conclusions. Where is the reliable and verifiable secondary source that accepts that some of the claimants that died later were confirmed as Confederate veterans? If you do not want to accept a careful and detailed explanation for consideration and possible presentation to others, including a fair explanation of your position which you would be free to revise, then it seems we will not get very far in resolving this without calling in third parties. I will wait to hear from you. If you do not wish to proceed on a cooperative or combined basis, then I suppose we must say that we have been unable to proceed on the slower path set out above and I should prepare my own separate and detailed statement along the lines already started in this paragraph and existing on the article talk page. I do think it is counterproductive to insert material or for changes to be made to a previously well supported article based on original research and synthesis - unless you can show why it is not - until the matter is fully debated, or if necessary resolved by currently uninvolved editors. I will await your answer and look at the page over the next few days before I write much, if any, more." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Donner60" title="User:Donner60">Donner60</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Donner60" title="User talk:Donner60">talk</a>) 04:44, 31 January 2016 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>Thank you for all your work on this subject.  I much regret that I have little time at the moment, but I have reverted the latest "contributions" from this person.  I relly believe that the only action now is to refer these "edits" and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:OR" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:OR">WP:OR</a> to an admin.  To claim that previously debunked claiments; plus one, unsourced, who is claimed to have died in 1971, is total nonsense. On the strength of this I conclude that this person is not here to contribute to the encylopedia and should be reported. I'm out of contact for the next couple of days - at least.

<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>You are right. I wanted to do this "by the book" but I think it will have to go to the next stage. I still want to write it up carefully rather than to rely on a few sentences and a reference back to past postings. I understand that you can not drop everything to devote several hours to this nettlesome problem. I don't mind doing it but I would prefer not to have to drop everything and be rushed. Since Mr. Viersieck's patience seems to have been exhausted after only a few days, and despite seeming encouragement and cooperation, he now seems to be committed to an edit war if he can't get his way promptly. I could see his point if he really had a good case. I think that anyone who can read the original research and verification guideline pages objectively would have to be restrained for more time than this to see whether I can do a full presentation. I do believe I promised to present both sides. I do not think I promised to be persuaded. I also think I did not promise to settle for a changed version which I clearly disagreed with to be the version that people would see in the interim. If I wasn't entirely clear, I still can't see how he could have thought otherwise. Thanks for your diligence in watching this page and your support. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Donner60" title="User:Donner60">Donner60</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Donner60" title="User talk:Donner60">talk</a>) 03:05, 1 February 2016 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>I went back to see what Mr. Versieck had added. In his latest edit after your last revert, he has only added some minor language, a few nicknames for some of the veterans and a few minor changes in dates which he cites to census records. He left out the speculative phrases and the women's names (not sure where he came up with them). I left him a message saying that if he is content with just that, we have nothing more to consider. I suspect he will not be because the January 25 version that I reverted had all of the verification language for some of the claimants and other objectionable material we have seen before. I apologized because, I said, his more recent edits did not contain the same flaws. Therefore, they need not have led to the conclusions in my prior message. That does not mean this whole business has been unnecessary because we started out with quite objectionable additions again. I said I would continue with the writeup as before agreed if he still wanted to move forward, and certainly by implication, if he does not add back the more objectionable text. Perhaps upon your return there will be more said about this. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Donner60" title="User:Donner60">Donner60</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Donner60" title="User talk:Donner60">talk</a>) 04:19, 1 February 2016 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>I have been delayed in further responding to Mr. Versieck. He posted a message on my page about 10 hours ago. I responded as follows. You will note that he had remarked on the "strange person" phrase on my page and your previous reversion. That was some time ago so he had not really taken into account the later sequence of events. I hope the reply to him which I copy in next will put this in the proper perspective. I am not sure whether this will lead to some third party involvement or determination after all but perhaps we can keep it calm, especially if he does not restore the most controversial edits - at least if we proceed at a reasonable pace.</dd>
<dd>"I am sorry just to be getting back to you (on your talk page; this reply is to a posting only about 10 hours ago). I have investigated further but I have been sick for several days and not working very fast. I will look at your most recent citation before commenting. I ask that you give Mr. Johnson a little slack. He is in good faith and has monitored the article for quite some time. I had the same response when I thought you had restored an earlier more questionable version when in fact you had made a much smaller change to which I could not object. While he was unavailable, I looked at your last change more closely and saw that it was not as extensive or questionable, which is why I said I was sorry for the message I had left and did not change it further. I think he has been unavailable to see these developments."</dd>
<dd>"The latest version of the article still has your last two changes. I will say, preliminarily, that if I recall correctly, Garry Victor Hill cannot be considered a reliable source. If I remember correctly, he is an amateur researcher and uses speculation and coincidences rather than definite, connected sources that historians and researchers have not accepted in reliable secondary sources. I say this only to give you my recollection quickly. I do this because I have some confidence I will find this to be the case and I have been delayed in replying due to my limited time and energy in the past week. I will try to be more definite with a prompt follow-up reply." <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Donner60" title="User:Donner60">Donner60</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Donner60" title="User talk:Donner60">talk</a>) 03:58, 13 February 2016 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>Firstly, apologies, I had no idea what an "edit war" was and I had no idea I was causing one, and yes, I am wrong to assume that I am am right.  I would like to bring the page up to date whilst keeping within the guidlines that are, quite rightly, strictly enforced. My second apology is due because I hadn't initialy spotted the messages on the "talk" pages, i wasn't deliberatly ignoring the editors, was simply oblivious to the comments. I would be grateful if you could offer a good starting point.

<p>Hi, you reverted my edit on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Drake" title="Frank Drake">Frank Drake</a> with the following; "Revert to previous pic. Addition is reversed L to R." Why and what does that mean? the image is newer and clearer, and commons is usually placed under the external links. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:TherasTaneel&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:TherasTaneel (page does not exist)">TherasTaneel</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:TherasTaneel" title="User talk:TherasTaneel">talk</a>) 03:06, 10 July 2016 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>I thought it was absolutely obvious. The image you posted (which had been reverted before) has been reversed left to right and Frank does not have a parting on the right hand side. If we are going to place clearer images on a article page, please make sure they are in a correct format and not reversed. Regards, <a href="User%253ADavid_J_Johnson.html" title="User:David J Johnson">David J Johnson</a> (<a href="User_talk%253ADavid_J_Johnson.html#top" title="User talk:David J Johnson">talk</a>) 10:05, 10 July 2016 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Clearly it's not obvious as multiple users have done the same, as you say and I see now (having now seen the article history) it has been reverted before. Files on commons should either be free or deleted, so not usually a problem being reversed, though there is the issue about the parting in this case I suppose, albeit a minor one imo. What is meant by the vague "correct format" is unclear to me, but if another that feels more strongly than me about changing his image into a newer one, they can figure it out.

<dl><dd>You are, of course, correct. NATO and the United Nations are a multi-governmental organisations, but certainly not to be described as "non state actors".

I've been in this situation several times before, and I got my way each time.

<dl><dd><small>(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Talk_page_stalker" title="Wikipedia:Talk page stalker">talk page stalker</a>)</small> Pardon the intrusion, but if I may interject two points: (1) WP editing is not a competition; we tend to favor "getting it right" over "getting your way"; and (2) I'm going to suggest that the broader category, "deaths", is more accurate than "suicides", since only the hijackers were suicidal; the passengers and crew were innocent bystanders with (presumably) no wish to die. I'm assuming that "filmed suicides" is a sub-category of "filmed deaths"; if they are constructed as distinct categories, listing both would be more appropriate than one or the other. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:DoctorJoeE" title="User:DoctorJoeE"><font color="green">DoctorJoeE</font></a>&#160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/DoctorJoeE" title="Special:Contributions/DoctorJoeE"><sup><font color="maroon">review transgressions</font></sup></a>/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:DoctorJoeE" title="User talk:DoctorJoeE"><font color="maroon"><sub>talk to me!</sub></font></a> 15:51, 5 April 2017 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>Apologies for the delay in replying, but I've been away on urgent family business. DoctorJoeE has made exactly the same points that I would have made. I find your statement that "I got my way each time" borders on arrogance, Wikipedia is a collaboration and not a contest of who wins any edit. You are a fairly new editor and I respectfully suggest that you read various Wikipedia articles on correct editing. Personally, I object to the category "filmed suicides" as by far the deaths were of innocent passengers who had no wish to die. I'm happy with other category mentioned. <a href="User%253ADavid_J_Johnson.html" title="User:David J Johnson">David J Johnson</a> (<a href="User_talk%253ADavid_J_Johnson.html#top" title="User talk:David J Johnson">talk</a>) 19:41, 5 April 2017 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>Hello, David. You recently told me to use sandbox for editing first before I make it public, which I thank you for. If you could help with that, I'd greatly appreciate it. I'm new to Wikipedia and all its editing and such. However, I'm not arguing, are you stating where I attempted to put "intended destination" rather than just "destination"? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:2013AtlantaBraves&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:2013AtlantaBraves (page does not exist)">2013AtlantaBraves</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:2013AtlantaBraves" title="User talk:2013AtlantaBraves">talk</a>) 15:35, 19 August 2017 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>Thank you for your mail. You appeared to make a test edit and the sandbox is the place to do that, not the article itself. There are plenty of advice sites on Wikipedia dealing with advice to newcomers and that is where you should go. I regret that I'm far too busy myself to offer assistance.

<p>Hi, David. I tend to agree the symbol doesn't belong in the infobox (but then I think of other infamous serial killers who are unknown and what populates their infoboxes). The symbol should (in my own opinion) be used in the text of the article where mention of his correspondence first appears. Perhaps if the image of Zodiac which was circulated (and had him panicking and saying "I only look like that when committing my murders" or suchlike) could be uploaded to replace the "floating on its own" image then everyone can be content?

<p>Hiya mate,
Not going to edit my edit back into the 'Meteor Crater' article, just going to post this here so you can see for yourself that "few" is correct, rather than little (due to the concept in question being measurable)
<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://www.gingersoftware.com/content/grammar-rules/adjectives/few-vs-little/">http://www.gingersoftware.com/content/grammar-rules/adjectives/few-vs-little/</a>
"The meteorite was mostly vaporized upon impact, leaving little remains in the crater." Which is your preferred sentence, implies there were small fragments left over - whilst this is probably true, it's incorrect grammatically.
"The meteorite was mostly vaporized upon impact, leaving few remains in the crater." This is how you write it to explain there was not much remaining of the meteorite. 
Unless I misunderstood the intent of that sentence.

<dl><dd><small>(<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Talk_page_stalker" title="Wikipedia:Talk page stalker">talk page stalker</a>)</small> Technically, you are correct, of course -- but in modern usage, "little" and “few” are used interchangeably, as are "more" and "over", because in the vast majority of cases, everyone knows what you mean.  (Example: "The relic is over 300 years old".)  I was taught to be compulsive about grammatical minutiae too; but over the years I've found that in general, it's best to let your ear, and common sense, rather than a rigid rule, be your guide. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:DoctorJoeE" title="User:DoctorJoeE"><font color="green">DoctorJoeE</font></a>&#160;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/DoctorJoeE" title="Special:Contributions/DoctorJoeE"><sup><font color="maroon">review transgressions</font></sup></a>/<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:DoctorJoeE" title="User talk:DoctorJoeE"><font color="maroon"><sub>talk to me!</sub></font></a> 02:59, 14 May 2017 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<p>My apologies for leaving you out to dry a bit on that. I probably should have checked with you before conceding the point, but it became obvious that we were going to have to argue it every few months forever, and even though we were right, it just didn't seem worth the trouble.

<dl><dd>I've been away on a break for a few days - hence the lack of contributions.  Please don't worry about contacting me regarding conceding the point, it was probably all for the best.  Like you, I remain confused about the immature individual's "contributions", who now expects an apology for my revert and warning of his non-explanation of the COD revert. I was also struck by the other comments from editors who had not previously contributed to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Bundy" title="Ted Bundy">Ted Bundy</a> article. I remain concerned that the COD was properly referenced by both primary and secondary references and the deletion of these are a slippery slope for factual articles.

<p>Greetings, and happy December. I have been alerted to <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Great_Fire_of_Rome&amp;diff=804654188&amp;oldid=804611964">your revert</a> on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Fire_of_Rome" title="Great Fire of Rome">Great Fire of Rome</a>, and I investigated your claim that this was supported by the reference given in the article body. I scoured the source by using Google Books, and I found no documentation in it to support anything claimed in the section "Modern scholarship". In fact, that paragraph had been written in language that usually indicates <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:OR" class="mw-redirect" title="Wikipedia:OR">original research</a> on the part of the Wikipedia editor who originally contributed it. So I have removed both the sentence in the lede, as well as the whole "Modern scholarship" section. I did leave the reference intact, which is right now causing a cite error, but it is a high quality source, so perhaps it could be applied to something else in the same article. I hope this helps. Happy editing! <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/2600:8800:1880:C359:5604:A6FF:FE38:4B26" title="Special:Contributions/2600:8800:1880:C359:5604:A6FF:FE38:4B26">2600:8800:1880:C359:5604:A6FF:FE38:4B26</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:2600:8800:1880:C359:5604:A6FF:FE38:4B26" title="User talk:2600:8800:1880:C359:5604:A6FF:FE38:4B26">talk</a>) 07:17, 14 December 2017 (UTC)

This is one of many limitations of Wikidata, which basically can't cope with the fact that the breakdown of topics in one language's Wikipedia is liable to be different from the topic breakdown in another language.  (<i>In which case, of course it oughtn't to be trying to link to the redirect's target</i>.)  In my view that inability to cope with a different breakdown leaves the Wikidata concept (or at least its current implementation) fundamentally flawed.  On checking, I see that the redirect problem is vaguely mentioned at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Interlanguage_links#Local_links" title="Help:Interlanguage links">Help:Interlanguage links#Local links</a>, though I wouldn't have realised the significance if I hadn't been trying to do it. --<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:David_Biddulph" title="User:David Biddulph">David Biddulph</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:David_Biddulph" title="User talk:David Biddulph">talk</a>) 10:38, 18 January 2018 (UTC)

<p>How was what I added incorrect? DT1 and DT2 cover the Dorchester post town. To the best of my knowledge, this was the information that is put in the post town, postcode district etc. section on the infobox. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Samuel_J_Walker&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Samuel J Walker (page does not exist)">Samuel J Walker</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Samuel_J_Walker" title="User talk:Samuel J Walker">talk</a>) 19:41, 24 March 2018 (UTC)

<dl><dd>As another long-standing Dorset editor has already told you, the DT1 postcode is exclusive to Dorchester town proper.  DT2 is only used for the surrounding villages and area. As someone who has lived in Dorchester town for many years, I can confirm this. Isn't it about time you compiled a User page and restricted yourself to "editing" articles you know something about.

<p>Hello. The creation of the two new authorities and which coat of arms and motto they might use isn't the issue, its that they aren't used by Poole and Bournemouth and this articles covers the entire ceremonial county, not just the county council area. As it is, I think the infobox is misleading as it implies they are used by the entire county. I don't think it possible to add the arms and mottos of Poole and Bournemouth so wouldn't it be better to just omit the county council arms and motto? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:BarretB" title="User:BarretB">Barret</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:BarretB#top" title="User talk:BarretB">talk</a>) 17:17, 1 June 2018 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>Many thanks for yours. No, I don't agree; Poole and Bournemouth were until recent times part of Dorset County Council area. There are still many towns, villages and areas that are still part of the Dorset County Council proper.  Whilst I would have no objection to the arms of Poole and Bournemouth being added to the article, I still feel that for the relative short time that the County Council will exist, it is best to leave the coat of arms within the article - as it has been for ages now. Regards, <a href="User%253ADavid_J_Johnson.html" title="User:David J Johnson">David J Johnson</a> (<a href="User_talk%253ADavid_J_Johnson.html#top" title="User talk:David J Johnson">talk</a>) 18:40, 1 June 2018 (UTC)
<dl><dd>I still don't see why the non-metropolitan county should take precedence. The coat of arms was absent from this article until it was added with an update to the infobox template four years ago. Even when Poole and Bournemouth came under Dorset County Council administration they retained borough status which allowed them to continue to use their own coat of arms. But I think that's irrelevant anyway as they have been independent from DCC for over 21 years now. I've placed a new discussion on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Dorset" title="Talk:Dorset">Talk:Dorset</a> to see if any other editors have an opinion.

<p>I took a look at this again to see that some time ago the text concerning the definitive new source and the citation were deleted and some of the bogus claims were added back. I restored the last clean version, as far as I could tell, but tried to retain the technical changes and corrections of later edits (e.g. removal of "magic links" to ISBN and insertion of the new style). I suppose this will be never-ending as there seem to be many dedicated adherents to the fringe theories - with a few fringe and poorly reasoned sources in support. Maybe some sort of protection can be had at some point. You may have this watchlisted. If not, if you have time, you might want to review the latest version to check on whether I made any mistakes or omissions in the modified restoration. I hope you are doing well. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Donner60" title="User:Donner60">Donner60</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Donner60" title="User talk:Donner60">talk</a>) 06:07, 24 June 2018 (UTC)

<p>So I took another break from Wikipedia (the first break was during the time I was blocked) and I decided to try again. In addition, I've begun to improve a bit since my block expired. Last night I made an edit but I felt it was disruptive so I undid it. So yeah there's some slight improvement. Anyways, the reason I removed the subsections from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Airlines_Flight_175" title="United Airlines Flight 175">United Airlines Flight 175</a> is because those subsections were not in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines_Flight_11" title="American Airlines Flight 11">American Airlines Flight 11</a> and it originally did't have those sections, but I initially thought it was good, but I changed my mind. So can I remove the sub-sections (again)? I will not do so until I get an answer, don't worry. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Tigerdude9" title="User:Tigerdude9">Tigerdude9</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Tigerdude9" title="User talk:Tigerdude9">talk</a>) 22:43, 15 November 2018 (UTC).
</p>
<dl><dd>The short answer is no, you should not remove the sub-sections. I believe the same style of sub-sections should be added to American Airlines Flight 11 and will probably be added when I have the time. If you continue to edit war and make alterations without thinking first, then you will face another block. <a href="User%253ADavid_J_Johnson.html" title="User:David J Johnson">David J Johnson</a> (<a href="User_talk%253ADavid_J_Johnson.html#top" title="User talk:David J Johnson">talk</a>) 11:45, 16 November 2018 (UTC)
<dl><dd>Ok, I will not remove the sub-sections. If you want, I could add the sub-sections to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Airlines_Flight_11" title="American Airlines Flight 11">American Airlines Flight 11</a> myself, but I'll wait to hear from you first. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Tigerdude9" title="User:Tigerdude9">Tigerdude9</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Tigerdude9" title="User talk:Tigerdude9">talk</a>) 20:24, 23 November 2018 (UTC)

She looked at the three tall firemen in their shining helmets, standing among the smoke and cinders and dissolving snowballs, and she said, "Would you like anything to read?"</p></blockquote> My thanks to you for your efforts to keep the 'pedia readable in case the firemen chose one of our articles&#160;:-) Best wishes to you and yours and happy editing in 2019. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:MarnetteD" title="User:MarnetteD">MarnetteD</a>&#124;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:MarnetteD" title="User talk:MarnetteD">Talk</a> 18:49, 18 December 2018 (UTC)

<p>Hi David, Thanks for your message. As you suggested, I've had a closer look at the sourcing for the progressive collapse section and I think I've found the problem. While the section begins with a reference to Bazant and Verdure (2007) it goes on to describe the collapses based on the 2002 FEMA report. That earlier report did, indeed, suggest "floor failures", but after the NIST report (which Bazant and Verdure also cite) the floor-failure mechanism suggested by FEMA has been generally abandoned. (For this reason, I don't think FEMA should be cited in this part of the article at all.) As Bazant and Verdure explain, the correct way to describe the total destruction of the towers is by reference to the "propagation of [a] crushing front" in which the column sections (about one storey's worth) immediately under the falling upper block (which should be "treated as rigid") fail, allowing for free fall through the height of another storey of the building. This goes on through a "crush-down" phase (which destroys the building below) and then a "crush-up" phase (which destroys the falling block after it reaches the ground). All of this can be straightforwardly sourced to Bazant and Verdure (2007). It occurred to me that one reason for the confusion might be the ambiguity of the word "floor" which can also mean "storey". Even on Bazant and Verdure's account, it could be argued that the "floors" (i.e., storeys) failed progressively, one at a time. But it should be made clear that they were <i>crushed</i> and that the floor spans did not break off the columns and "punch" through and crash (through the ceiling, as it were) onto the floors below as the FEMA report proposed. In its current form the article clearly uses "floor failure" in FEMA's sense, which, like I say, is wrong. I don't get the impression that you're interested in discussing this, and I'm not interested in fighting with you over the article, so I'm just passing this information on to you to do with as you will. Feel free to use anything I've said here in the article if you find it useful. Best, --<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Thomas_Basboll" title="User:Thomas Basboll">Thomas B</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Thomas_Basboll" title="User talk:Thomas Basboll">talk</a>) 09:41, 19 January 2019 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>I had some spare time and went ahead and rewrote the section. It might be improved further, but it's now much closer to the received view on the collapses than it was.

<dd>Thomas...I think you and I have worked better in recent months than ever before but I still think you're a bit trapped in the mode of something other than the engineering record happened on 9/11. The arguments about the 707, speed and fuel are pretty thin...and oddly yours do somewhat parallel those found 911 truther pages.

<p>Hi Mr.Johnson,
</p><p>This is in reference to this article.
The title of the section 'Religious Apologetics' is seemingly inconsistent with the rest of the article. Why in the previous sections were the stated theories such as 'Multiverse' and 'Alien design' not headlined with similar -implicitly- undermining titles like 'Alien Design Claim' or 'Multiverse illusion'? The title is unnecessarily provoking for people with faith. Therefore, I suggest changing the title to something like 'Religious View/Perspective' or reverting the changes.
</p><p>Thank you <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:JackNickol&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:JackNickol (page does not exist)">JackNickol</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:JackNickol" title="User talk:JackNickol">talk</a>) 22:17, 3 May 2020 (UTC)Jack
</p>
<dl><dd>I suggest that you read the latest comments on the article Talk page, which I completely agree with. Your "contribution" should have been there are certainly not on my Talk page.  You also appear to be edit warring on this subject, that will lead to your account being blocked if you carry on.

<p>Hi David, I was hoping you could help me with a question of accuracy. I noted you had rolled back edits by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Mr_167&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Mr 167 (page does not exist)">User: Mr 167</a> where he had changed the dates that construction started.  His edits seem to me to be in line with the body text of the article.  I am no expert in construction or buildings topics, so can you explain why the date construction started should be different to the date in the article?  I have asked the same question on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Willis_Tower" title="Talk:Willis Tower">Talk:Willis Tower</a> in case anyone else can explain it.
</p><p>Many thanks! <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Xevious" title="User:Xevious">Tim (Xevious)</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Xevious" title="User talk:Xevious">talk</a>) 09:24, 19 May 2020 (UTC)
</p>
<dl><dd>Frankly, I'm as confused as you appear to be. I made the rollback simply because <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Mr_167&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Mr 167 (page does not exist)">User: Mr 167</a> was making a host of unsourced changes and had been previously warned by an admin, as well as myself. I think we should wait until an expert in these matters contributes on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Willis_Tower" title="Talk:Willis Tower">Talk:Willis Tower</a> page.
