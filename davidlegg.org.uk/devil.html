<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Thought Injection is what
I have chosen to call the idea that the Devil places evil thoughts
into people's minds. Many Christians speak in a similar way to the
way in which C.H. Spurgeon spoke when a man came up to him and
exclaimed that Spurgeon had just preached a very fine sermon. Mr
Spurgeon replied that the one who had been the first to congratulate
him was the Devil! The implication here was that the Devil was trying
make Spurgeon conceited by planting thoughts in his mind that would
tend to make him sinfully proud of being a great preacher.</FONT></FONT></P>

that the evil thought came not from within himself but directly from
the Devil. Was Spurgeon the only man to believe in Thought Injection?
Certainly not; theologians from the popular like John Bunyan to the

people have believed in Thought Injection. But is Thought Injection a
biblical concept, or did it become popular more recently?</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>In his first letter, John
says a lot about the Devil, and in 1 John 5:19 he says that the whole
Non&nbsp;christian human world is under the control of the Devil.
Since humans control both themselves and others by making decisions
using their minds, and since instances of the Devil appearing to
people and speaking to them seem to be rare, it would appear
reasonable to suspect that the Devil controls people through their
minds using the mechanism of Thought Injection. But what does the
Bible have to say?</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>In the case of
Non&nbsp;christians, we can turn to at least a few examples of
Thought Injection. A striking example (in more ways than one) is when
God sent an evil spirit upon King Saul causing him to throw a spear
at his rival: &quot;I'll pin David to the Wall!&quot;</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>This example is striking
in a further way, because it shows us that there are many different
degrees of demonic influence. The spirit came `forcefully' upon King
Saul (1 Samuel 18:10). The spirit might have influenced him gently on
many occasions, but this time he came violently. The most forceful
and violent examples of evil spirits exercising control over people
are perhaps the ones in the Gospels. The Bible describes people such
as Legion as demon possessed.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Judas Iscariot provides
us with an example of how at first the Devil controlled a man gently,
he `prompted' Judas to betray the Lord (John 13:2). Later, Satan took
full possession of Judas by `entering' him (John 13:27).</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>It is clear that neither
Judas nor Saul were born again. Equally clear is the fact that true
Christians cannot be possessed by the Devil or another evil spirit.
This is because Christians have been rescued from the Devil's power
(Acts 10:38) and the Holy Spirit lives within them (Romans 8:9). This
is in contrast with the house that was swept clean but left
`unoccupied' (Matthew 12:44) and in contrast with the case of King
Saul who, when the Holy Spirit left him, was tormented instead by an
evil spirit (1 Samuel 16:14).</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Given that Christians
cannot be possessed by evil spirits because the Holy Spirit indwells
them, the reason for this must be that the Holy Spirit controls their
minds. Consequently, an evil spirit cannot control a Christian's mind
because it is already under the control of the Holy Spirit. The one
who is in us (the Holy Spirit) is greater than the one who is in the
world (the Devil). If an evil spirit were to take control of a mind
long enough to inject a thought, that is, in a definite enough manner
for the mind actually to think the injected thought, that would
incompatible with Romans 8:9 which says that Christians are
controlled by the Holy Spirit.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Furthermore, there is no
essential difference between Thought Injection and demon possession,
for if the Devil can control your mind for sufficiently long and to
such an extent that he can actually make you think an evil thought
then he could make you think several. If he could make you think
several evil thoughts, he could make you think dozens. If dozens then
hundreds or thousands. How could anyone tell the difference between
such a frightful state and being demon possessed? Thought Injection
is not taxonomically distinct from demon possession, the two are
essentially the same, differing only in degree and extent.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>The Christians to whom
James wrote had a fault. When they had evil desires they looked
around for someone else to blame them on. Only no&nbsp;one had told
them that they could blame their evil thoughts on the Devil, so they
blamed them on God (James 1:13). James, however, was quite clear
about where evil desires originate: they originate from within
ourselves (James 1:14). James does not worry about whether he is
being a bit hard on his brothers, he tells them the truth about the
human heart as it is found in Jeremiah 17: `The heart is deceitful
above all things and beyond cure'. Some modern Christians blame their
evil desires on the Devil, but the correct diagnoses are given by
James and Jeremiah.</FONT></FONT></P>

conflict is not between the Holy Spirit and the Devil, it is between
the Holy Spirit and the sinful nature. That is not to say that the
Devil is not a problem, rather that when we are talking about the
spiritual conflict that arises in our inmost beings, the conflict is
between the Holy Spirit and the heart or the sinful nature, not with
the Devil.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>For those who believe in
Thought Injection, there is a natural tendency to see examples of it
everywhere in Scripture. Take 1 Chronicles 21:1 for instance. The
text says that the Devil `incited' David to count his troops. There
are myriad ways in which the Devil could have got David to sin in
this way, but people who believe in Thought Injection automatically
make the text prove the truth of Thought Injection. If this were
valid, then 2 Samuel 24:1, which describes the same incident, would
prove that actually it was God who injected the evil thought into
David's mind, contrary to James 1:13,14. Perhaps the writer of one
book was drawing our attention to the reality and personal nature of
spiritual warfare, whilst the other was reminding us of God's
sovereignty over even our sins? What is certain is that neither
author chose to describe the exact mechanism by which David was
incited to count his soldiers.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>A similar problem is that
of relying upon the opinion of others or simply upon commentaries to
understand passages of scripture. An example of this is the `fiery
darts' of Ephesians 6. The massive, century spanning, propaganda
machine will instantly make us think of the Devil planting thoughts
in people's minds whenever fiery darts are mentioned. A more
unnatural interpretation of the passage cannot be imagined, but many
will adhere to this understanding simply because it is popular, or it
is the only interpretation that they have ever heard. Instead, we
should be like the noble Bereans of Acts 17 who even checked what the
Apostle Paul said against Scripture. More on Ephesians 6 later.</FONT></FONT></P>

from demonic Thought Injection then, since the Bible is mainly about
Christians, we would expect to be able to read about it. If however

to be the case.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>We now turn to a pair of
examples of how the Devil tried to tempt people: Jesus in the
wilderness, and Eve in the Garden of Eden. Neither of these events is
a typical example of the actual mechanisms by which the Devil deals
with God's people today. Some have thought that they are. No doubt,
we can learn many things from the two accounts (including some truths
about resisting the Devil), but to suggest that they give examples of
how the Devil speaks to us today is to miss their point. The passages
in Genesis 3 and Luke 4 are atypical because the Devil actually
appeared to both Jesus and Eve and spoke audible words to them, even
selecting a suitable body to use in the garden, that of a serpent. It
would seem that this kind of demonic contact is not common today
(although there may be a case for saying that it happens in some
particularly benighted parts of the world). The main thing we learn
from these passages comes through comparing them with each other, and
by contrasting how, on one hand, we (in Adam) fell from our exalted
position in wonderful surroundings, and the Saviour triumphed despite
being very hungry and in desolate surroundings. The first Adam fell,
the second conquered.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Nevertheless, it is
interesting to see how the Devil approached the problem of tempting
Eve. He really wanted to take revenge on God by spoiling his perfect
creation, so he craftily (Genesis 3:1) took the form of a serpent. He
then engaged Eve in conversation and planted doubts in her mind about
God's character. Everything went according to plan and Eve sinned by
doubting and then disobeying God.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>If the Devil had been
able to inject these doubts directly into Eve's mind he could have
saved himself the bother of appearing in the guise of a snake. He
could have suggested evil to her by a far more subtle method than
engaging her in normal audible conversation, he could have dropped
the seeds of sin straight into her mind without Eve even suspecting
who had done it. As it was, he had to do it the hard way. This was
because Eve's mind was protected due her being indwelt by the Holy
Spirit. It seems reasonable to deduce (though perhaps not completely
certain) that Adam and Eve were both indwelt by the Holy Spirit. This
made it possible for them to have fellowship with God. It would
account for them dying spiritually when they fell.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Similarly, Jesus `full of
the Holy Spirit' was driven out into the Desert of Judea to be
tempted (Luke 4:1). The Devil could not influence the Lord in the
same easy way that he could control fallen sinners because Jesus was
filled with Holy Spirit. So, although perhaps unaccustomed to
speaking, the Devil used spoken, audible words: &quot;Since you are
the Son of God ...&quot;. Just as with Adam and Eve, the Devil tried
to get Jesus to rely on his divine power to satisfy his appetite
rather than relying on God &nbsp; as the second Adam had to in order
to be a perfect substitute. He had to be like his brothers in every
way (Hebrews 2:14,17) if he was to be a perfect saviour and destroy
the power of the Devil. Jesus was filled with the Spirit, so Thought
Injection was not even an option for Satan.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Yet another problem with
believing in Thought Injection is that there would be no Biblical way
of preventing it from occurring. Indeed, we could not even identify
those thoughts that had been injected by the Devil. Some would say
that particularly evil desires must have come from the Devil, but
this is inconsistent with his use of craft and subtlety. It is also
at odds with what verses like Jeremiah 17:9 say about the human
heart: `... deceitful ... Who can understand it?' Others, perhaps
acknowledging this objection, have suggested that particularly
irrational thoughts originate with the Devil. But, this suggestion is
also weakened by the deceitfulness of the human heart. Furthermore,
all sin is irrational. Jesus is the only entirely rational man who
has ever lived. The rest of us are confused by tangled layers of
deceit and irrationality, making it impossible for us to analyse our
thoughts reliably. There is much in Scripture to help you with your
sinful heart, but with Thought Injection you are on your own!</FONT></FONT></P>

paralytic in Mark 2 teaches us that it is much easier to talk about a
problem &nbsp; &quot;your sins are forgiven&quot; than it is to do
something about it &nbsp; &quot;take up your mat and walk&quot;.
Similarly it is a lot easier to say &quot;the Devil said to me that
it would be pleasant to do such and such&quot; than it is to deal
with the problem of our own evil desires. To say something about the
Devil is also very easy because it can be a lie and nobody will ever
know. Or will they? It could be that at that very moment, in heaven,
Satan is accusing us to God saying &quot;How can you call me the
Father of Lies when your servant who claims to be a Christian has
just told a lie about me?&quot; And yet it seems that some blame the
Devil for every wrong thought they have, for every time they feel
sleepy whilst praying, for every time they lose their temper. It
sounds Really Spiritual too. Meanwhile, another group of Christians

because often a direct attack is impossible. If the weapon of Thought
Injection were available, Satan would not need to concoct schemes.

<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Some of Satan's schemes
fall into the category of attacks upon our character or upon our
reputation as God's holy people, that is, attacks upon God's work and
upon the Gospel. This seems to be the situation that Paul is
concerned about in 2 Corinthians 2:5&nbsp;11. The original problem in
the church at Corinth had been dealt with by the application of
church discipline. But now there was a new risk. The church member
who had sinned had repented, so there was an urgent need for him to
be received back into fellowship otherwise, Satan might outwit God's
people (v11). If the church did not forgive the repentant sinner, the
Devil could immediately do at least two devious things. He could go
to the Non&nbsp;christians who used to say things like &quot;see how
these Christians love each other&quot; and point out to them &quot;how
much these Christians hate each other! The Gospel they preach is a
form of religion, but without any power to prevent sin.&quot; He
could then bring further dishonour by accusing the Corinthian
Christians to God himself day and night (Revelation 12:10). This kind
of attack could do irreparable damage to the work of the church and
rob God of his glory, so Paul urges the Corinthians to remember
Satan's schemes and not to be trapped by them.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>In 1 Peter 5:8,9, Peter
warns his readers about certain kinds of suffering that were common
to believers throughout the world (v9). The previous chapter (v12&nbsp;16)
makes it clear that the sorts of suffering described in chapter 5:8,9
were persecution from Non&nbsp;christians, insults, ill treatment for
being Christians and other unspecified `painful trials'. But, Peter
is not content simply to remind the Christians to be careful how they
react when people treat them badly, he paints a vivid picture of the
Devil being like a lion who picks on individual Christians and eats
them. It would not be long before Christians would be fed to the
lions in Rome (if it had not started happening already), so Peter
attempts to lift his readers' eyes from their persecutors to the
spiritual battle that was going on all around them. In this way, he
was helping them not to resent their human enemies, but to love them

<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>In Ephesians 6:11 Paul,
having reminded his readers not to be taken in by the Devil's
schemes, attempts to do the same as Peter did in his letter: he tells
them that their real enemy is not their human opponents but the
spiritual forces of evil, namely the Devil and his angels. The reason
that they were in danger of thinking that their real enemies were
made of flesh and blood was that they were being persecuted by
humans. Presumably, their actual persecutors were `rulers and
authorities', so Paul lists all kinds of evil spiritual rulers and
authorities. By paralleling their possible misconception in this way,
he enables them to understand the spiritual battle in which they were
taking part. He helps them to focus on their real enemies, evil
spirits, the Devil and all his schemes that were being cleverly
worked out through Non&nbsp;christian persecutors. And he does this
so that the Christians can resist the Devil rather than simply
resisting their persecutors.</FONT></FONT></P>

impossible to understand the `flaming arrows' in verse 16 as anything
except acts of persecution or cruelty to Christians. To suggest, as
some have done, that the flaming arrows are an example of Thought
Injection is pure fiction, having no foundation in Scripture. How are
we to understand this metaphor? One way is to see that Paul in
Ephesians 6:10&nbsp;18 has similar intentions to those that Peter had
when writing 1 Peter 5:8,9. The simile of the lion teaches us about
the Devil attacking individual Christians in an uncompromising way;
it is a short, vivid pen picture. The metaphor of the flaming arrows
teaches an analogous lesson using the language of archery; the Devil
is like an archer who deliberately lights a flaming arrow, locates a
suitable Christian, mercilessly takes aim and fires an arrow of
persecution directly into the life of that carefully selected
Christian. The evil deed, however, is usually carried out by a human
agent.</FONT></FONT></P>

although Satan's attacks are carefully aimed and even violent, they
come to us via schemes, in a slightly indirect way. This is further
demonstrated to us by the startling account of Peter's denial of the
Lord. In Luke 22:31, Jesus tells his disciples that Satan had
requested that he be allowed to &quot;sift&quot; them &quot;as
wheat&quot;. Jesus said that he prayed for Peter in particular, that
his faith would not fail. If there is such a thing as Thought
Injection, then even if we could find no evidence for it anywhere
else in the Bible, we would expect to find it demonstrated beyond a
shadow of doubt in the remainder of chapter 22 of Luke's gospel.</FONT></FONT></P>

boldness, they all ran away. All, that is, except Peter, because
Jesus had prayed for him that his &quot;faith may not fail&quot;. How

astonishingly brave Peter is staying as close to his master as he
dares. He too is frightened, having followed the crowd to the high
priest's house, into the lion's den (1 Peter 5:8 springs to mind). At
this point, Peter is at his most vulnerable, and Satan decides to
sift Peter systematically. First, he inspires an anonymous woman to
expose Peter. Secondly, he gets someone completely different to
identify him with Jesus. Satan then leaves Peter a full hour to stew,
worrying about himself more than about Jesus, having completely
forgotten Jesus' prediction, very scared. When the third and final
test comes in the form of a direct accusation, there is no need to
speculate about Thought Injection in order to explain why Peter
sinned: he was petrified!</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>This kind of approach is
similar to the scheme which Satan used on Job. Satan was allowed
closer to Job than any other Christian we are told about in the
Bible; Satan was even allowed to afflict Job's body. And yet, when
the Devil tries to get Job to deny the Lord, he does it through his
wife. There is no suggestion of Job having thoughts injected into his
mind by the Devil, it is through his wife that the evil idea comes:
&quot;Curse God and die!&quot; As Job's trials deepen, the Devil
sends him three comforters who say a mixture of good and bad, but are
generally a sore trial to him. During his trials, Job is ignorant of
the Devil&quot;s schemes, but even he says that his comforters are
evil men, that he has been made a `target' and that he is surrounded
by `archers' (Job 16:12,13. Ephesians 6:16 springs to mind). The
Bible gives us no reason to think that Thought Injection into the
minds of Christians is one of the Devil's schemes. On the contrary,
the biblical accounts of the trials of Christians supply other
mechanisms by which the Devil sifts people. It is unnecessary to turn
away from the biblical explanations to ideas invented by men.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Surprisingly, an incident
which immediately speaks of Thought Injection to those in favour of
it provides us with a striking example of Satan's `worldliness'
scheme. When Jesus explained how he was going to die (Matthew
16:21,22), Peter rebuked him! This seems ridiculous with the benefit
of hindsight, but it would appear from verses 25 to 28 that Peter's
mind was focused upon a wonderful vision of Jesus the King leading a
rebellion against the Romans and establishing his eternal righteous
kingdom on earth. To Peter's shock, Jesus tells both Peter and us
something that we would not have understood if Jesus had not
explained it to us. When Jesus said to Peter &quot;Get behind me
Satan&quot;, he attributed Peter's sinful worldly attitude concerning
Jesus' kingdom unambiguously to Satan.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>Although Jesus tells us
that Satan was intimately involved with Peter's sin, we know that
nothing like Thought Injection occurred because of the explanation
that Jesus gives in verse 23 itself. Notice that Jesus does not say
that Peter had `in mind the things of Satan', he says that Peter had
&quot;in mind ... the things of men&quot;. How can this be when Jesus
has just called Peter &quot;Satan&quot;? The answer is simple: Jesus
was explaining how Peter's worldly attitude had been absorbed
throughout his life by mixing with and listening to the ideas of men
who themselves were the children of the Devil. By using this scheme,
the Devil had set up many chains of worldly influence, all aimed
directly at Jesus in an attempt to prevent him from dying and saving
his people. In this incident, it was not mainly Peter who was under
attack. Peter was a Christian whom the Devil just happened to use as
the last link in a complex set of chains which were designed to tempt
Jesus to become a worldly king instead of dying and thus becoming a
spiritual saviour and king. This temptation was, in fact, the
continuation of where the Devil left off after the high mountain,
when he showed Jesus all the kingdoms of the earth, saying &quot;if
you worship me (the Devil), it will all be yours&quot;! That also
explains why Jesus was in no way exaggerating when he said &quot;Get
behind me Satan&quot; to his poor, worldly, confused disciple.</FONT></FONT></P>

<FONT FACE="Arial, sans-serif"><FONT SIZE=4>An interesting corollary
of the above incident where Peter is called &quot;Satan&quot; is that
it must be possible for demonic temptation to come to us through
other Christians. Peter was unknowingly participating in one of
Satan's subtle schemes, therefore an important part of resisting the
Devil for all Christians is to make sure that we do not assist the
Devil by unwittingly tempting other Christians. Matthew 16 teaches us
that when we propagate our worldly attitudes amongst Christians, we
are doing the Devil's work for him. Let us beware lest &quot;Satan
... outwit us&quot; (2 Corinthians 2:11).</FONT></FONT></P>

worldly, attitude. Such weaknesses are not unheard of amongst God's
people! How could Satan capitalise on such weaknesses? It is possible
to imagine that, say, one of David's courtiers whispered in his ear
that the kings of the Philistines had so many hundred thousand
soldiers, so many hundred chariots of iron etc, and might not David
be losing the psychological battle? Might his troops be getting

creep up on us and have us sinning before we have even thought about
what we doing. In this way, the Devil can `invest' in our futures
before we have even left his kingdom. It is a way by which the Devil
can infiltrate God's kingdom through people who have become
