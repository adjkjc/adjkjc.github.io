        <h1>Saturn&#146;s Golden Age</h1>
      </center>
      <p align="justify"> The age that man later called the Age of Kronos (Saturn) 
        was remembered with nostalgia as an age of bliss. References to the Age 
        of Kronos in the ancient lore are very numerous.<a name="s_1"></a><sup><a href="goldage.htm#f_1">(1)</a></sup> 
      <p align="justify"> Hesiod tells of 
      <p align="justify">
      <blockquote>
        <p align="justify"> A golden race of mortal men who lived in the time 
          of Kronos when he was reigning in heaven. And they lived like gods without 
          sorrow of heart, remote and free from toil: miserable age rested not 
          on them . . . The fruitful earth unforced bare them fruit abundantly 
          and without stint. They dwelt in ease and peace upon their lands with 
          many good things. . . .<a name="s_2"></a><sup><a href="goldage.htm#f_2">(2)</a></sup> 
      </blockquote>
      <p align="justify"> Similarly writes Ovid in the sixth book of his <i>Metamorphoses:</i> 
      <p align="justify">
      <blockquote>
        <p align="justify"> In the beginning was the Golden Age, when men of their 
          own accord, without threat of punishment, without laws, maintained good 
          faith and did what was right. . . . The earth itself, without compulsion, 
          untouched by the hoe, unfurrowed by any share, produced all things spontaneously. 
          . . . It was a season of everlasting spring.<a name="s_3"></a><sup><a href="goldage.htm#f_3">(3)</a></sup> 
      </blockquote>
      <p align="justify"> Rabbinical sources recount that men lived under very 
        favorable conditions before the Deluge, and that these contributed to 
        their sinfulness: &#147;They knew neither toil nor care and as a consequence 
        of their extraordinary prosperity they grew insolent.&#148; <sup><a href="goldage.htm#f_4">(4)</a></sup> 
      <p align="justify"> The dominance of Saturn at some remote period in the 
        history of the life of the peoples on Earth was of such pronounced and 
        all-pervading character that the question arises whether the adventures 
        of the planet going through many exploits could by itself be the full 
        cause of the worship of the planet and the naming of the Golden Age &#147;the 
        Age of Kronos&#148; (Saturn). Saturn exploded and caused the Earth to 
        go through the greatest of its historical catastrophes, and this was completely 
        sufficient to make of Saturn the supreme deity; but it appears that the 
        Age of Saturn is a name for the epoch <i>before</i> the Deluge; after 
        the Deluge Saturn, dismembered, almost ceased to exist as a planetary 
        body and when at length it was reconstituted it was fettered by rings, 
        and was far from being the dominant celestial body that would behoove 
        it as the supreme deity of the epoch. The &#147;Age of Kronos&#148; is 
        so glorious an age that it is hardly thinkable to connect it with the 
        period after the Deluge. The wailing for Adonis, Tammuz of the Babylonians, 
        or Osiris of the Egyptians, deplored the end of its dominance, not the 
        beginning of it. 
      <p align="justify"> Then why was Saturn the supreme deity by whose name 
        the great and glorious age <i>before</i> the Deluge was named? Because 
        it removed Uranus from its role of chief deity, and to the onlookers on 
        Earth, emasculated him? If the distances between the Earth and Saturn 
        and Uranus were then what they are now, then such occurrences could scarcely 
        be observable: Uranus is only faintly visible in the night sky over Mesopotamia 
        in a most translucent night. Saturn is clearly visible but is not, for 
        an unaided eye, a spectacle in the sky; it was more voluminous and more 
        luminous before the Deluge, but if it moved on an orbit not too different 
        from the present one, and the Earth were moving approximately in the same 
        quarters where it moves today, then the surprise still persists as to 
        how a body on a 30-years-long orbit could make the inhabitants of the 
        Earth on its one-year-long orbit, regard it the supreme of all celestial 
        bodies in the sky. 
      <p align="justify"> The appellative &#147;sun&#148; employed for Saturn 
        could be explained by its unusual brightness when it exploded as a nova 
        for a short time, actually for seven days, before the beginning of the 
        Deluge on Earth. Assuming the length of the day in those times to have 
        been not too dissimilar from its present value, the velocity of the moving 
        masses being on the order of 100 kilometers a second or 8,600,000 kilometers 
        in a 24-hour period, and the Earth and Saturn being on the closest points 
        on their reciprocal orbits, or in conjuction (which is another surmise), 
        in seven days a distance of ca. 60 million kilometers would be covered. 
        On present orbits the distance between Saturn and Earth varies from 1,279 
        million kilometers at superior conjunction to 1,578 million kilometers 
        at opposition; the lesser of these distances is ca. 21 times greater than 
        that above calculated. This means also that unless the velocity of the 
        ejected water was an order of magnitude greater than 100 km per second, 
        the distance between Saturn and Earth must have been substantially smaller 
        than it is at present. 
      <p align="justify"> I have rather arbitrarily selected the figure of 100 
        kilometers a second for the motion of the exploded material; today the 
        escape velocity, or the speed required for a projectile on the surface 
        of Saturn to leave the gravitational attraction of the planet is but 35 
        kilometers a second. For Jupiter the escape velocity is 59 kilometers 
        a second. Assuming that Saturn was of a mass equal to that of Jupiter, 
        the same figure would apply to it too. With 100 kilometers a second we 
        have almost double the velocity of escape. The arbitrariness of the assumption 
        of such velocity for our calculations is obvious. But if the set of figures 
        is not too far from what they actually were, the conclusion would be that 
        the distance of the Earth from Saturn was but a twentieth part of what 
        it is now; this would permit us to speculate whether the Earth could at 
        some early period have been a satellite of Saturn. The distance 60 million 
        km is commensurate with the distance of Mercury from the Sun, or 58 million 
        km; Jupiter&#146;s satellites revolve at distances up to 24 million km 
        from the primary. Theoretically Saturn could have satellites as large 
        as the Earth: the Moon is only one-fortieth of the Earth in volume, whereas 
        Saturn is 760 times larger than our planet.<a name="s_5"></a><sup><a href="goldage.htm#f_5">(5)</a></sup> 
      <p align="justify"> If such was ever the case, the &#147;Age of Saturn&#148; 
        and the very unusual conditions under which mankind lived in it, and Saturn&#146;s 
        worship prior to the Deluge, would gain in meaning. The appellative &#147;sun&#148; 
        used for Saturn would be understood as resulting not only from the great 
        light it emitted for a short period when a nova, but also from its long-standing 
        role of a primary for the revolving Earth. 
      <p align="justify"> If there is truth in the surmise, and nothing more it 
        is than a surmise, that the Earth was once a satellite of Saturn, the 
        latter must have revolved closer to the sun in order that the Earth should 
        receive heat from it&#151;Saturn exudes little heat<a name="s_6"></a><sup><a href="goldage.htm#f_6">(6)</a></sup>&#151;and 
        if the age of Kronos was a golden age, then it is also proper to assume 
        that the conditions on the satellite Earth were not unfavorable for life. 
        The geological record documents extreme climates for the past of the Earth&#151;times 
        when corals grew in the Arctic, and times when the Earth, partly even 
        on the equator, was fettered by ice. Such climates require definitely 
        abnormal conditions that could be created only by varying positions of 
        our planet as an astronomical body. Therefore surmises as made in this 
        section are not in conflict with geological and paleo-climatological records&#151;yet 
        it is not what could have taken place, but what took place, or the historical 
        record, that is the proper goal for inquest. In the absence of direct 
        indications we may only deal with the problem of the Earth as a satellite 
        of Saturn as with a hypothetical construction, requiring further elucidation. 
      <p align="justify"> It is assumed by modern astronomy that the ninth planet, 
        Pluto, was once a satellite of Neptune, which, having collided with Triton, 
        another satellite of the planet, was thrown out of the ring and became 
        an independent planet; the satellite Triton, however, as a consequence 
        of the collision, reversed the direction of its revolution and became 
        a retrograde satellite.<a name="s_7"></a><sup><a href="goldage.htm#f_7">(7)</a></sup> 
        Another instance of a postulated conversion of a planetary satellite into 
        an independent planet is discussed by Van Flandern and Harrington in their 
        paper &#147;A Dynamical Investigation of the Conjecture that Mercury is 
        an Escaped Satellite of Venus,&#148; <i>Icarus </i>28 (1976), pp. 435-440.]. 
        Thus the principle of a conversion of a satellite into a planet in its 
        own right is not a phenomenon that is discussed here for the first time. 
      <p align="justify"> The Golden Age of Saturn or Kronos came to its end with 
        the supreme god of that period, the planet Saturn, was broken up. The 
        Age of Kronos was not the earliest age of which man retained some, however 
        dim, memories&#151;but farther into the past the dimness amounts almost 
        to darkness.<a name="s_8"></a><sup><a href="goldage.htm#f_8">(8)</a></sup>
