				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In 2020, thousands of companies applied to be recognized as one of the best workplaces in America. Assessing criteria such as career development, benefits, senior leadership, and trust, employees’ answers to anonymous questionnaires are analyzed to identify the top scoring organizations. Just 389 have been recognized as Inc.’s 2020 Best Workplaces, and Imgur is honored to have earned a spot among them. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Seatbelts, everyone!</p>
<p>Despite the ongoing (at the time of writing) COVID-19 lockdown, Imgurians have been striking out on a virtual field trip of the universe, sharing their past travels and experiences with the Imgur Community for the whole week of April 27 to May 3. </p>
<p>With over 3,100 submissions to the Field Trip tag, it has become a veritable cornucopia of interesting places, from arid deserts to abandoned theme parks to monster truck rallies.</p>
<p>Join us as we take a look at a few of our favorites! Or if you’d like to check them all out for yourself, <a href="https://imgur.com/t/field_trip">take a look at the tag.</a></p>
<blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="a/ZJlHJ6Q"><p><a href="//imgur.com/a/ZJlHJ6Q">Abandoned six flags</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Silently rusting on the outskirts of New Orleans, Louisiana and sprawling 140-acres is the once-bustling Six Flags New Orleans theme park. Initially closed temporarily due to Hurricane Katrina back in 2005, the park suffered severe salt-water flooding and remained submerged for many months, sadly resulting in its abandonment and, ultimately, sometime in the near future &#8211; its demolition. </p>
<p>Imgurian <a href="https://imgur.com/user/nawwwwson">@nawwwwson</a> took us on a tour of the eerie park, complete with rides, creepy graffiti, and empty streets.</p>
<blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="a/SwzL3Nv"><p><a href="//imgur.com/a/SwzL3Nv">Great Lakes Science and Sailing</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>If you grew up in North America you’re no doubt very familiar with the Great Lakes, vast bodies of water spanning between the United States and Canada that are best compared with inland oceans. For centuries these freshwater behemoths have been a backbone of trade, with thousands of ships of all sizes plying the coasts, locks, levies, and ports of the five lakes.</p>
<p>Imgurian <a href="https://imgur.com/user/readingrabbit">readingrabbit</a> took us aboard an 850ft three-Masted Cargo Schooner from the 1850s on an adventure and explains the intricacies of each lake, the trade plied on them, and even explores a few shipwrecks on the way. </p>
<blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="a/51oQuTb"><p><a href="//imgur.com/a/51oQuTb">City Museum, St. Louis, MO — The Most Proudly Unsafe Museum EVER</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>No field trip is complete without a stop at a museum, which is exactly where <a href="https://imgur.com/user/StepRightUp">@StepRightUp</a> took us. Welcome to the City Museum, in St. Louis, Missouri, a unique half-museum-half-art-exhibit that resides in the heart of downtown STL. </p>
<p>From crawling through caves to climbing out on the wing of an aircraft, this unique post offered a fantastic glimpse at the ever-evolving museum through the eyes of an Imgurian. </p>
<blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="a/PMmMlDe"><p><a href="//imgur.com/a/PMmMlDe">Let&#39;s go on a field trip to Monster Jam! Because I&#39;m a grown woman who still enjoys monster trucks. </a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>This Sunday! Sunday! Sunday! </p>
<p>In a post that’s sure to tickle any motor-head, our very own <a href="https://imgur.com/user/sarah">@sarah</a> took us on a trip to a monster-truck rally in Oakland, California. Walking us through the intricacies and nuances of monster-trucking, audience votes, and sick truck flips. </p>
<p>One thing is for certain, with this post you pay for the full seat, but you’ll only need the edge!</p>
<blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="a/zjdYj4f"><p><a href="//imgur.com/a/zjdYj4f">Antarctica &#8211; Bucket list ✓</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Few places are more remote, desolate, and inhospitable as the Antarctic. Setting off from South America, Imgurian <a href="https://imgur.com/user/xEmpressDee">@xEmpressDee</a> took us along on her family’s bucket list expedition. Featuring penguins, seasickness, and adorable seals, this incredible post took us to a place few of us will ever get the chance to venture. </p>
<p>We hope you enjoyed going on the first-ever Imgur Field Trip as much as we did! Don’t forget to <a href="https://imgur.com/t/field_trip">check out the tag</a> if you’d like to see more, and thanks to all the Imgurians who submitted their wonderful adventures. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">By Catherine Chang (Senior Integrated Marketing Manager), Michael Peroutka (VP of Brand Partnerships) &amp; Jimmy Marsanico (Head of Data) </span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As COVID-19 continues to keep people away from family and friends, at least physically, </span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/disney-plus-hulu-getting-biggest-subscriber-gains-surveys-2020-4?utm_source=Internet+Brunch&amp;utm_campaign=8f2be3ec62-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_09_12_01_00_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_fb5e40aa73-8f2be3ec62-490893405&amp;mc_cid=8f2be3ec62&amp;mc_eid=414cdfb275"><span style="font-weight: 400;">entertainment </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">and </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21193094/facebook-coronavirus-covid-19-messaging-service-reliable-strain-outages"><span style="font-weight: 400;">social platforms</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> across the board have been bombarded with an unprecedented surge in usage. Over here at </span><a href="https://imgur.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Imgur</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we’ve seen over double digit growth in traffic over the past week compared to our 12 week running average.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are now at over 300 million monthly unique visitors and 2.8 billion page views globally. We believe that these increases are due to a variety of factors, including:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Imgur&#8217;s Positive Tone</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; As Imgur&#8217;s mission is to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">lift the world&#8217;s spirits for a few moments a day,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> we&#8217;ve seen a strong uptick in traffic over the past week as people are looking for moments of bite-sized entertainment that puts a smile on their face (like </span><a href="https://imgur.com/t/staff_picks/fl8319T"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) to combat everything they are seeing in the news and on other social platforms. As we’ve proven out through</span><a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/59b44ed8ccc5c5736a2f490d/t/5ae9fd88758d46215b6370f6/1525284233616/Imgur_Net_Positive_Infographic.pdf"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">research with YPulse</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Imgur is one of the few platforms that drives happiness amongst the majority of its users.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>People Working From Home</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> &#8211; With commute times and the fear of co-workers catching you browning the internet eliminated, more people are visiting Imgur between the hours of 8 AM &#8211; 6 PM than ever before!  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Cancellation of Sporting Events</b> <b>&#8211; </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">With 73% of our audience falling within the A18-44 demographic, we compete with the likes of ESPN, Bleacher Report, etc. for attention. As those platforms don&#8217;t have much to report on, consumers are turning their attention elsewhere.  </span></li>
</ol>
<p><b>Millennials and Gen Z Favor Digital Campfires Over Traditional Social Media as the Pandemic Disrupts Normal Life</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What we find even more interesting is that the pandemic has proven that the shift from traditional social media platforms to “</span><a href="https://hbr.org/2020/02/the-era-of-antisocial-social-media"><span style="font-weight: 400;">digital campfires</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” is no longer an emerging trend. It has arrived. As millennials and Gen Z continue to</span><a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/cz/en/pages/press/articles/cze-tz-nejistota-milenialu-a-generace-z-je-na-rekordnim-maximu.html"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">reshape their relationship with social media</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, they are craving more authentic experiences instead of carefully curated online personas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can pinpoint one of the reasons behind this shift to </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/gregpetro/2019/11/23/influencer-fatigue-paid-influencers-are-out-and-brand-communities-are-in/#a95c07246510"><span style="font-weight: 400;">influencer fatigue</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. After years of being bombarded by perfectly manicured imagery and messaging, younger consumers are savvier than ever and can easily see when an influencer is behaving in a way that feels disingenuous. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They’ve also increasingly turned to online communities that can provide them with a refuge from coworkers and the prying eyes of online “friends” they’ve accumulated over time, family included. These communities, also known as digital campfires, are more intimate online gatherings based on shared interests, allowing people to connect with like-minded people without the scrutiny or judgement that often comes with traditional social media platforms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital campfires can be private messaging, micro-communities, shared experiences or a combination of all three, as illustrated in the examples below.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Facebook </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">is seeing an extreme spike in usage across the globe because of the pandemic, but interestingly, most usage is concentrated in private messaging and video calling. They have seen messaging </span><a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/03/keeping-our-apps-stable-during-covid-19/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">increase over 50% and time in group calling increase by over 1,000%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> during the last month.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Discord,</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a 1-on-1 and group text and voice messaging app popular with teens and the video gaming community, has gone mainstream on a whole new level. In fact, demand has been so explosive that the app crashed several times in the past week. Discord responded by </span><a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/3/21/21185750/how-to-group-chat-watch-movies-games-netflix-discord-zoom-coronavirus-internet"><span style="font-weight: 400;">increasing its overall server capacity and temporarily increasing the cap on the number of people who can join a live screen-sharing channel from 10 to 50. </span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Imgur</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has seen double digit growth in post views in the past week. Now more than ever, people are looking to escape the relentless news cycle while searching for new ways to entertain themselves. At Imgur, they can find digital campfires that can help them learn something, feel inspired, or simply laugh a little as their attention turns inward and indoors. </span></li>
</ul>
<p><b>What Are the Most Active Digital Campfires on Imgur Right Now?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Isolation doesn’t need to be isolating when you can participate in a community that shares the same interests as you. The birth of </span><a href="https://imgur.com/t/distancing_together"><b>#DistancingTogether</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on Imgur supports our belief that the human desire to connect with others, away from influencers and the throngs of “friends” on traditional social media, has only grown stronger during this time.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://blog.imgur.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/covid_graph_take_2__1_.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12892" src="http://blog.imgur.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/covid_graph_take_2__1_.png" alt="covid_graph_take_2__1_" width="960" height="405" /></a></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Popular Digital Campfires on Imgur in the Past 2 Weeks</span></em></p>
<p><b>Streaming</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being stuck at home combined with the demise of linear sports TV viewing for the season has turned people to alternative sources of entertainment such as Imgur, where a wealth of digital campfires have popped up, covering topics as broad as sharing </span><a href="https://imgur.com/t/work_from_home"><b>#WorkFromHome</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> setups to</span> <a href="https://imgur.com/t/tigerking"><b>#TigerKing</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> memes that might only be funny to those who are in the know.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">TV analytics company </span><a href="https://www.edo.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">EDO</span></a> <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/disney-plus-hulu-getting-biggest-subscriber-gains-surveys-2020-4?utm_source=Internet+Brunch&amp;utm_campaign=8f2be3ec62-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2019_09_12_01_00_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_fb5e40aa73-8f2be3ec62-490893405&amp;mc_cid=8f2be3ec62&amp;mc_eid=414cdfb275"><span style="font-weight: 400;">surveyed 6,809 people in the US from March 24 to March 28 about their viewing habits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. 85% of those who responded said that their at-home TV and movie watching has increased recently. The clear winners according to the survey were Disney plus, followed by Hulu and then Netflix.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://blog.imgur.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/covid_chart_3.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12893" src="http://blog.imgur.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/covid_chart_3.png" alt="covid_chart_3" width="959" height="348" /></a></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Percent of EDO Survey Respondents Who Subscribed To New Streaming Services While Social Distancing</span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With jokes abound </span><a href="https://imgur.com/t/netflix/GYFS8bh"><span style="font-weight: 400;">about what the heck to watch next</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, Imgur users are helping each other out by providing suggestions in </span><a href="https://imgur.com/t/movies_to_watch"><b>#MoviesToWatch</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><b>Gaming</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Americans are gaming a lot more as it </span><a href="https://www.verizon.com/about/news/how-americans-are-spending-their-time-temporary-new-normal"><span style="font-weight: 400;">provides a new normal of fun and fellowship.</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Verizon reported that U.S. video game usage during peak hours</span><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/gaming-usage-up-75-percent-coronavirus-outbreak-verizon-reports-1285140"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has gone up 75%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> since the quarantine first went into effect. This means that people are not only sharing their work from home setups, they are also showing off their gaming rigs (</span><a href="https://imgur.com/t/isolation_station"><b>#IsolationStation</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are seeing a resurgence of </span><a href="https://imgur.com/t/animal_crossing"><b>#AnimalCrossing</b></a> <span style="font-weight: 400;">conversations as the latest addition to the beloved gaming franchise </span><a href="https://www.salon.com/2020/03/30/animal-crossing-new-horizons-control-nintendo-switch/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">smashed sales records</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> after launching on March 20th. The game’s appeal is apparent during a time when the real world can seem unpredictable and anxiety-ridden as it transports players to an idyllic island while providing structure and a sense of purpose through daily tasks like fishing and gardening.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The new </span><a href="https://imgur.com/t/doom"><b>#Doom</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> game, which launched on the same day as Animal Crossing, also benefited from the massive uptick in gaming.</span></p>
<p><b>DIY</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re also seeing people taking this time away from other people as an opportunity to learn a new skill or take a deeper dive into their hobbies, whether that’s cooking (</span><a href="https://imgur.com/t/savory_solitude"><b>#SavorySolitude</b></a> <a href="https://imgur.com/t/imgurian_cookbook"><b>#ImgurianCookbook</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) or crafting (</span><a href="https://imgur.com/t/home_hobbyist"><b>#HomeHobbyist</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span></p>
<p><b>Amusing</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As the novelty of shelter-in-place wore off, we discovered that people not only leaned heavily on their favorite internet pastimes on Imgur, such as </span><a href="https://imgur.com/t/oddly_satisfying"><b>#OddlySatisfying</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, they also started to come up with new ways to stave off boredom. Take </span><a href="https://imgur.com/t/stay_at_home_games"><b>#StayatHomeGames</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for example, where people shared how they </span><a href="https://imgur.com/t/stay_at_home_games/ZWYQwqR"><span style="font-weight: 400;">juggled rings</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> or tested the limits of their family bond by </span><a href="https://imgur.com/t/stay_at_home_games/0tU2c1o"><span style="font-weight: 400;">playing Monopoly on not just one board but on two boards simultaneously</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, we discovered that people are very interested in rallying around events that may seem silly but ultimately give them a sense of belonging to the Imgur community. Our annual April Fool’s prank this year was inspired by our community’s inside joke, known as “</span><a href="https://imgur.com/t/banana_for_scale"><b>#BananaforScale</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” We implemented </span><a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/MhSXnLA"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a banana button</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that allowed users to measure posts on Imgur on a sliding banana scale. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In response, Imgur users shared </span><a href="https://imgur.com/t/banana_for_scale/fPjRAdj"><span style="font-weight: 400;">banana art</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://imgur.com/t/banana_for_scale/YQbAJ1a"><span style="font-weight: 400;">created banana GIFs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and even showed off </span><a href="https://imgur.com/t/banana_for_scale/TgL3Kug"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a picture of their new puppy next to a banana</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. With over 1 million clicks on the banana button in the span of a day, it’s clear that sharing a laugh over something that might only be funny to a specific group of people can be a source of powerful connection during a time of crisis.</span></p>
<p><b>As a Marketer, How Can Your Brand Participate?</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The spread of COVID-19 has presented humanity with an unprecedented challenge on a global scale. In an era when Millennials and Gen Z are already </span><a href="https://www.advertisingweek360.com/what-generation-z-think-of-generation-z/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">suspicious about the motives of large brands</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it can seem like the best foot forward is to stay quiet during this time. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Research has shown otherwise. On March 16th, IPSOS interviewed 999 adults aged 18-65 through a poll, and the </span><a href="https://www.ipsos.com/ipsos-mori/en-uk/covid-19-creative-fightback"><span style="font-weight: 400;">results</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> overwhelmingly pointed to people’s desire to hear from helpful brands. 74% of respondents agreed with the following statement: “I want to continue to hear from brands and companies on what they have to offer.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brands now have a unique opportunity to step up and interact with people in a meaningful way. Here are some communication strategies that we’ve come up with to help brands who are struggling with how to engage their customers right now.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><b>Create and distribute content that provides value</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First and foremost, people want to know what they and their loved ones need to stay safe and healthy. In this time of uncertainty, people are also looking for guidance and a sense of reassurance as they adjust to their new normal. In the same poll created by IPSOS, 71% of respondents said that they are interested in hearing from brands that can help them navigate the crisis. It’s also important to note here that we’ve found that 69% of the top performing pieces of branded content on Imgur in 2019 were informational in nature. Here is </span><a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/7WDirxV"><span style="font-weight: 400;">an example</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of a post we created with tips on how to stay active mentally and physically while social distancing. </span></p>
<ol start="2">
<li><b>Foster and facilitate digital campfires that help people stay connected and entertained. </b></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Membership within digital campfires is built around a common interest or pastime. One straightforward way for brands to join or even start a digital campfire is to host a virtual event that is of interest to the audience they are trying to reach. We believe that people are looking for fun and interesting things to do as a respite from their new reality. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, brands have successfully engaged Imgur’s meme-loving Millennial and Gen Z audience with the </span><a href="https://imgur.com/a/8wnGehI"><span style="font-weight: 400;">GIF Creator Challenge</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, where a select number of Imgur power users are invited to create GIFs that tap into timely events or trends. Imgur users at large are then invited to participate by voting on their favorite GIFs. </span></p>
<ol start="3">
<li><b>Empower people to give back. </b></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">News about COVID-19 may leave some people feeling helpless. To combat this, brands can step up to inspire positivity and change. For example, last year, Mike’s Hard Lemonade invited Imgur users to share stories about their families and helped 2 of them fly home to surprise their parents, including </span><a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/ZIQ6DZw/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a veteran who had not seen his mother in years</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another example is Tito’s Handmade Vodka, which</span><a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/qkiqKLy"> <span style="font-weight: 400;">partnered with Imgur</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to award $5,000 every quarter to a special person who will use it to make a difference in their community. Brands that have given back to their communities or given people the means to do so have had resounding success on Imgur in the past.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While it may seem daunting for brands to step up to the plate during this time, data shows that people expect brands to stay active. With the right creative and messaging, brands can earn trust and confidence from people who need their products and services. Reach out to the Imgur team for help crafting brand stories that will help lift people’s spirits during this challenging time.</span></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yellow, Imgurians!</p>
<p>Yesterday we unveiled our groundbreaking Potassium Evaluation and Examination Logic, or P.E.E.L, to the world; in the hopes that we could once and for all codify the Banana for Scale as the one true measurement. </p>
<p>With your help we were able to conduct extensive research, crunch some serious numbers and gather vital information that we hope will convince entire civilizations of something that the internet has known for years.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at the deets!</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.imgur.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BananaInfographic.png"><img src="http://blog.imgur.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BananaInfographic.png" alt="BananaInfographic" width="3304" height="2000" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12888" /></a></p>
<p>Some posts really captured Imgurian’s imaginations and raked in an alarming amount of bananas, while others blew us away with their sheer averageness!</p>
<blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="x8d3gI1" data-context="false"><p><a href="//imgur.com/x8d3gI1"></a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>After chewing the numbers, we have come to the conclusion that the Banana for Scale is the perfect scale on which all other measurements should be based, and therefore cannot be quantified by simple numbers. Ultimately the true Banana for Scale is the friends we made along the way. </p>
<p>We are sending a report of our findings to the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and the United States Federal Government. We’re goin’ straight to the top, folks!</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.imgur.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/204479f5d34142c85f134e75e0a56539.png"><img src="http://blog.imgur.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/204479f5d34142c85f134e75e0a56539.png" alt="204479f5d34142c85f134e75e0a56539" width="793" height="753" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12889" /></a></p>
<p>Thanks a bunch for all your valiant efforts in this endeavor. Although the P.E.E.L has been resigned to history, it will live on in our hearts.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Coming in fresher than grandma’s apple pie, we’re excited to bring you the latest updates in our ongoing redesign on Imgur for desktop &#8212; a new look for the post page! Complete with a friendlier feel and intuitive design, we hope the new browsing experience will take you to levels of memes and magic never before thought possible. <strong>Currently, this view is displayed to all logged out users.</strong></p>
<p>Over the past ten years, Imgur has grown from the simple image host of yore to the best place on the Internet to enjoy community-powered entertainment. In 2018, we put a new look to the new era by introducing a new desktop homepage experience that better suits the Imgurian of today, but the place where the true magic happens &#8212; the posts &#8212; hasn’t been touched since a basic update to the voting icons in 2016. </p>
<p><a href="http://blog.imgur.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/c9903e6de0eb0470c6bc91fe6fc236a2.png"><img src="http://blog.imgur.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/c9903e6de0eb0470c6bc91fe6fc236a2.png" alt="c9903e6de0eb0470c6bc91fe6fc236a2" width="1352" height="980" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12882" /></a></p>
<p>If you happen to be a logged-in user, we’re also inviting you to <a href="https://imgur.com/beta/enable">opt-in</a> to this updated view and the whole host of enhancements that come with it. While it’s still in beta, we welcome you to test it, hammer it, and reticulate its splines.</p>
<p><strong>Among the improvements included in this update are:</strong></p>
<p>New video scaling. Gone are the days of scrolling the page to see a full video. See whole wholesome puppers, less cut-off-video blues. Aww yiss.</p>
<p>The scroll bar has been updated to keep you ahead of the spiciest memes. Posts you’ve previously viewed will be greyed out, meaning you can optimize your Memes Per Minute (MPM) to the max. We’ve opened up the scroll bar to show you greater post detail, allowing you to cherry-pick your next post, or hit that right arrow key on your keyboard to move ahead.</p>
<p>Upvotes, downvotes, favoriting, sharing, downloading, and reporting stays in view as you scroll the entire post. Upvote early and often. A handy-dandy button lets you jump straight into the comments section when the perfect pun hits. </p>
<p>Comments have been revamped to improve flow and readability!</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.imgur.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/be52a98e1bfcfed289d8ecccd4f42e5c.png"><img src="http://blog.imgur.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/be52a98e1bfcfed289d8ecccd4f42e5c.png" alt="be52a98e1bfcfed289d8ecccd4f42e5c" width="1102" height="653" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12883" /></a></p>
<p>We hope you&#8217;ll love this new look as much as we do! Huge thanks and socially distant hugs to our amazing testers who helped shape this design, and allowed us to make important tweaks and fixes that ensure this new look is the best update yet.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For decades, the debate between metric and imperial has divided nations and families. Today we’re embarking on a humanitarian mission to heal that split and bring the internet together under one true measurement &#8212; the Banana for Scale. </p>
<p>Today we’re proud to introduce the Potassium Evaluation and Examination Logic (P.E.E.L), our state-of-the-art measuring tool, which, with your help, will codify the humble Banana for Scale into one standard unit of measure that can be used for internet generations to come.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.imgur.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/promotedpost-aprilfools20-3.jpg"><img src="http://blog.imgur.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/promotedpost-aprilfools20-3.jpg" alt="promotedpost-aprilfools20-3" width="720" height="400" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12873" /></a></p>
<p>For fifteen years the internet has been using these berry helpful fruits to quantify all sorts of objects, from televisions to Tom Hanks. The internet’s unofficial yardstick has enlightened millions and provided scale and construct to online content worldwide. </p>
<p>Here are some real conversations:<br />
“Have you see this chonky raccoon? He’s at least 4 bananas thicc.”<br />
“A marvel of human engineering, the Empire State Building is 2,140 bananas tall”</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.imgur.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/promotedpost-aprilfools20-2.jpg"><img src="http://blog.imgur.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/promotedpost-aprilfools20-2.jpg" alt="promotedpost-aprilfools20-2" width="720" height="300" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12874" /></a></p>
<p>Help Imgur define the ISO standard length of a banana by teaching our Potassium Evaluation and Examination Logic what the average banana size is. In our research, we’ve discovered that there are, in fact, multiple species and sizes of bananas. In order to petition for the banana to be an official unit of measure, we need the community’s help to define the one true standard size.</p>
<p>Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is use your knowledge and understanding of the banana to apply the P.E.E.L on all posts you see on Imgur. In doing so, you’ll teach our machine learning algorithm how many bananas could fit inside each post. Perhaps a kitten would require just one banana. A vast landscape? It could be 8,542 bananas. Look deep within to determine the true number of bananas. </p>
<p>P.E.E.L will slice, glaze, and mash the contents of the image or video with your banana input to provide us with one average banana size. This will be no small task (at least 90 bananas), but it is sure to codify the unit that moves us into the future of measurement and bring humanity back together. We believe in you, and good luck.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A random slice of kindness can go a long way to making the world a brighter place &#8211; And for Imgurians in need, there’s an army of doughy divines ready to dish out some cheesy generosity. </p>
<p>This National Pizza Day we&#8217;re celebrating the <a href="http://imgur.com/user/TheFreePizzaDude">TheFreePizzaDude,</a> and his Pizza Angels, who band together once a week to send pizza across the globe to sate hungry bellies; but where did these hunger banishers appear from? We asked the man behind the project for an insight!  </p>
<blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="a/Mpbk62F"><p><a href="//imgur.com/a/Mpbk62F">Hi everyone, I&#39;m TheFreePizzaDude</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>“I had a $300 bonus from work and live pretty frugally, so I wanted to give it away somehow,” he explained, “It started randomly in Usersub. I came across this post, commented, and eventually got someone a pizza. It was a week later I started the new username for one big pizza post.”</p>
<p>“Just one post, one time, that was it. I&#8217;d never go back to the username.”</p>
<p>The identity of TheFreePizzaDude remained a mystery until it was revealed that it was none other than legendary Imgurian <a href="http://imgur.com/user/MrPuckett">@MrPuckett</a> behind the program &#8211; <a href="http://blog.imgur.com/2019/03/27/a-qa-with-mrpuckett-imgurs-king-of-wholesome/">An Imgurian we’ve featured here in the past. </a></p>
<p>Originally inspired by the pizza giveaway by <a href="https://blog.imgur.com/2018/01/29/a-slice-of-generosity/">@pizzasonly</a>, TheFreePizzaDude has grown into its own weekly event; “To me, it’s proof that people want to be helpful,” he explained, when asked on the meaning of the project, “Individually &#8211; we often don’t know how to help other people or groups, but these posts give a pretty clear outline on how you can spend ten minutes and make someone else’s day better.”</p>
<blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="a/dmSTssx"><p><a href="//imgur.com/a/dmSTssx">Hi everyone, I&#39;m TheFreePizzaDude</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Setting up, and running, something on the scale of TheFreePizzaDude is no small feat, as Abe explained, taking vast amounts of organization and communication. There is a formula to helping as many people as possible, “Pizza days always start four hours early on <a href="http://imgur.com/user/mrpuckett">@MrPuckett,</a> so by the time <a href="http://imgur.com/user/TheFreePizzaDude">@TheFreePizzaDude</a> comes around, it’s hopefully in Most Viral, and as many people as possible can see it. I also message the few dozen people I missed during the week and we’re off.”</p>
<p>“Then it’s 8 hours of madness.”</p>
<p>To date, the project has sent an incredible 1,382 pizzas to Imgurians in need, which if laid end-to-end, would rival some of the world’s tallest skyscrapers at 1,612ft of pizza! That’s a lot of ‘za. </p>
<blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="a/lLyma"><p><a href="//imgur.com/a/lLyma">Skyscraper pizza</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Interested in taking part? Posts appear either on a Friday or a Saturday &#8211; So jump in and spread the love! </p>
<p>“If you ask people to help, many of them will. If you give people a way to help, that can be silly and fun, you’ll never have a shortage of helpers.” </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 2010s saw the internet truly embrace a culture of its own. Memes became the internet’s preferred form of communication. Some memes gained cult followings or had entire communities spring up around them, others fizzled and vanished within the blink of an eye. Regardless, all of them passed through Imgur’s gates. </p>
<p>With the decade coming to a close, we asked Imgurians to decide, once and for all, which meme was their favorite meme from the 2010s. From two-thousand nominations, the top ten were selected to battle it out in the final round. A total of 54,768 votes were cast in 72 hours by Imgurians. It was a close race, but we’re proud to announce Imgur’s <a href="http://imgur.com/t/memeofthedecade">Meme of the Decade</a> is…</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.imgur.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/harold-0.jpg"><img src="http://blog.imgur.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/harold-0.jpg" alt="harold-0" width="2500" height="1667" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12842" /></a></p>
<p>Hide the Pain Harold, Imgur’s Meme of the Decade! Hide the Pain Harold represents a deep-seated emotion, a quiet dread, or existential anguish that resides in all of us. </p>
<p>“Can you come in on your day off?”<br />
“Can I call you?”<br />
“Your card has been declined.”</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.imgur.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Harold.png"><img src="http://blog.imgur.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Harold.png" alt="Harold" width="2000" height="500" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12843" /></a></p>
<p>Feel the pain. Now push it all the way down. Conceal don’t feel. Smile. Congratulations, you’re Hiding the Pain.</p>
<p>Harold’s agonized smile first graced the internet all the way back in 2011, popping up on forums and social media as a beacon of relatable suffering. Steadily growing in popularity between 2011 and 2014, Harold is the meme that keeps on memeing &#8212; remaining relevant throughout the entire decade. </p>

<p>The man behind the meme is András Arató, a retired lighting engineer from Hungary, for whom the sudden spotlight of internet fame came as a surprise. After posting vacation photos to a Hungarian community website, he was contacted by a photographer interested in using the then sixty-five-year-old Arató in a number of stock photo shoots. According to an interview with The Independent in 2017, it wasn&#8217;t until a couple of years later that Arató learned of his internet fame, saying, “At first I saw only normal stock photos, where I was a doctor or a lawyer or a professor or something like this. Some months later I found my first meme photo. On an American site.” </p>
<p>Ten years, and six million memes later, Arató has embraced his unconventional stardom, appearing on international television, giving TED Talks, and being <a href="https://imgur.com/t/harold/GlYhs">recognized globally by excited Imgurians.</a> </p>
<p><a href="http://blog.imgur.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/a1ea4df356c798225294b42e3f5e9555.png"><img src="http://blog.imgur.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/a1ea4df356c798225294b42e3f5e9555.png" alt="a1ea4df356c798225294b42e3f5e9555" width="1239" height="745" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12844" /></a></p>
<p>As for our other nominees, it was a photo(shopped) finish between Hide the Pain Harold and <a href="https://imgur.com/user/ANewBadlyPhotoshoppedPhotoofMichaelCeraEveryday">@ANewBadlyPhotoshoppedPhotoofMichaelCeraEveryday</a>, with just under 2% difference between these two Imgur titans. This is Fine settled into third. </p>
<p>Carrying the back half of the votes were stellar efforts from the sorely missed Grumpy Cat and Nodding Gandalf, with a collective 22.4%; the remaining entries earned a generous 23.3% of the vote.</p>
<p><a href="http://blog.imgur.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/QDZxBMg.jpg"><img src="http://blog.imgur.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/QDZxBMg.jpg" alt="QDZxBMg" width="3000" height="2000" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12845" /></a></p>
<p>Thank you to everyone who took the time to cast a nomination or vote. If Harold wasn’t your top choice, perhaps his meme will convey how you feel. Cheers to the roaring 20s and the many many yet undiscovered memes to come.</p>
