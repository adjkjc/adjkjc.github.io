<P>
ABSTRACT:  Left Occipital Areas L-17/18 seem to perform the same 
neurological functions for visual conversion of 2-D retinal visual sensory 
information signals into 3-D semiotic mental representations as the 
involvement of Broca-Wernicke area in the conversion of aural sensory signals 
into a finite set of sound types producing neurolinguistic patterns.  
Self-similar (ergodic) distribution throughout the brain of a visual semiotic 
language comprised of a finite alphabet of basic images would appear to 
consist of lissajous-like patterns operating in two modalities:  resonating 
electromagnetic mode, and a morphological (structural reconfiguration) mode.  
Recall of visual forms of memory would suggest a biological identification via 
invariance as the result of quantum encoding in the protein microtubulin (MT) 
of the neuropil.  Machine emulation of human sentient computing would 
require both local and non-local access to binding networks of semiotic 
languages in the brain. 
<P><BR>
<B>1.0  INTRODUCTION</B>
<P>
1.1  There is a preponderance of uniquely human brain structure related to 
sentient processes on the left side hemisphere of the cerebral cortex.  This 
is most likely due to the flow of blood from the heart (Pribram, personal 
discussion 1991).  The left side of the brain is presented with a richer 
amount of brain nutrients than is the right side of the brain.  Accordingly, the left 
side of the human brain consists of a much more knotty topology.  
<P>
Broca-Wernicke in the left temporal region is implicated in the emergence of neurolinguistic 
activity.  Left Occipital Lobe Area 17 and surrounding Area 18 is implicated 
in the emergence of visual mental representations.  <a href="http://www.acsa2000.net/catscan.gif">[click here for PET Image of this structure]</a> In both linguistic and visual 
areas, if the associated cortex is not presented with adequate sensory 
stimulation during initial brain structural formation, there is a 
correspondent diminuition to complete lack of development of human sentient word/thought 
and visual pattern recognition capability later in life.  This would suggest 
that there are critical early morphological conditions supporting neurocomputation 
and neurocommunication that consolidate into a binding network that 
produces sentient behavior.  
<P>
Given that sentient behavior, to include a posteriori learning,  
can still be evidenced in the human brain after damage or dysfuntion of the 
left hemispheric region occurs, would suggest that the central nervous 
system (CNS) distributes learned information patterns throughout the entire 
brain structure.  A lissajous-like self-similar dissemination of processed 1/f 
invariant sensory signal information from initial cortex receptor sites is 
posited.  
<P>
Encoding discrimination of biologic sensory information is accomplished by 
quantum shift keying (QSK).  QSK originates in the orchestrated reduction (OR) of 
quantum entanglement at specific electromagnetic resonating frequency 
locations in protein microtubulin in the neuropil.  QSK is then communicated 
via oscillating and standing waves in the neurosynaptic - dendritic region.  This 
resonating mode is either reinforced or reduced by related binding, 
non-binding activity in other regions of the brain.  At certain frequency and energy 
thresholds, a combining resonance is established in brain function that binds 
the various oscillating brain subresonances into a cohesive, sentient pattern. 
<P>
Crick (94) suggests that this combining resonance occurs when the brain 
enters into a special 40+ Hz binding frequency regime.  There is evidence that sentient energy 
thresholds are significant, because there is a residue of human specific 
adenosine tri-phoshate (ATP) in the blood following cognitive (sentient) 
episodes.  This residue does not appear in other animals and would suggest 
human specific thought processes.  Binding processes also appear to cause 
morphological changes in the brain.  The role of nitrogen molecule and 
crystalline H2O resonance is essential to the binding process.  As the brain 
undergoes various stages of neuronal sprouting, consolidation and pruning, 
plasticity of the microtubulin provides the brain with the ability to adapt and codify useful 
sensory infomation signals into semi-permanent pathways.  
<P>
Hameroff (90's) indicates that calpain is a primary neuromolecule that softens brain protein 
microtubulin (MT), which after a electromagnetic resonance wave interference 
pattern (holonomic) is presented onto the MT, the calpain is dissipated and a 
structural imprint of the QSK encoded wavefront interference pattern is thus 
captured in biologic protein structure.   Sufficient memory storage mechanisms would be
available in the brain to overcome state cycle limitations, since no synapto-dendritic region 
physically touches any other in the human brain.  This establishes myriad number of
switching pathways for random, but QSK coded, information patterns to be stored, with 
self-similar recall features in place.  Access to any part of the lissajous-like distribution 
pattern would allow eventual reconstruction of the invariant information stored in 
holonomic memory.  Internal stimulation of the resonant frequency modality or the actual 
physical bandwidth would provide the brain with internal memory recall capability.  
Cognitive recall is comprised of Gabor Functions in Hilbert Space.  
<P>
Zero Point Energy - ZPE (Puthoff 89) could be the trigger effect in 1013-type MT 
providing the necessary resonant energy to overcome ATP thresholds, thus affording 
quantum entanglement options.  In conjunction with either acidic or base 
bound, crystalline water (H2O),  a 10 base MT  becomes a resonating 
biocomputer in the electric portion of an electromagnetic field.  A 13 
base MT becomes a resonating biocomputer in the magnetic field.  
Because proteins (as strings) can reconfigure (conformal deformation - 
change shapes), a 1013 MT forms the basis of a very powerful 3-D 
biocomputational structure.  Proteins can take shape around useful 
invariants extracted from frequency based information expressed in the 
electromagnetic field - learning.  
<P>
Invariance can be captured in MT by quantum encryption of various 
combinations of photons, phonons and electrons, which may 
synergistically produce, via solitons, a binding property of emergent 
epiphenomenon,  a biofield communication both local and non-local to the 
protein MT strings.  Calpain induced start/stops in the dendritic-synaptic 
receptors, with varying degrees of glial cell neurochemical nutrient infusion, 
turn on or off the QSK coded learning sequences in the MT.  As more and 
more of neuronal activity forms a topological geometry around these events, 
oscillating in concert, perceptual and then cognitive events transpire, 
suggesting a process for sensory to sentient computation.  
<P>
Stapp (96) would argue an orchestrated reduction (OR) to a single quantum state.  Prueitt (96), 
Globus (96), Norseen (96), and others would have a quantum entanglement 
that collapses not to a single state, but to a much more robust explosion (big 
bang) of quantum view.  From this viewstate, the Crick, Pribram holonomic 
binding would provide a Penrose brain/mind the following biological choices in order to attend to the afferent sensory input; 1.) Select from the semiotic hypotheses 
generated, 2.) Prefrontal lobe induced noise to defer selection, and transfer 
of the hypothesis generation/selection to control of the anterior cingulate and 
other neuronal subtopologies for a Prigogine like epiphenomenon of emergence, 
or 3.) Symmetry break and ignore, measurement (Kugler 95) indicates 
release of the quantum enfoldment event.  
<P>
Energy dissipation occurs in Modes 1 and 3.  Quantum Shift Key (QSK) coding occurs via OR events to Modes 1 and 2 allowing for encoded memory-based recall processes.  Non-cognitive attended symmetry and continued energy requirements are still afforded to Mode 2 - deferral, until a cognitive Mode 1 is achieved.  
<P>
Globus discussions would indicate this is the principle of 
cybernetic loops in consciousness.  Prueitt (96) would claim that initial 
memory is not required to initiate these processes, which suggests a basis for 
codelets as a basic QSK element to differentiate nature into groupings of natural kind.  
The human brain, without initial memory, can begin to learn by experiential and semiotic testing built around codelets, an original form of original kind strange attractor.  If such trigger learning is successful in establishing QSK encoded memories, then regular neuronal learning mechanisms become dominant.  In such fashion, the brain is capable of feeding itself critical information with, or without, memory as a necessary requirement.
<P>
Rough sets of similar information would share relatively common QSK cryptologic codes, 
and the presence of various categories of self-similar, reduced mathematical coefficient sets of natural codelets, may suggest a useful and powerful biologic mechanism to store and retrieve information efficiently - natural compression, decompaction.
<P><BR>
<B>2.0  THE SEMIOTIC PROCESS IN AREA L-17</B>
<P>
The semiotic alphabet brain region correlated in function to Broca-Wernicke 
would be primarily the specific subtopology of the cerebral cortex in the left 
posterior occipital region, Area L-17.  Surrounding Area 17 in both the left 
and right rear hemispheres of the brain is a different grouping of brain cells and 
neuronal pathways with connections to the rest of the brain - Area 18.  Area 
17 and Area 18 take visual information from the eyes and structurally perform a 
2-D to 3-D semiotic conversion of objects in the field of view of the eyes 
into an internal mental representation of visual reality for dissemination to other 
regions of the brain (Kabrisky 66).  Only three (3) genes control the human 
visual process.  This indicates that substantial signal extraction and signal 
processing is involved in the human visual schema.  
<P>
The direct neuronal sensory high fidelity input from the human fovea to Area 17 is greater in 
humans than any other species.  This would indicate that the human visual 
semiotic 3-D mental representation is also greater than in other species.  
<P>
There is also a significant amount of otherwise 'hard wired' as opposed to 
soft signal processing in the direct visual coupling into Area 17.  Certain aspects 
of prosopopoeia, specific facial features indicating authority, and certain edge 
and top-bottom receptors, directly fire neuronal complexes in Area 17, as well 
as in the amygdala raising stress/anxiety reactions, and in the learned motor 
response complexes of the cerebellum.  The combination of spectrum-based codelets
and muscle contractions in the lense of the eyes are probably associated with the
human homeostatic condition; for example: the pineal gland hormonal responses to
whole spectrum natural light / brightness, such as implicated in the release of
melatonin.
<P>
Area 17 and 18 interpret the images that the brain must respond to, deal with, that form the world of visual language, the semiotic languages that form our unique interaction with the world - the human personal visual signature.  There are not thousands of images in the semiotic alphabet.  There are not hundreds.  Just as in Broca-Wernicke area where only about forty (40) sound types form the basis of culturally expressed language, there are a relatively small number of images 
in the visual semiotic alphabet.  However, the combination and reconfiguration of 
this finite set is still able to produce the myriad complexity of mental 
representation producing creativity, insight, color, and dreams which form the 
basis of the human experience.  
<P>
The human brain is actually many brains.  Not only left and right, but front and back, top and bottom.  And it is really many little brains sometimes acting (binding) as one, to cognate, to think, but many brain processes are acting without volitional cognition.  It would seem that 
the great percentage of the human mental world is non-cognitive, and 
non-conscious, even unconscious.  
<P>
Accordingly, there are many languages in  the brain.  Each brain language, to 
include emotions, would appear to have its own alphabet.  The central 
thesis is on the finite set - the alphabet of images in the 
brain.  
<P>
This image alphabet makes up a semiotic internal visualization of self-image 
and world reality that we call, 'us.'  The visual enfoldment describes a 
relatively small, but consistent number of archetype images that the 
Brain/Central Nervous System must respond to and deal with for survival.  
<P>
This is a powerful concept:  That a handful of images can shape 
the self-identity of a person, a group, a society, a culture.
<P>
Vincent van Gogh cut off his left ear to give to a trollop, but his self-protrait perspective of the event portrayed a sliced up right ear.  Even considering he was using a mirror to paint himself, he still transforms to the outside world observer the impression of destruction of an opposite form of himself.
<P>
Rather than the accepted interpretation that in some fit of rage, he was performing self-inflicted surgery to relieve an inner ear infection, could there really have been some hypersensitivity, some extreme antinomy, to van Gogh's Broca-Wernicke area, in that he was trying to silence internal voices, in a phase locked loop, that were compelling him in some tortuous semiotic malady?
<P>
That the reversed perspective of right and left is also expressed would indicate that van Gogh could have also had some combination of  dysfunction in left Occipital Lobe Area 17, problems in the Area 18 3-D semiotic dispersion throughout the cerebral cortex, and/or disrupted intracollasal transfer in the corpus callosum.  Depending on whether van Gogh painted with his right or left hand could also impune his cerebellum as an ironic contributor to the amazing agony expressed so passionately and beautifully in van Gogh's works of art.
<P>
Left Occipital Lobe Visual Area 17 and Semiotic Conversion Area 18 can also be considered likely candidate contributors to the dream induced prosopopoeia directly causing Robert Louis Stevenson's creative reconstruction of a reverie - an internal semiotic mental representamen:  Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, perhaps also influenced by the effects of single blend, all malt scotch whiskey alcohol vapors in the nighttime air in the environs of Edinburgh University.
<P>
Area 17 and 18 could also be the semiotic trigger point for the nocturnal succuba visitation to Giuseppe Tartini in the 1700's, resulting in a pure musical orchestration crosslink in Broca-Wernicke area:  the haunting Faustian sounds in Trillo del Diavolo, the Devil's Trill.
<P>
From what can be arguably ascribed as temporal lobe epilepsy that affected the visual and sound distortions in Alice in Wonderland, by Lewis Carroll, to the selection by Goya, in Toledo, Spain, of the 'chosen' insane to pose as the portraitures of the Disciples touched by God, to many of the bizarre, to include metempsychotic, renderings of possessed artists, to the Deja Vu and Jamais Vu, and the many fold synergies of ergodic self-similarity expressed by Escher:  the Hand of the Area 17, 18 semiotic process is at play.
<P>
The semiotic binding process across the cerebral cortex and deep down into the glial cells, the wellsprings feeding the information fields of the synapto-dendritic layers under control of fiefdoms and kingdoms of rival neuropils, picks and choses among competing 3-D mental representations in lissajous fashion.  The semiotic down selection of Gabor Functions in Hilbert Space is the focus of attention characterized by an Einstein internally discerning mathematics, to the sweet memories of happiness down the perceived passage of time, clocked by the striatum in the basal ganglia.
<P>
Semiotic binding seems to work best when the brain is entrained between 7.83 Hz and 14 Hz, with special tunneling and neurochemical surges in the 9 to 10 Hz regime.  The meditative Theta and modified Alpha-Theta states would appear to be the quiet zones where the ability to attend to internal mental representations can best be captured for reconstruction back through the efferent central nervous system pathways to show the world what floats in the mind.  This delivery mechanism which brings forth creation back into the world in any number of newly reconfigured states (eolithic capacity) could be the semiotic description for the concepts in Richard Dawkins 1970's notion of 'The Building Blocks of Comprehension,' the Thought Memes, the Culturgen.
<P>
When such a semiotic process is flowing without difficulty, a state of grace, almost of not knowing, exists.  However, noise and symmetry breaking and chaos is ever lurking in nature, if only to shatter the present to get to the future:  To establish a new condition of test and survival.
<P>
Perhaps the tortured expression of a van Gogh is his attempt to return to a semiotic state of grace.
<P>
From Shakespeare, '...per chance to Dream.'  If the semiotic process of binding creativity is evident in the dream Theta and meditative Alpha brain wave activity, and it appears to go on the fritz in the hyperactive Beta states, verging on out of control frenzied, phase locked loops and symmetry breaking madness bypassing 30 Hz, then what happens to the semiotic process in deep, deep sleep, the periods of seeming total non-conscious activity of Delta, and some comas, way down at 1 to 3, 4, 5 Hz?  Humans enter this extremely dangerous twilight zone on average of three times per night, for about twenty minutes each.  For one hour total each night, we slip the surely bonds of semiotics and lay prey to another's survival.  Evidently, Delta sleep is involved with restoring the mental calibrations and nutrient stores necessary for sentient behavior.
<P>
The range of cognitive and non-cognitive control (lucid dreaming) of semiotic processes in some brain states and the inability to take telelogical advantage of semiotic processes in other brain states, to include chemical and electromagnetic induced entrainment, would suggest strongly that semiotic function is related to brain morphology and resonance.
<P>
When brain structure is put into a certain condition, semiotics occurs.  As well, when brain structure is resonantly changed into another state, semiotics does not occur.  Human brain structure can be shown to be significantly different is some neuronal subtopological regions than in any other species.  Therefore, humans may engage in, due to their species specific brain structures resonating at certain brain frequency states, purely human semiotic experiences.  These purely human semiotic experiences bind us not only as individual structurally different contributors, but as mutual individual participants to a common, larger human semiotic pool of information and creativity.  If the human brain continues to evolve, and semiotics is critical to that evolution, then semiotic control will also continue to evolve.
<P>
Just as humans have developed machines as prosthetic devices to augment or outperform human function, then it would follow that initial emulation of semiotic processes in mental 3-D representation would be emplaced in machine logic.  If internal to semiotic function is the innate ability to reconfigure information into new forms of perception, creativity, comprehension, and knowledge, then at some point in machine semiotic logic, machine semiotics could emerge in startingly different and dramatic fashion from human semiotics:  This would signal a strict delineation, the Dawn of the Sentient Computational Era.  
<P><BR>
<B>3.0  SEMIOTICS</B>
<P>
Semiotics is the science of signs.  The Peircian triadic form of semiotics 
involves combinations of Symbols, Indexes, and Icons, that form Signs (Ketner 
96).  Signs transform Objects from Reality into Mental Representations.  
Sentient activity is the process of transforming reality into mind for 
reconfiguration and the creative infusion back into reality.  When humans 
dream, or create, or bring up images of faces of loved ones, or replay 
memories in the theater of mind, there is a utilization of Peircian triadic 
logic - a semiotic process.
<P>
Within the field of semiotics, the work of Charles Peirce would suggest avenues by which the logic of discovery employed by biological systems could be captured for insertion into machine logic and symbolic computation.  If human eolithic semiotic processes are indeed related to algebraic topologies, structural geometries, and critical resonating information field frequencies, then advanced mathematics are required to accomodate the complex range of transformations necessary to synchronize human mental and machine logic interactions.  The emerging mathematical investigations into Transfigural Mathematics (Shakunle 96) suggest avenues amenable for the conversion and transformation of human semiotics instantiated into machine semiotic processes.
<P>
The influence of Peirce's work in the late 1800's, recompiled by Dr. Burkes at Harvard in the 1940's and 50's, can be seen in the current investigations of John Holland, from the University of Michigan in EE/CS, now at the Sante Fe Institute.  Holland is working on the next generation of Genetic Algorithms and Adaptive Complex Systems.
<P>
Semiotics stands to benefit from a robust interchange not only from standard scientific circles, but also from ideas and concepts and themes that come from non-standard scientific domains, even if controversial. There is a large body of useful insight to be gained from relooking  historical, and contemporary, and even future assertions on the human condition that may not come neatly packaged in classic scientific wrapping.

Also, Matthew Kabrisky:  'A Proposed Model for Visual Information Processing in the Human Brain.'  The writings of Pennfield and Lashley, Ashby and Weiner, Persinger, Changeux and D'Arcy Thompson, and of D.L. Koruga, 'Neurocomputing and Consciousness,' set the stage for a growing network of accessible researchers, colleagues, and professional talent capable of developing methods and techniques that can tailor specific mind/brain semiotic-sentient solutions.
<P>
Recently, on 15 May 1996, Dr. Karl Pribram of the Radford University BRAINS Research Center, presented a masterful lecture at Georgetown University, in which he formulated an architecture for a 21st Century mind/brain multidisciplinary research paradigm, the title of which is:
"The Deep and Surface Structures of Memory and Conscious Learning: Toward a 21st Century Model."
<P>
Pribram's model, in concert with the brain plasticity work in protein microtubulin of Stuart Hameroff, and in the quantum entanglement work with Roger Penrose, and others, serves as a solid baseline for continuing work by many different scientific research and development communities.
<P>
As the scientific community shifts to a virtual world of internetted, multidisciplinary electronic laboratories (E-Labs), the emergence of Images of Mind:  The Semiotic Alphabet is part of an ongoing research and development program contained in the evolution of the Applied Para-Mechanics Lab (APL), which is mutually participating and supporting the maturation of the Sentient Machine Laboratory (SML).
<P>
Of note, the United States Air Force Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) report, "New World Vistas - 21st Century," commissioned by the Secretary of the Air Force and co-signed by the Chief of Staff (94), concluded in 1996, on pages 50 and 51 of the Executive Summary that:
<P><UL>
'...Novel enhancements in Human-Machine Interaction...be aggressively pursued.  The ultimate interaction is Thought Control.'  
</UL>
<P>
Semiotic based approaches are suggested for the next millenium control of Intelligent Systems, including Uninhabited Combat Aeronautical Vehicles.
<P>
Computational theorists forecast that over the next twenty years, the current generation of machine intelligence will rapidly flow toward Quantum computers, to Biologic computers, to Sentient computers in the year 2020.  Such forecasts require fundamental breakthroughs in determining how the Human-Animal engages the processes of the Central Nervous System to achieve conscious and non-cognitive awareness.  Just as the 'Double Helix' gave way to recombinant DNA of the human genome, the binding process of Human Thought may give way to bioelectromagnetic manipulation - unlocking the critical quantum resonances of human microtubulin in the neuropil, human brain frequencies, the keys to Consciousness, of Sentient Life, to alter reality.
<P><BR>
<B>4.0  ALPHABET OF IMAGES</B>
<P>
Here is the alphabet of images that become the human visual language via the 
semiotic processes triggered in L-17/18.  The brain deals with a set of images that form an alphabet for visual language. 
<P>
The brain also uses a set of up to about forty (40) sound types to form our 
'neurolinguistic' spoken languages. Accordingly, there appear to be other languages in the brain; for emotion, for kinesthetics, perhaps even for morality.
<P>
Each language is directly related to both specific and dispersed subregions of 
brain structure.  
<P>
Brain structure, neuronal morphology, is extremely important.  
The interlinking of the various neuronal subtopologies and the associated 
mental 'semiotic' languages is what affords us our condition as 'human-animal' 
sentient beings.  As we attend more or less to the different semiotic 
languages constantly reconfiguring the patterns in our brains, we communicate to 
ourselves internally and to others externally our sense of reality and purpose 
- our personal signature.
<P>
For verbal language, Broca-Wernicke on the left temporal side of the cerebrum 
is a critical structural region of the brain, taking sounds and dispersing the 
semiotic meanings throughout the lissajous-like distribution channels of the 
cortex.  Not all sounds in the brain are implicated through the ears.  
Thermoelastic pressure waves from microwave pulsing, internal brain 
dysfunctions, the 'in-bandwidth' signal memory recall in dreams, and other 
forms of invasive and non-invasive aural hallucinations can make the brain 
sense and then perceive it is hearing real sounds.
<P>
For Images of the Mind: The Semiotic Alphabet brain region correlated in 
function to Broca-Wernicke would be primarily the specific subtopology of the 
cerebral cortex in the left posterior Occipital region, Area L-17.   
<P>
Surrounding Area 17 in both the left and right rear hemispheres of the brain is a 
different grouping of brain cells and neuronal pathways with connections to the rest of 
the brain - Area 18.  
<P>
Area 17 and 18 take visual information from the eyes and structurally perform 
a semiotic conversion of objects in the field of view of the eyes to an internal 
3-D mental representation and interpretation of visual reality for dissemination to other 
regions of the brain.

<B>4.1  EYES  -  GREEN</B>
<P>
Green wavelengths are the baseline color of the 2-D to 3-D transformation of 
visual reality into the semiotic images of mind.  
<P>
The eyes are an extension of the brain.  Only three genes control the 
structural development of the human eyes, whereas thousands of genes orient the 
human olfactory sense/perceive neurology of smells.  Such a limited number of 
genes suggests that the eye-brain interpretation and conversion of high 
bandwidth visual sensory data into mental representations is predominantly 
accomplished by signal processing activities that generate an extremely 
efficient signal to noise separation.  Since images brought to mind, such as 
in dreaming, do not appear to contain any noise, suggests that the signal 
processing accomplished in the optical chiasmatic pathways culminating in 
Area 17 and Area 18 is a lossless compression-decompaction activity.
<P>
The eyes and the optic nerves are biologically configured to capture 
environmental information in the analog visual portion of the electromagnetic 
spectrum at roughly .4 to .7 micrometers (um) in wavelength.  The highest 
concentration of photoreceptors at the Macula-Fovea, situated above the optic 
nerve, is directly centered in the green portion of the electromagnetic 
spectrum, 5.5+ um.  The color green requires the least amount of signal 
feature extraction/processing energy expenditure in the human eye - brain.
<P>
From an evolutionary viewpoint, eye fatigue, and the associated sensory 
reduction of important visual information from the environment resulting from 
eye fatigue, would lead to a corresponding decrease in survival potential.  
<P>
That the color green is the primary spectrum focused into the Macula-Fovea, 
indicates that the human eye-brain genetic structure evolved around an energy 
conserving process with respect to an environment dominated by the reflection 
of green wavelengths.  For the human-eye brain, structured along an extremely 
efficient, energy conserving, noiseless signal extraction of useful environmental 
features, green is the baseline color.  
<P>
The Macula-Fovea field of view is one to one directly connected and mapped 
into an exact 2-D topological map into Area 17 in the Occipital regions of 
the brain, with information passing through the hypothalamic and cerebellum 
regions.  Area 18 is implicated in transforming Area 17 information into 
3-D semiotic images for dispersion throughout the central nervous 
system.  
<P>
Given that green is the primary color around which semiotic images of 
mind are formed, leads to the concept that different colors entering an energy conserving field of view will cause a change in the semiotic state.  The change in the semiotic state requires an energy expenditure.  Over time, the biological value to attend to or not attend to the different colors will become reinforced by survival and genetic factors.  
<P>
However, for the individual human, structurally capable of sensing and perceiving the electromagnetic visual spectrum, the eye-brain will automatically adjust and respond to colorful objects presented onto a green baseline field of view.   
<P>
When gazing onto a continuous field of green grass, the eye is immediately 
drawn to the white dash of a butterfly, or the bright yellow spot of a 
dandelion, or the sparkling glint of sunlight on a red reflective surface, or the 
standing shimmer of a rainbow.  
<P>
There is more than color that causes a semiotic image in the mind.  The eye 
also engages the following semiotic processes.
<P><BR>
<B>4.2  MOTION</B>
<P>
The eyes engage three distinct but overlapping fields of view, basically a 
central focus, with left/right edges, and top/bottom thresholds.  An object 
that crosses past any of these areas is detected by the eye-brain and causes 
instant cerebellum-efferent motor response without necessarily undergoing a 
complete optical-chiasma signal processing cycle.  The eye can therefore 
instantly trigger a response without thought. 
<P>
Various forms of motion are necessarily more alluring to the eye-brain.  The 
flight direction of a butterfly is indicative of the most captivating form of 
motion. The highly variable trajectory of the flight of a butterfly causes the brain 
to constantly break and form and break symmetry (Kugler 92), engaging all three 
fields of view of the eye.  There is an interesting potential connection in 
such forms of variable motion to the various payback schedules in gambling 
addictions, and the addictive process in the brain necessary to capture the 
focus of attention.  
<P>
When the schema of payback is irregular, but with aperiodic large 
fluctuations, addictive processes are strongest.  The other three schemas of lesser 
addictive process quality are; steady payback at lesser returns, steady 
payback at lesser returns with occasional large returns, and irregular, small returns. 
<P>
Various forms of 'gambling' stategies may be reflected in how different 
species exhibit learning and memory interaction with the environment.  Some animals, 
such as squirrels, rapidly forget where they buried large numbers of nuts, 
thus providing a rich chance for a new tree or food cache for another species.  
Some animals, such as squirrels under sudden, severe stress, lose all control 
over learned escape patterns due to the surge of neurochemicals in their 
brains.  Sometimes this is good in that a pursuing predator can't get an edge 
up on catching the squirrel for food.  But sometimes a squirrel in relative 
safety will unintentionally place itself in high risk situations, running back under 
a car.  
<P>
There must be something in the presentation of certain forms of visual 
information to the eye-brain that causes such radical behavioral responses.  
Signal structure invariants is suggested as containing sufficient information 
to trigger such response modalities.
<P>
As information is presented to the eyes, certain invariant characteristics are contained in the signal processing stream that the species can genetically observe or can learn to detect.  As the information passes through the retina and into the optical chiasmatic pathway, through the hippocampal region, in particular the amygdala, and into the cerebellum, where it is impressed on the cerebral cortex of Area 17 and Area 18, there exists the structural capacity for the central nervous system to act upon invariants at any time short of a complete visual saccade cycle, three times per second.   
<P>
Indicated is the following:  Certain parts of the brain, in particular the amygdala and the 
cerebellum, can detect invariant structures in visual information signals, 
prior to those signals reaching Area 17, and that invariants in visual informtion 
cause immediate non-cognitive CNS motor responses.  The amygdala is closely 
associated with spawning anxiety and fear based cerebellum responses 
executed without volition via the efferent nervous pathways.  Once a semiotic 
process is learned and disseminated to the cerebellum, or is contained as a 
genetically 'hard wired' response modality in the cerebellum, invariant 
trigger events in the information presented to the eye-brain will cause the CNS to 
automatically interact with the environment.  
<P>
Equally, the eye-brain will also automatically respond to a sensed and falsely perceived - but not cognitively registered set of invariants.  Just as we can swat at an annoying real bug that 
flys at our eyes, we can execute the same swat semiotically at a mental 
rendering of an annoying bug created due to the same invariants stored away 
or presented non-cognitively, or recalled as in dreams, or play-acting. 
<P>
The learned patterns of response in the cerebellum directly feed into the 
efferent nervous pathways and 'automaton' like behavior can take place, which 
can account for drug-induced learning without volitional cognition, and can 
explain why an intoxicated person can still perform complex activities such as driving a car - without cognizant memory of the activity.
<P>
Other forms of motion that break lock and entrain the brain visually are 
spinning, the flowing of water, rolling motion - wheels of any kind, and 
explosions.  Even apparent motion is sufficient to attract semiotic attention, such as the flicking of shadows when driving under overpasses.  The edges of sunlight and shadow cause the eyes to blink and cause the same tensing of the efferent pathways as actual motion.  Also, objects that loom small to large or zoom in large to small, which extend top or bottom out of our field of view cause semiotic change states and efferent tensing.  Large shapes that suddenly emerge, clocks ticking, pendulums, even the images of falling objects can all trigger brain entrainment.  
<P>
Different species set up different timing mechanisms to handle the biological 
significance to such breaking and resetting of attentional mechanisms, such 
as the striatum at the basal ganglia.  Pidgeons for example rapidly bob their 
heads up and down in a physical enforcement to break lock with their 
environmental information streams of attention.  In humans, the prefrontal 
lobes, primarily the left prefrontal, keep the attentional focus maintained.  
Rubbing the forehead is a form of physical manipulation to help the frontal 
lobe perform its function in maintaining symmetry and focus.  A karate chop to the 
back of the neck, or the methodical rubbing of the base of the neck, are again 
various techniques to physically manipulate the release of adenosine to cause 
changes in brain frequency states, herein a reduction of brain activity toward Delta state unconsciousness or to a Theta state dreamlike trance. 
<P><BR>
<B>4.3  DISTANCE:  THE 30+ MILE TO INFINITY BASELINE</B>
<P>
The eyes are fully capable of providing visual information into the brain 
resulting in either cognitive or non-cognitive central nervous system (CNS) patterns of  behavioral response.  
<P>
Underlying the CNS efferent motor pathway response 
effect must be certain triggers in the information flow from the eyes that 
causes non-volitional CNS efferent responses.  
<P>
On a curve of distance versus mental image size, images approaching the grow only slightly larger in the eye-brain, until approximately one arm's length from the eye - then images 
grow rapidly until about one to two inches from the eye.  
<P>
Structurally and via signal processing, images impact the brain dramatically within two to six feet of actual distance, or two feet to six feet of virtual semiotic distance.  
<P>
Semiotic images of mind are contained in mental representations roughly equivalent to two inches 
to two to six feet.
<P>
The eye-brain uses minimal energy when staring at objects at long distances out to infinity, such as to the horizon at sea, or to a mountain off in the distance, which 
normally falls into a range of about 30+ miles.  
<P>
Mountains and galaxies and the sun setting on the ocean's horizon would set up the distance energy baseline.
<P>
By presenting the eye-brain with distance information and then rapidly 
superpositioning information based on high semiotic content of two feet to two inches, entrains the brain in exactly the two optimal areas of the distance 
versus size curve by which the optical chiasmatic pathway is biologically 
structured in the human.
<P>
By simply combining the elements described in sections 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 
established, very powerful visual semiotic entrainment or symmetry breaking 
techniques can be established for either cognitive or non-cognitive, invariant based, learned or autonomic behavioral patterns in humans.
<P>
For example:  Information visualization presented to the eye-brain featuring a long, smooth vista of green grass, swaying and flowing toward a far off mountain would set the baseline.  Then in quick succession, the flash of a light, the fluttering of a butterfly, and the super-imposition of a looming object, such as a large airplane, spinning or illuminated to the semiotic distance of two feet to two inches would probably capture most humans attention, causing them to 
mentally shift from what they were currently doing or thinking.  
<P>
Given that human mental real estate doesn't allow for much polyphasic thinking, such an example demonstrates how the human semiotic process can be quickly captured and 
modified, and without conscious deliberation.
<P>
A nighttime information visualization equivalent could also be presented; 
wherein, the eye-brain is presented with moonlit expanses of water reaching 
out to the horizon, stars sparkling in the sky, fireflies blinking on and off 
at different rhythms, then total blackness, and the sudden eruption of a volcano, with red hot lava gushing and splurting, would also instantly occupy the human visual semiotic process.
<P><BR>
<B>4.4  PROSOPOPOEIA - FACES</B>
<P>
In the visual saccade of the human eye, the eyes move from left to upper right in three staggered movements once a second.  Rather than a continuous stream of
visual information, the saccade results in three bursts of information sent 
from the eyes into the optical chiasmatic pathways to the left rear and right 
rear portions of the cerebrum.        
<P>
Because of the high bandwidth of information in the pulses of visual sensory 
information from the eyes and the very limited amount of physical space to 
accomplish signal to noise separation in the ten inches or so from the eyes 
to Area 17, the eye-brain structurally manipulates visual information in order to accomplish the extraction of useful environmental features from the 
bandwidth.  
<P>
Whereas the nose is very close to the olfactory receptor sites in the brain, 
an inch or two, as well as the ears are also very close physically to 
Broca-Wernicke area, a few inches at most, the eyes because of the bandwidth 
of information in the visual spectrum are at the furthest distance from 
Area 17 that they can be physically located.  Still, the biological structure of the eye-brain must invert the visual signals to compensate for how the lens of the eye introduces spectral information onto the retinal surface, then diverts the visual information to the opposite side of the brain, all in order to gain additional signal to noise separation - time and spatial filtering of useful environmental features.  The last bits of information presented during each left to right visual saccade motion occur in Area 17, the 2-D endpoint of the optical chiasmatic pathway.  
<P>
In Area 17, noise is reduced, signal is enhanced, and an exact 2-D 
topological laydown of objects from the real world are put down in a map grid of exactly 
what the eye is sensing.  Area 18 begins the conversion, using similar 
cerebral cortex structures to those found in Broca-Wernicke and other parts of the 
brain, of the 2-D information into the 3-D semiotic mental representations that then 
spread in lissajous-like dispersion patterns throughout the rest of the brain. 
<P>  
Of interest, the common biological structures found throughout the brain 
cortex result in different semiotic percepts - perceptions.  Aural information and 
aural invariants in the signals sent from ear to Broca-Wernicke result in the 
perception of sound.  The nose structures convert smell signals into the 
perceptions of smell.  And, the biological computational structures in Area 17,
common to smell and hearing structures, nonetheless convert visual information into the perception of sight.  Obviously, there is something very important happening in the filtering of afferent information from the sensory modalities to the various subtopologies of the cerebral cortex - and this filtering appears to be affine stationary 1/f removal of noise and presentation of 
signal to biologic computional structures that are presupposed to receive 
such signals.  
<P>
Basically, Area 17 is geared to receive preprocessed signals, not noise, 
to act upon with more signal processing - the semiotic process.  Based on 
the nature of the frequency and amplitude and phase structure (e.g.- pulse 
repitition rate, etc.), the common brain computational structures, common semiotic 
processes, common electromagnetic memory, common mechanical protein 
reconfiguration memory storage and recall processes, common dispersion 
patterns, and other common components in the different subtopologies of the brain 
cortex, all nonetheless receive different signal invariants to work upon, 
thus producing the different perceptions that make up mind.   
<P>
Common brain, common computational semiotic processes, act upon different signals to 
produce different perceptions.  When brain binds the different semiotic 
perceptions into high harmonic 40+ Hz patterns, the synergistic effect is 
the mental theater of mind, in particular conscious mind.  At different 
frequency levels, mind is altered, to the non-conscious Delta states at 
basic (non-harmonic) 3 to 5 Hz, the dream like and meditative states of 
Theta in the 7 to 9 Hz region, the alert wakeful states of Alpha in the 
10 to 15 Hz, and the increasing frenetic to schizophrenic states of high 
Beta arousals in the 15+ Hz regime.  
<P>
The signal from the eyes is preparing itself for the brain and the brain is presupposed by design to prepare itself for the signal.  The importance here should not be understated.  
<P>
The cerebral cortex is structured to receive useful signals by which to 
learn useful semiotic languages and patterns of usefully combined semiotic 
languages of mind.  Receptor sites are established to receive these signals.  
The more signals, the more receptor sites are established in the brain in 
an addictive fashion.  If signals do not arrive and bind, lock up, with the 
receptor sites, the receptor sites send out neurochemicals to orient the 
brain sensory modalities to provide signals.  If real signals from the 
environment are not sent to the receptor sites, then semiotic based signals 
from the mind are sent to the receptor site.  In this way, the brain feeds 
its addictive process with either real environmental signals or learned 
semiotic signals.  
<P>
When the entire brain is listening to silence or 
looking at nothing specific, but is cued to some expected event, the 
entire outer periphery of the cortex is very electroencephalograph (EEG) and positron emission  transmission (PET) active, all sensors and semiotic processes on alert.  If nothing happens, the brain over time will begin to shift from this original EEG - PET status into a different semiotic based pattern of closure.  The brain tries to complete patterns with external or internal information.  
<P>
If the environment doesn't provide a pattern, the mind will construct 
one in an attempt to enfold the event as a learned activity.  
<P>
The ability to measure learning is simple.  Monitor the cerebral cortex signal to noise information time delay during a learning cycle.   As the brain is learning, the right side is bouncing information via the corpus callosum to the left side and vice versa.  The process is time consuming in the formation of semiotic languages and takes on the order of 100 to several hundred milliseconds.  
<P>
Once learning is accomplished and the semiotic language associated with the 
learning is disseminated from the cortex into the cerebellum and efferent 
motor pathways, the timing and the orientation of the brain shifts dramatically.   
<P>
Learned pathways from the right side of the cerebellum control the right side 
of the body and the left cerebellum controls the left side of the body.  This 
shift from the bicameral mind to cerebellum based brain output results in 
efferent responses less than 100 milliseconds.  Learning left to right and 
right to left uses up precious survival time.  Learned events execute faster, 
and restore survival time.   The brain is an addictive cycle of learning to 
learn to secure precious survival response time.  
<P>
Once learning occurs in an EM field pattern or conformational change, a QSK registration takes place, establishing identification with a unique quantum code for further semiotic 
or cerebellum output actuation.  
<P>
By analogy, the afferent nervous pathway to the brain is high fidelity fiber 
optics providing a rich infusion of reduced noise, lossless signal input 
into the cortex.  The cerebral cortex takes the rich invariants (codelets) of the 
afferent system and transforms the information into 3-D semiotic alphabets, 
which form semiotic languages in the brain, which bind together to form mind.  
<P>
Continuing with the analogy, the efferent motor pathway from the cerebellum, 
while faster in execution than the afferent brain learning process, is not 
made up of high fidelity fiber optic - like material; rather, the efferent 
system is much more like cheap twisted pair copper wiring, highly error prone. 
<P>
The output of learning is to place mind and brain back into a system that 
by structural composition is error prone.  In bizarre evolutional fashion, 
the mental output of humans introduces error that necessarily causes the 
next round of addictive afferent input to resolve the error.  If humans 
were just simply such an example of a closed-loop or even double loop 
closed cybernetic system, then over time consistent patterns of behavior 
would emerge that would mark an eventual non-survival, end-game potential.  
<P>
The human brain gets out of this eventual evolutionary trap of closed loop 
cybernetics through the semiotic-based process of "Feedforward" 
anticipatory strategies.  
<P>
The ability to construct mental variations of QSK coded semiotic images 
allows humans to project into the future and learn future memories and the 
consequences of those future events, and store them away for future use. 
The QSK is important in that this is how humans can predict likely events, 
and discriminate between past real memory, dream memory, noetic memory, 
in process learning memory, and all the variations in between.  When there 
are structural problems in the instantiation of QSK or when QSK coding is 
very similar across memories, then such perceptual defaults such as deja vu, 
deja reve, arrive, pense, connu, dit, eprouve, fait, goute, lu, su, voulu, visite, 
vecu, senti, parle, pressenti, raconte, rencontre, et al can occur.  
<P>
The ability for humans to look into a 3-D semiotic future provides a 
virtual capability to alter reality, in an eolithic fashion, reconfigure 
patterns, learn the results, and then draw conclusions and the consequences 
of future action of the mind back down into the brain for execution versus 
information derived from the environment.  Such a semiotic capacity 
dictates a huge evolutionary advantage.  Humans possess the highest 
degree of fidelity Macula-Fovea to Area 17 signal extraction in the 
animal kingdom.  
<P>
In combination, the prefrontal lobes and the anterior 
cingulate, override cerebellum and other cortex downselection processes. 
They are implicated in the ability to maintain the focus of attention to 
internal mental semiotic musing of the eolithic future, versus constantly 
attending to a past induced present.  As a result, the brain-mind is freed 
to look into the future and "Feedforward" useful information to understand the past and 
prepare for the future.  
<P>
With more than fifty percent of the human neurology dedicated to 
hand-eye coordination, Area 17 and in particular left Area 17 
plays a great semiotic role in the ability of humans to make and 
reconfigure tools that can quickly dominate a planet, as opposed to the 
information capacity of other species.  
<P>
Certain nitrogen-based molecules 
introduced into the bloodstream that navigate past the blood-brain barrier 
excite the semiotic process in humans, from substances such as caffein, nicotine, 
heroin and cocaine and red meats.  Other nitrogen interacting chemicals cause a shift in 
semiotic processes and QSK coding processes of past, present and future 
memories. These chemicals are, for example, found in morphine, codeine, opium, 
alcohol and tryptophan.  The myriad numbers of receptor specific neurochemicals and hormones internally produced in the human brain, dopamine, serotonin, melatonin, adenosine, 
calpain, endorphins, acetylcholine, etc. are all fine tuning the semiotic 
processes of addictive learning and memory and error correction and 
feedforward processes of the human brain-mind.  
<P>
Not surprisingly, the primary molecules that biocomputationally combine 
to produce human mental activity are those primarily found in air and 
water interacting with carbon - crystalline H2O, and Nitrogen, 
electromagnetically resonating with protein microtubulin in the glial 
cell rich domain of the neuropil.  Neuropil synapto-dendritic regions never physically connect, thereby producing an extremely intricate 3-D biological computational structure.  
<P>
The 3-D biological computer in the protective skull casing of the human can naturally only continue to enlarge in the area directly beneath the soft spot in the skull plates of human infants.  
<P>
The area of the brain under this part of the skull is the anterior cingulate, 
implicated in the ability to focus the brain-mind on "Feedforward" semiotic 
processes.  The human infant brain sprouts neuronal clusters at an amazing, 
mostly Delta and Theta state, where upwards of 100,000 interneuronal 
connections are laid down every minute in the ninth month prenatal to several 
years of age.  The first few years of life are crucial to the structural 
capacity of the brain to carry out semiotic processes of mind later in life.  Just as the 
eyes are not engaged in a continuous process of information gathering, but are 
engaged in bursts of information gathering and interpretation, the human brain also undergoes various bursts of neuronal sprouting, consolidation and pruning throughout life.  Much of Piaget's observations about the maturation cycle of children can be linked to brain surges in interneuronal capacity.  
<P>
Since human mental output is error prone, and human infants take years to fully 
develop the structural capacity for complete semiotic functioning, there would be an evolutionary advantage for older humans to teach and help shape the error correcting potential of replacement infants.   Whereas not all older humans would have the same amount of evolutionary interest in the previous statement, infants would be at an advantage to more closely interact with 
those older humans willing to share learned semiotic knowledge.  
<P>
Because the Macula-Fovea of an infant is not quite ready to lay down a green baseline 2-D 
map into Area 17, the first sights of human infants are in the near and far 
reds of the area of the retina below the optic nerve.  
<P>
The first neurolinguistic pattern of Broca-Wernicke that an infant can induce is the enfoldment pursing of the lips into an 'M' sound to suck and draw nutrients into the mouth.  The vibration and warmth sensory modalities of the human infant are also at play.  
<P>
Given this, the proto-semiotic world of the human infant is one of more or 
less integrated hues of red, warmth, sucking, genital motion, smooth shapes and 
specific hard wired smells.  As human infants begin to focus their eyesight, 
the visual world of Area 17 fills with the meaningfulness of faces, some useful, others not useful.  Therefore, the first real complete visual interaction with human culture, as part of the environment, is when the human infant begins to develop extended semiotic processes by visual processing of human and other faces at a distance of two to six inches to two to six feet.   The ability to extract which human facial characteristics mean what, such as laughing, crying, talking, eating, yelling are all extremely important evolutionary critical feature extractions. 
<P>
The Area 17 eidetic memories are established in the human infant 
significantly before the full neurolinguistic memory functions of Broca-Wernicke.  
Therefore, Area 17 is essential to human cultural development.  
<P>
Prosopopoeia is the Greek word for the ability to call up human/other faces to derive useful 
information about the future.  Prosopopoeia emanates from Area 17 and 
Area 18, and is triggered primarily in left Area 17 as a result of the 
final information laydown of the visual saccade.  When humans want to recall faces 
and images of loved ones, such as a mother or a favorite pet, a gentle massaging or 
tapping of the area behind the left ear, closing of the eyes, and the act of rolling the eyes up 
and to the right is often sufficient to trigger the internal focus and the recall of the desired visage.  Even as certain facial images are removed from the actual field of view, there is a continuation of neuronal firing in the region of Areas 17 and 18, indicating that there is some degree of hard wiring to accomodate the immediate and prolonged processing of facial 
invariants, suggested as 'authoritative' invariants.   Such invariants are 
genetically encoded into Area 17 to alert the semiotic processes that they are 
about to receive an environmentally significant signal.  
<P>
Donchin's work in the mid-80's on P-300, and a series of other facial pattern recognition cueing 
events in the human brain, further indicated that human interaction with faces, 
prosopopoeia, is an important mental activity for survival.  Prosopopoeia also 
includes the recall of faces in dreams and other altered brain states.  
Accordingly, in the semiotic alphabet, prosopopoeia is part of both hard wired 
recognition and plastic signal processing reconfiguration in the human visual semiotic language. 
<P> 
Showing faces to humans must elicit a semiotic response.  The virtual reality 
introduction of stimuli of invariant human facial signal characteristics into 
Area 17 must also elicit a semiotic response.  Perhaps this is what occurs when 
certain invariants contained in the optical-chiasmatic pathway pass by the 
thalamus and excite the anxiety/fear complex of the amygdala, automatically 
releasing adrenaline in preparation for a 'flee-fight' cerebellum response to 
certain faces.  Or for other faces, the invariants stimulate a release of 
pleasure inducing responses.  By simply raising the right eyebrow for an extended 
moment or two, pleasure thoughts can be stimulated.  Equally, by simply 
raising the left eyebrow for an extra moment, can stimulate the semiotic 
process into feeling of sadness and memories of depression.  
<P>
Stimulation of Area 17, and in particular of left Area  17, causes 
picture-like memories to be elicited.  The triggering point in 
left Area 17 is also coupled to dream instantiation.  There is no 
noise in dreams because the dream is in the bandwidth of the memory 
that is QSK coded.  Dreams are 100% clarity.  
<P>
Simply massaging the left rear of the head and a little massage to the 
forehead can help the semiotic process of visualizing a face or memory of pictures - when 
the picture comes into internal view, the mannerisms of massage automatically 
cease.  The picture is brought forth by a common binding process across the 
brain.  An affect of the binding process, especially if disparate regions of 
the brain are involved at various geometries on different sides of the corpus 
callosum is laughter.  When semiotic information in one part of the geometry does not 
conform to the information in the other part of the geometry on the other side 
of the corpus callosum, and when the intracollasal transfer finally confirms 
that latter information from one geometry is more 'true' than prior information is 
from the other geometry, the result is "laughter" - "a sneeze of thought."  
The bigger the diverse brain coupling when truth emerges, the bigger the laugh, 
from a chuckle to a rolling, lingering, boisterous series of guffaws.
<P><BR>
<B>4.5 ANTINOMY - THE BASIC STRUCTURE OF BRAIN-MIND</B>
<P>
From the saying, "...Two heads are better than one:" - The brain is full of 'two heads' combining to make a semiotic decision.  In the prefrontal lobe, the left side sends signals 
the mind interprets as pleasure and happiness, and the entire left temporal side 
of the brain is filled with neurochemicals that make humans feel good.  The right 
frontal lobe, on the other hand, sends signals that indicate human life is sad 
and depressed.  
<P>
Every 90 to 120 minutes either the left hemisphere or the 
right hemisphere of the brain is dominating resonant brain frequency events, as 
indicated by EEG's and PET scans.  The left human nostril opens just a bit 
more to feed in a little more oxygen when the right hemisphere is dominant.  
The right nostril opens just a bit more when the left side takes over.  At 
various times during the day and in sleep, both sides of the brain slip into synchrony 
with each other and quiet, restful behavior patterns result.  Otherwise, in periods 
of asymmetrical brain activity, there are fitful tossing and turning in sleep and 
nervous mannerisms in wakeful pursuits.  
<P>
Antinomy, from the Greek word for antagonistic forces that together produce a mutually beneficial result - a positive synergy, seems to be expressed in the structure of the human brain.  
The human brain seems to use antinomy in brain structure to perform a measurement on reality.
<P>
Based on blood flow and knotty neuronal topology nutrient capture, the 
addictive left side of the human brain gets rewarded first with receptors 
locked up and pleasure feedback neurochemicals released into the left temporal 
somesthetic portion of the brain.  
<P>
However, the addictive right side of the brain receives lesser amounts of 
blood nutrients, such that the non-verbal right side of the brain, with many 
receptors unlocked releases neurochemicals indicating more external sensory stimulus, 
or more semiotic internal stimulus to satisfy addictive requirements for 
learning.  
<P>
Thus, a very interesting measurement duel is established with a knotty 3-D left biological 
computational structure, capable of expressing itself in neurolinguistic 
patterns, and full of  "feel good" chemicals like oxytocin, surging along dealing with 
reality, in conflict with a smooth 3-D right biological computational 
structure, not so fully capable of neurolinguistic expression, oozing with "feel bad" 
chemicals, making due with semiotic virtual images of reality - the 
result is pure computational antinomy, the basis of sentient computing.  
<P>
The development of the corpus callosum structurally allows both sides of the brain to communicate with each other.  But in the human species, the amount of intercollasal transfer bundling 
is subject to sexual dimorphism - in which males and females statistically 
emerge with more or less, males having on average, less bilateral symmetry 
and less efficient coupling in the intercollasal transfer mechanism.  
<P>
For every action a human makes or thought a human thinks, a dual axis, and even a three axis
scalar, computational process is actuated.  Sometimes a longer intercollasal learning is better, sometimes a shorter lopsided learning pattern is better.  In either case, the better 
result gets sent into the cerebellum for future control of the same side hemisphere.  
Actually, the basic dual antinomy computer of the cerebral cortex downloads into the 
more machine like, serial/parallel computation of the cerebellum.  The human 
actually operates with what appears to be up to a three axis computational process.  The X, Y
antinomy establishes basic measurement and the scalar axis, Z, provides additional sentient,
holonomic measurement of self.  
<P><BR>
<B>4.6  ERGODICITY AND NON-LINEAR CHAOS</B>
<P>
As the human eyes visually saccade from lower left to upper right, what is 
being observed in left occipital Area 17 is three bursts of non-linear 
behavior per second superposed on time-transient behavior, that results in ordered 
patterns that evolve in time.  The transient behavior is eliminated as the 
eyes reach the upper right portion of the visual saccade, leaving only strange 
attractors and deterministic chaos to winnow out during the chiasmatic 
pathway, for semiotic introduction to Area 17, and semiotic conversions and 
transformations in surrounding Area 18.  
<P>
Whereas most self-similar patterns are consistent, ergodically, over different scalar transformations, there are other non-linear patterns that become consistent only at different ergodic scales.  In essence, there are forms of non-linear ergodicity that evolve from 
focus at certain scalar transformations into chaos at the next transformation, 
and then back into focus at another scalar pattern.   
<P>
Semiotic differences in species could not only be related to portions of the electromagnetic spectrum undergoing cortical sensory transformation, but also in the scalar focus/chaos 
coding of patterns of sensory information.  For instance, what if Neanderthal 
and Cro-Magnon both interacted with the environment with basically the same 
brain computational functions, with Neanderthal possessing a larger overall 
cranium capacity, but the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum sensed 
by their eyes and the ergodicity self-similarity of their focus/chaos coding 
were different.  
<P>
If Cro-Magnon came out with a Macula-Fovea in the green 
spectrum, sending deterministically chaotic strange attractors signals over a 
optical chiasmatic pathway into an isomorphic left Area 17 for  2-D point to 
point connections, that would serve to feed focus coded 3-D visual semiotic 
information into Area 18 for dissemination and binding with other focus 
semiotic languages throughout the cerebral cortex, then Cro-Magnon would 
have an extremely competent evolutionary mechanism to 'Feedforward' future 
mental images of the consequences of eolithic toolmaking and 
reconfigurations of information, even if the energy and brain frequency 
requirements and information signal processing would require Cro-Magnon to 
sleep upwards of 20 minutes a day, three times a day, in a deep Delta state, 
almost completely incapable of conscious self-defense.  
<P>
If Neanderthal on the other hand, physically stronger and with a larger overall brain, came out with eyes and an optical chiasmatic pathway that registered slightly different 
electromagnetic spectrum onto an Area 17 with a focus coding more 
chaotically cloudy, then the ability for clear 3-D 'feedforward' semiotic 
mental representations and reconfigurations would be lessened, with an 
accompanying lesser evolutionary skill.  Different semiotic scalar 
transformations suggests that Cro-Magnon and Neanderthal could 
communicate with each other, even understand each other, but in cloudy 
terms and mostly with respect to the present and past, not necessarily the 
future, or in moral implications of future action.   
<P>
As implicated in Julian Jaynes, 'Origins of Consciousness of the Bicameral Mind,' perhaps the dawn of Homo Sapiens and of present day Humans, is the emergence of different mental 
coding (QSK) in the scales of focus and chaos across the ergodic 
self-similarity, deterministic chaos and strange attractors/invariance common 
in biologic computational structures.  
<P>
For all the strength and brain size and even 
burial rights of Neaderthal, perhaps shortfalls in scalar focus and 
feedforward semiotics and the ability to conduct internal future moral considerations took 
a natural evolutionary toll and prevented species continuation.  Maybe 
Neanderthal's Area  17 didn't exist, or only partially so, because of 
different blood flow and nutrient absorption coefficients in the brain.

All of these items reinforce each other and often merge in tuples and 
triplets.  Many of these topics can be considered subsets of other topics, 
which could shorten the list, and additional versions could probably be supplied, 
slightly increasing the list, but roughly the same number of visual signs and 
symbols (semiotics) exist to combine to portray and recreate reality in visual 
language as does the spoken alphabets to create a neurolinguistic 
representation and description of the world - 20 to 40 components make up 
languages, influencing and heavily influenced by cultural modifications.  
<P>
Just as we do not increase the number of sound types in our Broca-Wernicke area as 
we age, we also do not increase the number of images in our Area 17 
computations.  We may become more or less aware of our spoken and visual 
languages, but we do not structurally increase the computational components 
underlying the languages.  However, just as recombinant DNA can introduce 
more complex coding sequences into new life forms, there should be no 
reason why recombinant Semiotic coding could not emerge to give us a larger 
Broca-Wernicke or Area 17 semiotic language capacity.  
<P>
Sentient machine language could conceivably host spoken and visual semiotics that exceed the human 
electromagnetic and focus-chaos (QSK) limitations currently expressed in 
biologic computational structures, perhaps much in the same manner as 
Cro-Magnon to Neaderthal.  
<P>
Here is a sample of some of the underlying brain structure and function 
for a few of the items in the Semiotic Alphabet:  Images of Mind.  
<P>
Motion, Distance, Eyes (green and red), Size, Shadows and Prosopopeia - Faces, 
Authority receive in depth coverage in other sections.  
<P>
Lines  that appear straight cause a Macula-Fovea focus indicative of human 
activity, as opposed to the more non-linear, curvilinear activity of other species 
biological computational activity.  Non-biological processes, such as earth-chemical 
processes, can produce remarkable artifacts in nature, to include straight 
lines and geometries that otherwise would appear to be formed by human activity, 
and can fool the human visual process.  
<P>
Nonetheless, converging and diverging lines also impact Area  17 and subsequent 
Area 18 semiotic processes related to interpretation and pattern 
development.  
<P>
In the presence of alternating electromagnetic fields placed on 
the right and left temporal regions of the human brain, series of lines and 
orthogonal crosses and rotating  x-shaped patterns are perceived, to include 
associated sensations/perceptions of time elongation, to extreme situations of 
'no time' and a complete 'end of test pattern' shut down effect, where the 
person completely shuts down internal visualization and time awareness.  
<P>
That lines and patterns of lines can dramatically affect human behavior is 
indicative of a very strong semiotic basis in the transformation of lines and strings 
(String Theory) into much more complex mental visual representations.  Human soft 
wired signal processing of line patterns and associated geometries appears to 
go much farther in semiotic predictive reconfiguration of 'feedforward' future 
realities than in any other species.  In other animals, crossing lines and 
edge penetrations result in very specific hard wired behavioral responses, whereas 
in humans, it appears that semiotic manipulation of lines gives us the capacity 
to learn and test predictive locations and geometries on future patterns for QSK 
storage for future recall and application to present and past pattern 
utilization.  
<P>
Because more than 50% of human neuronal circuitry is dedicated to Hand-Eye 
coordination, humans spend a lot of quality time observing, mostly 
non-cognitively, own and others hands and eyes.  Hands and eyes are critically 
important to efficient human semiotic internal representations.  Just as the 
human tongue moves in the mouth to physcially map out neurolinguistic 
patterns in speech and word related movement, the hands and eyes also trace 
out 3-D patterns to physcially represent or physically stimulate internal 
human semiotic visual patterns.  Hand - Eye gesticulation is an efferent loop, 
showcasing what is going on internal to the mind.  
<P>
Hand - Eye gesticulation is also providing afferent error control feedback 
loop information back into the semiotic pattern testing of reality taking 
place in Area  17 and Area  18.
<P>
On earth in the presence of gravity, the human eyes are normally looking out 
and down, not up, and mostly down, not out.  Human eyes are normally looking 
down on the ground with some forward field of view.  A strong evolutionary 
reason for such a configuration of the eyes is that Area  17 should be able 
to optimize the sensory search for food and or treasure.  
<P>
Most food or treasure on earth is down and out.  The eyes are remarkably able to spot odd or novel 
or learned objects in clutter, mostly ground place clutter.  Put a twenty dollar 
bill in a dirty gutter with lots of non-valuable items and very soon a human eye will 
focus in, detect and cause a cerebellum response to pick up the money, or 
treasure or food.  
<P>
Area 17 and Area 18 in the absense of legitimate sensory input will begin to manufacture semiotic patterns that reflect survival requirements; hence, the mirage, or the hallucination of food or money, etc.  Borrowing a phrase from Field of Dreams, instead of build it and they will 
come, "...Dig a Hole, and Semiotics Will Come."
<P>
In the larger section on Antinomy, discussion indicates that the human brain 
is constantly comparing and contrasting, to include fusing diametrically opposed 
biologic computational outputs, in its internal semiotic pattern making, 
hypothesis generation, down selection and decision making deferral with 
support from the prefrontal lobes and anterior cingulate.  That the human 
brain is capable of dealing with antinomy such as Smoothness and Roughness is 
not surprising.  Human - made objects reflect a different fractal dimension of 
smoothness and roughness than naturally occuring objects.  The human 
knotty topology of the left cerebral hemisphere is intricately capable of 
discerning roughness, down to fine filagree details, whereas the smoother 
computation of the less profligate right cerebral hemisphere dovetails quiet 
efficiently with the grace and flowing patterns of longer, less complex 
patterns. 
<P>
The shifting signal processing of the human Macula - Fovea to the right and 
left occipital Areas 17 and 18 are natural extensions of fractal-wavelet 
(Gabor Function in Hilbert Space) estimators and trappers of self-similar ergodic 
invariants, strange attractors and deterministic chaotic boundaries.  In 
essence, the human brain is a smoothness - roughness calculator using the 
corpus callosum as a measurement device combining the semiotic inputs of 
left and right Areas 17 and 18.  
<P>
Again and again in the limited signal bandwidth, the precious real estate, of the 
human physical brain, the constant antinomy very often produces the following 
restrictions on human mental processing and cerebellum output.  Humans get 
into conditions of phase lock loop in which the same state cycle limits of 
semiotic representation repeat and repeat and repeat, locking out other 
biological computations.  At other times, constant noise and low threshold of 
input constantly keep the semiotic process from enfolding upon a down select 
mode, normally in a frenetic high Beta state of brain frequency, in which the 
molecular resonance in the brain is excessive, most likely in the nitrogen 
frequency regime, thus producing a hectic, confused semiotic initiation 
sequence.  
<P>
Under normal mental conditions, the human brain seems most 
adept at starting with one end of the continuum of the semiotic antinomy process, such 
as smooth right hemispheric hand - eye drawing and carefully, precisely 
shifting to a controlled, detailed left hemispheric concentration, and then shifting 
scalar processes back again.  
<P>
For instance it is very easy to use both hands to trace 
out detailed or smooth drawings, but much more difficult to assign semiotic 
bandwidth control to draw smooth with one hand and detailed with the other, 
without substantial training and practice.  
<P>
The human brain would appear to be a measurement device between the opposite ends of an antinomy continuum, with a very high degree of precision in picking the intermediate invariants 
which depict reality, and then sending such invariants into semiotic 3-D mental 
transformations and feedforward pattern reconfigurations and test for 
potential use in human survival.
<P>
When the human eye - semiotic process is presented with large numbers of 
objects, semiotic processes begin to cluster and associate very quickly above 
numbers 10 to 20.  Perhaps because the optic nerve is structured in such a 
way that the only two distances of optimal concern to Area  17 include 30 
miles out to infinity and 2 inches to 6 feet, the brain processes are themselves 
optimized to deal with the likely numbers of objects in the field of view at 
these two distances.  Accordingly, probably no more than 10 to 20 objects will 
populate at two inches, while extremely large numbers, such as myriad stars in 
a clear night sky will predominate the human field of view.
Given that clustering and grouping are efficient forms of energy conversion, the Human Eye - Area 17/18 Semiotic complex probably deals with two sets of optimal numbers, small numbers and 
large number sets.  Evidence of this is seen in asking people to recount how 
many objects they witnessed, which normally results in either an accurate 
number of recounted objects when the actual count falls below 10 to 20, or 
mistaken counting on the low side when numbers of objects greater than 20 
begin to form into larger multiple sets of 50, or another form of mistaken 
counting where the recounted objects are much higher than the actual number 
of objects, such as claiming thousands when there where only hundreds.
<P>
The semiotics of survival is a most important area for representation and 
feedforward reconfiguration of Areas 17 and 18.  The internal visualizations 
and forward consequences of Sex, and Temperature, and Death - God - 
Authority, and Fire, and Water, and Blood-Meat would contain tremendous 
implications for internal testing of the virtual, dreamlike, feedforward world 
of semiotics versus the learned, sighted observations of reality.  
<P>
Children below the ages of three do not seem to possess a semiotic binding 
sense of the true significance of death, but they do seem to instinctively sense authority, as 
suggested in the section on prosopopoeia and some forms of authoritarian 
facial hard wiring associated in amygdala - cerebellum response to invariants 
in the information content flowing through the optical chiasmatic pathway.  
<P>
Children's sense and perceptions of Life-Death-Morality-God-Authority seem 
to semiotically bind for the first time between the ages of 3 and 7, as Piaget 
would suggest, and again very closely related to recall functions of 
prosopopoeia.  Patients interviewed after near death experiences repeatedly 
refer to seeing the faces of their loved ones, mothers and fathers, 
grandparents, at an age in life, and most often from the perspective from the 
waist up, as if from the early semiotic fusion memorys (QSK) as a child 
between the ages of 3 to 7.  When the anterior cingulate is probed 
mechanically, human subjects also without exception, refer to elicited 
memories associated with love and morality and god and kindly authority 
figures and faces, suggesting that there are trigger spots in the Central 
Nervous System (CNS) for the elucidation of electromagnetic resonance 
memory (Sheldrake - 85) or mechanical protein consolidation (Eccles - 92), 
that are most likely disseminated via holonomic self-similar patterns throughout 
the brain/CNS field boundaries.  People with brain frequencies entrained at 10 Hz 
frequencies also make many similar claims, to include the Pink or White Like 
sense of motion into and following a tunnel.  Phosphene effects of externally 
induced flicker fusion and/or semiotic induced brain states may account for 
these experiences, but that they are part of human consciousness is 
important, because such powerful sensations/perceptions affect the potential 
survival role of the individual/culture, and should not be dismissed as 
extraneous brain/mind artifacts.  Tunnels and faces and soothing white light 
may represent the most basic feedforward human semiotic condition, essential 
to our very sentient being - our initial semiotic binding, the semiotic 
trilogy of life. 
<P>
Water and stillness also seem to capture human semiotic attention, causing a 
deferment over other mental activities.  Fire and the Waving of a Flag and the 
internal vibration and rhythms associated with actual or semiotic Sex also 
appear to be major semiotic 'symbols of symbols,' from which other subordinate 
mental activities arise.  
<P>
Temperature is important to humans and the fact that a 
shadow can convey information to Areas  17/18 of a semiotic location that 
means the difference between cooler life and overheated extinction is also a 
powerful semiotic symbol of symbols.  
<P>
Returning to the theme of the brain as a measurement device between two ends of a semiotic continuum, in the domain from Clear to Fuzzy visual information, with specific Odd or Inverted 
or Reversed/Rotated Invariants, the semiotic discontinuities captured by the 
sensory input process to the brain appears to force the brain to produce a 
reason, to force a down select resolution of the semiotic problem, to 
deconflict the situation.  Importantly, if sufficient noise is also entering the semiotic 
pathways from external or internal (prefrontal-anterior cingulate), 
(amygdala-cerebellum) sources, such that down selection can not occur, the 
brain could continue, non-cognitively, below just noticeable differences (jnd) 
at the sensation-perceptual interface threshold, to churn away semiotically, firing 
away unsuccessful pattern after unsuccessful pattern, thus tying up critical 
pattern recognition resources, in a non-conscious, yet still adaptive, open 
ended feedforward loop, with no effective survival closure and useful 
learning achieved.  
<P>
In such a run away semiotic condition, there is great pattern development, but 
no practical survival implementation of the pattern.
<P>
Noise, the necessary explosion in the mind to break the previous symmetry lock 
and to induce a new set of semiotic options can be triggered in various ways.  
<P>
From the saying, "...Eyes - windows to the soul:" - Research at the University of Washington, St. 
Louis would suggest that information passing through the anterior cingulate 
triggers in humans thoughts and feelings of soul - of connectedness to 
nature/universe.  Information through the amygdala, nearby, arouses 
concerns, anxiety and fear.  Information through the nucleus accumbens 
stimulates actions related to sexual impulses.  Information through the 
hippocampal region elicits ranges of common and specific, often unrecalled 
memories, including rage - almost as if  'Cross-Talk' emerges when information 
signals in one area of the brain cross over and stimulate, entrain nearby 
areas.
<P>
Such binding action is also triggered and mediated from pre-frontal lobe 
neuronal firing patterns - with coherence through the entoerhinal areas.  
Importantly, only in humans do these brain substructures, in this structural geometry, 
exist.  Importantly, only in humans do these structures, these neuronal 
subtopologies, operate within the nitrogen-molecule based neurotransmitter 
breakdown cycles.  Importantly, human-like concepts of soul, right and wrong 
morality, ethics which appear to emmanate from the anterior cingulate region, 
can be biochemically superstimulated and eventually shunted by introduction 
of nitrogen laden chemicals such as nicotine, cocaine, caffein, morphine, 
heroin, etc., and probably from electromagnetic equivalents that can 
specifically stimulate brain nitrogen resonant frequencies.  
<P>
The changes in oxygen-nitrogen levels associated with alcohol intoxication and reduced 
oxygen blood levels from other intoxicants modifies information flow through the anterior cingulate.  When the anterior cingulate regulation of brain processes drops off line, then the 
other stimulated areas of memory and semotic cortex/CNS, e.g. rage, sexual 
impulse, fear, animal-like sensory/perception modalities become established as 
dominant over human behavior.  The learned patterns of response in the 
cerebellum directly feed into the efferent nervous pathways and 'automaton - 
like' behavior takes place.  Such processes can account for 'drug-induced' 
learning without volitional cognition, such as why an intoxicated person can 
still perform relatively complex activities equivalent to driving a car - without 
cognizant memory of the activity.  
<P>
Voltaire, the prolific French writer is said to have consumed tens of cups of coffee to enter his frenzied state of capturing his internal word thoughts, estimated at 700 word thoughts per minute.  Writing with both his right and left hands and dictating as well to a scribe, he kept 
up with his word thoughts.  
<P>
He loved these sublime moments - pure '100% in the bandwidth' efferent neurolinguistic speech - whereas most humans engage in a stuttering neurolinguistic deselection process - choosing only 60 or so words per minute from 700 available.  
<P>
The human semiotic thought/learning process appears to be addictive, once we start to do it, we do it all our lives.  When we speak we are predisposed to hear, and when we hear we are predisposed to talk.  Such oscillation of the Fibonacci - based coding sequence of the inner 
ear, the cochlea, is much the same coding sequence (QSK) of the nautilus and 
the basis of the floor plan of the Acropolis, the Greek Temple of Learning in 
Athens - nitrogen encryption/unlocking sequences that start the stimulation of 
the production of adenosine receptor sites in the brain.  When we think and 
talk, adenosine is not present at the receptor sites.  As we tire through the 
day and these sites need to replenish, adenosine from a gland at the back of the 
neck is released that locks up these sites, making them unavailable to us.  
When we drink coffee and ingest/interact with other nitrogen stimulating 
biochemicals/electromagnetic fields, our adaptive brain puts out new 
adenosine receptor sites.  More receptor sites require more adenosine, which 
can only be produced at certain rates, therefore our brains get into a 
withdrawl situation where we can't shut off the thinking process.  Rather than more 
thoughts being better quality, the net effect is run away less optimal 
learning thought processes.  Falling asleep and dreaming in Theta is where some of the 
receptor sites are still open and partial direct channels of semiotic 
condition can occur, but in dreamlike, disconnected patterns.  It appears that humans 
must undergo a full Delta state of very low frequency resonance to restore the 
normal learning addictive state, which can be quickly stimulated by nitrogen 
resonating sources.  If Delta states and other restorative frequencies are not 
allowed to occur in humans, then a chronic, under efficient semiotic state is 
engendered.  Just as run away suboptimal Broca-Wernicke word thought 
addictions can occur, it should also be possible to describe Imagery-Based 
Addiction, such as Pornography, in Areas 17-18.
<P>
Hopefully, the description of the Semiotic Alphabet:  Images of Mind  
establishes that humans and human cultures clearly are extremely dependent 
on the 2-D transformation of visual sensory information from the eyes to Areas 
17-18 internal 3-D semiotic representation for a feedforward test of reality 
in the human condition.  Without this capacity, in conjunction with binding to 
Broca-Wernicke and other areas of the brain, we would not be human.  
Importantly, this capacity is subject to modification both internally and via 
external sources.  Equally, this capacity of the brain is not necessarily 
fixed and can be extended, augmented or transferred to machine based sentient 
computing requirements of the 21st Century.
<P><BR>
<B>4.7  BRANCHING TREES - THE SIGN OF BRAIN</B>
<P>
The image of a broad, branching oak tree is a fitting semiotic sign for the wonderful complexity of the brain-mind, emerging out of less complex, yet self-similar, common structural 
components.  Just as the eyes, as windows to the soul, feed the rich spectrum 
of colors into the brain to paint and massage the human condition, the branching tree 
represents how the brain draws upon, feeds and breathes out information 
anew.  Much like a colorful coral reef, the tree-like brain is immersed in a 
sphere of information. The brain extracts and then enfolds selected 
information into new patterns to test and alter the world.  
<P>
Just as trees rise from the ground to follow the sun, the brain rises up 
following the direction of tiny pieces of magnetite in special cells and areas of the 
brain to seek out important information from earth's electromagnetic fields.  Just 
as trees sprout new fractal segments in search of nutrients, the brain sprouts 
self-similar bits of itself in the search for new information combinations.   
Trees begin to consolidate their growth patterns and focus in on fruitful sources of 
water and sunlight.  The brain also consolidates and reinforces those neuronal 
regions, those neuropil locations, that provide the most useful real world or 
internally semiotic generated information.  And the brain, as in trees, enters 
stages of pruning, regeneration, and the eventual stage of final pruning - 
natural down selection.  
<P>
The insides of trees are full of long strings of plastic material that help a 
tree reconfigure itself to the vagaries of natural events.  The insides of brains 
are full of long strings of plastic protein microtubulins that help a brain not 
only reconfigure itself based on extracted signals from the environment, but can 
out do a tree, in the sentient, eolithic ability to feedforward, assess, test 
and learn about the future, semiotically, in order to reconfigure itself to better 
extract and enfold upon information from the environment.  
<P>
Trees consist of the elements of nature.  The human brain thinks as the result 
of the correct assemblage of cells containing bound water in crytalline form, some slightly 
acidic, some slightly base, and the resonating frequency of nitrogen in a 
carbon-hydrogen lattice.  Just as trees stand alone and in forests, human 
brains also stand alone and in cultures sharing common mental activities - 
human brain subtopologies bind into purposeful cohesive patterns of 
attention and focus.  Human cultures bind into purposeful patterns of behavior.  
<P>
Trees however do not engage in active cognitive antinomy, they do not 
measure themselves against themselves or against other trees beyond the 
struggle for imposed cybernetic and mathematical control and use of 
resources in natural selection.   Humans are different than trees in that 
humans can turn on the antinomy, humans can observe their own mental 
states and those of others and make constant cognitive, and, most of the time, 
non-cognitive measurements of the holonomic, semiotic processes of the brain.  
<P>
The brain, the coral reef of humans, is full of rich colors that reflect the 
tremendous variety of signals upon which we can extract and shape our future. 
The tree is the land based version of the coral reef, the arboreal home for 
the eventual sprouting, consolidation, pruning - the semiotic interlocution - of 
the human brain, engaged in biologic sentient pursuits.  
<P>
Just as the coral reef saw the emergence of the trees on land, and trees saw 
the emergence of man upon the world, man is now at the juncture, the era, 
where semiotic processes will at first link up with machine intelligence in 
mutual augmentation.  Then next, set free, emulated quantum-biologic-sentient
forces can pursue totally new vistas of information reconfiguration - new patterns
of life.

                    dispersion via lissajous-like dissemination patterns                
                    throughout the CNS

Striatum - brain structure near the basal ganglia related to biological timing 
           processes

Lissajous - conversion of a stream of information into a dispersed, but        
            tractable, pattern

Ergodic -   self-similar in that any portion of the whole represents 
            significantly the entire whole

Invariants - something which is seen to be the same from different             
             observations

Semiotics - the science of signs and symbols capable of representing,          
            reconfiguring and recalling simple and complex groupings of            
            ergodic, invariant elements

Gabor Functions in Hilbert Space -

   a mathematical representation of specific information/signal processing 
   indicative of what appears to occur in the human brain during semiotic - 
   sentient activity, related closely with Shannon's Law and a family of 
   self-similar transformations, such as Fractals, Wavelets, and Codelets 

Sentient - containing the power of perception from the senses, but includes  
           also cognitive and non-cognitive sensation/perception, and the
           ability to semiotically, eolithically, rearrange information for                   
           feedforward, open loop, future predictive test and learning

Eolithic - teleological use of, formation and reconfiguration of tools

Teleology - purposeful behavior related to goals  

Holonomic - the brain as a measurement of the entire/whole sentient being

Epiphenomenon - that which emerges out of existing phenomenon

Prosopopoeia - personification of inanimate things, the recall of faces

Metempsychosis - the transmigration of the soul into another animal or human

S:N - signal to noise ratio, where semiotic processes, such as dreams, remove  
      all noise, providing recall in the bandwidth of pure signals

MT - microtubulin, where the majority of human brain microtubulin is form 1013,
     in which the 10 portion interacts with electric portions of electromagnetic
     fields (EMF), and the 13 portion interacts with the magnetic component of
     EMF's.

CNS - central nervous system

QSK - quantum shift key, suggested as the cryptologic encoding/decoding
      process occurring during orchestrated reduction (OR) of quantum
      entanglement in the MT at the neuropil during sentient activity

ZPE - zero point energy, (casimir effect), suggested as the initial energy 
      trigger from the natural environment to begin OR in the MT at the 
      neuropil

PET - positron emission tomography, provides real time non-invasive 
      monitoring of brain function

EEG - electroencephalogram, measures electrical activity in the brain

1/f - 1 over the frequency

Hz - hertz, cycles per second

OR - orchestrated reduction is a quantum wave collapse in which quantum        
     selection, rejection or deferral occurs in the MT of the neuropil

Brain States -  Beta (15 - 50+ Hz), very active to manic to schizophrenic
                         Alpha (9/10 - 15 Hz), wakeful, alert, composed
                         Theta (5/6 - 9/10 Hz), dreaming, meditative
                         Delta (1 - 5 Hz), Deeply asleep, highly non-cognitive

      Delta states occurs roughly three time per day for twenty minute periods.  
      Most of the human condition occurs in Alpha and Theta states.  Beta states 
      can rapidly deplete mental energies/neurochemical nutrients.
