					<description><![CDATA[The month of April was a blast. I admit sometimes I don&#039;t want wright anything but somehow I pulled through and completed all the 30 days. I&#039;d really wish that you would continue hosting these types of events in the future also. Like, you can pick a week and a theme for that week and everyone has to write around that theme? 
Keeping all that aside, I really liked this event and I got to read other blogs too and got to see how people approach different topics! It was very fun writing for this community!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I enjoyed the Discover prompts very much. I used them as writing warm-ups and, although I didn&#039;t share my own writing results, I did share the concept of Discover Prompts on my blog along with a link, of course, in order to spread the word. 

The only change I might make would be to suggest that participants don&#039;t have to share all  their writing responses or that they could present a &#039;best of&#039; collection at the end of the month or for each week...

As for the cadence, daily would be my ideal - for a week or a month - spread at regular intervals over the year -maybe seasonally themed or just random.

Whatever you do - thanks for this most recent Prompt month and all the best.]]></description>
