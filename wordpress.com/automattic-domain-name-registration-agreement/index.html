				<h2>Automattic Domain Name Registration&nbsp;Agreement</h2>
			</div>
			<div class="entrytext">
				<p><strong>1. Binding Agreement.</strong><span style="font-weight:400;"><strong> </strong>This is a binding agreement (“Agreement”) between Automattic Inc. (“we,” “us,” “Automattic”), which provides domain name registration services (“Services”) and the person or entity registering a domain name(s) through Automattic, your agents, or anyone using the account on your behalf (&#8220;Registrant,&#8221; &#8220;you&#8221;). Any reference to &#8220;Registry&#8221; or &#8220;Registry Operator&#8221; shall refer to the registry administrator of the applicable top-level domain (&#8220;TLD&#8221;). </span><span style="font-weight:400;">Your use of any domain name you register with us is subject to this Agreement,</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> the policies of The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (“</span><span style="font-weight:400;">ICANN”), and the <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/registry-policies/">policies of the respective Registry</a> for the domains you register (collectively, the “Terms”)</span><span style="font-weight:400;">. If you do not accept these Terms or are not of legal age to enter into this Agreement, you are not authorized to use our Services. </span></p>
<p><strong>2. Domain Name Registration.</strong> Domain name registrations are for a limited term, until the expiration date. A domain name will be deemed active when the relevant Registry accepts your application and activates your domain name registration or renewal. We cannot guarantee that you will obtain a desired domain name, even if an inquiry indicates that a domain name is available at the time of application. We are not responsible for any inaccuracies or errors in the domain name registration or renewal process.</p>
<p><b>3. Required Domain Name Registration Information.</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> As part of the domain name registration process and in accordance with ICANN policies, you are required to submit complete and accurate information, including the following (collectively, the “Registration Information”):</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight:400;">The domain name requested;</li>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Your name, postal address, email address, telephone number, and where available, fax number;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Administrative contact information, including the name, postal address, email address, telephone number, and where available, fax number of the administrative contact for the domain name; </span></li>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Technical contact information, including the name, postal address, email address, telephone number, and where available, fax number of the technical contact for the domain name; </span></li>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">Billing contact information, including the name, postal address, email address, voice telephone number, and where available, fax number of the billing contact for the domain name; and</span></li>
<li style="font-weight:400;"><span style="font-weight:400;">The names of the primary and secondary nameserver(s).</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that in most cases, the contact information you provide as part of our domain registration process will be used as your administrative contact, technical contact, and billing contact. This contact information can be updated at any time, as described <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/update-contact-information/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>
<p>In some cases, the Registration Information may differ from the WordPress.com account holder&#8217;s information. When that is the case, we consider the administrative contact in the domain&#8217;s WHOIS records (the contact information provided on WordPress.com as part of your Registration Information) to be the owner of the domain, with full authority to manage the domain.</p>
<p>You represent that you have obtained consent from any third party individuals whose personal data you have provided as Registration Information, and have notified the third party of the required disclosures and obtained the third party’s consent to such disclosure.</p>
<p>Failure to supply accurate and complete Registration Information will constitute a material breach of this Agreement and may result in the cancellation of your domain name registration.</p>
<p><b>4. Information Updating and Accuracy.</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> As a condition to the continued registration of your domain name, you must provide us with updated Registration Information within seven (7) days of any changes to such information. </span><span style="font-weight:400;">If you willfully provide inaccurate information or fail to update your Registration Information within seven (7) days of any change, then you will be in material breach of this Agreement and we may in our sole discretion cancel your domain registration. Your failure to respond within fifteen (15) days to any inquiry of ours concerning the accuracy of your Registration Information, or to contact us immediately upon discovery of any willful inaccuracy associated with your domain name registration, shall also constitute a material breach of this Agreement and may result in the cancellation of your domain name registration.</span></p>
<p><b>5. Privacy Protection.</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> Some of your</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> Registration Information will automatically be made public via WHOIS records, unless you enable Privacy Protection.

Account Security.</strong> When you create an account for any of our Services, you agree to provide us with complete and accurate information, and to keep your account information current. You are responsible for keeping your account secure and for any activity that occurs on your account. Please notify Automattic of any unauthorized uses of your account or any other breaches of security. Automattic is not responsible or liable for your acts or omissions.</p>
<p><b>7. Personal Data.</b> <span style="font-weight:400;">We will take reasonable precautions to protect your personal data from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration, or destruction.</span><span style="font-weight:400;"> Further, we will use your personal data to provide domain name registration services and support, monitor and protect the security of our services, detect and prevent fraudulent transactions and other abuse, assist with marketing and advertising efforts (for example, to monitor and analyze trends or to contact you about promotional offers), and as otherwise outlined in our <a href="http://automattic.com/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a>. You hereby consent to having your personal data used and shared with Registry Operators and trusted third parties for these purposes. Please see our <a href="http://automattic.com/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a> for additional information regarding our data handling practices.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">You agree and acknowledge that we will make available your Registration Information, in whole or in part, to ICANN, to the applicable Registry Operators, and to other third parties, including law enforcement, as applicable laws may require or permit. Additionally, a</span>s required by ICANN, this information must be made publicly available in WHOIS records. The Registry Operator also may be required to make this information publicly available in WHOIS records. Both Automattic and the Registry Operator may be required to archive this information with a third-party escrow service.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Additionally, you acknowledge and agree that ICANN may establish guidelines, limits, and/or requirements that relate to the amount and type of information that we may or must make available to </span><span style="font-weight:400;">the public or to private entities, and the manner in which such information is made available.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">Further, you hereby consent to any and all such disclosures and use of, and guidelines, limits, and restrictions on disclosure or use of, information provided by you in connection with the registration of a domain name (including any updates to such information), whether during or after the term of your registration of the domain name. Moreover, you hereby irrevocably waive any and all claims and causes of action that may arise from such disclosure or use of your Registration Information. </span></p>
<p>We will not process Registrant&#8217;s information in a way that is incompatible with the purposes outlined in this agreement.</p>
<p><b>8. Domain Name Expiration.</b> If you do not renew your domain name registration on time, it will expire and become inaccessible to you. In the event that you fail to renew the domain name in a timely fashion, the registration will expire and we may, at our discretion, elect to assume the registration and may hold it in our account, delete it, or sell it to a third party. You acknowledge and agree that your right and interest in a domain name ceases upon its expiration. You are solely responsible for renewing its registration in a timely manner.</p>
<p>It may be possible to reclaim your domain name registration for an additional fee after it has expired, but there is no guarantee that it will still be available.</p>
<p><strong>9. Variable Pricing.</strong> You understand that fees for domain registrations and renewals may vary. This means that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Domains in different TLDs (for example, .blog vs. .com) may be priced differently;</li>
<li>Domains in the same TLD may be priced differently (for example, premium domain names may cost more to register and/or renew than other domains in that TLD); and</li>
<li>The renewal fee for a domain may differ from the registration fee for that same domain.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>10. Payment &amp; Automatic Renewals.</b> Timely payment of fees is a precondition to your domain name registration. All fees are non-refundable, unless expressly noted, even if your domain name registration is suspended, cancelled, or transferred prior to the end of your current registration term. You are required to provide us with accurate and current payment information in order to process your domain name registration.</p>
<p class="important">To prevent you from losing your domain name registration, automatic renewal is enabled on all registrations with current payment information. You authorize us to collect the then-applicable annual registration fee (as well as any taxes that we have the legal obligation to collect or pay) using any credit card or other payment mechanism we have on record for you. We may collect fees one month before the end of the registration period to allow for time to address any potential billing issues. You can turn off automatic renewal for your domain name registration or plan by choosing the option to cancel.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">If we are unable to collect all fees through your selected payment method or if we receive notification of a chargeback, reversal, or payment dispute, or are charged any penalty for a fee for your Service, we may, without notice, cancel your Service and/or pursue all available remedies to obtain payment for fees and additional fees incurred.</span></p>
<p><b>11. Domain Name Transfers and Cancellations. </b>You agree that prior to transferring ownership of the domain name to another person (the “Transferee”) you shall require the Transferee to agree, in writing, to be bound by all the terms and conditions of this Agreement. If the Transferee fails to be bound in a reasonable fashion (as determined by Automattic in its sole discretion) to the terms and conditions in this Agreement, any such transfer will be null and void. Registrant and Transferee both authorize Automattic to act as their <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/designated-agent/">Designated Agent</a> to approve a Change of Registrant on their behalf, as stipulated by <a href="https://href.li/?https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/transfer-policy-2016-06-01-en">ICANN’s Transfer Policy</a>.</p>
<p>Please be aware that once you cancel your domain name registration there is no guarantee that you will be able to register it elsewhere. If you wish to transfer your domain name registration to another registrar, do not cancel your registration. Note that you can only transfer a domain name after the <a href="https://href.li/?https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/name-holder-faqs-2012-02-25-en">mandatory 60 day waiting period</a> required by ICANN, and your transfer will be governed by ICANN’s Transfer Policy.</p>
<p><b>12. ICANN Required Disclosures. </b><b></b><span style="font-weight:400;">A summary of your rights and responsibilities as a domain name registrant under ICANN’s 2013 Registrar Accreditation Agreement can be found </span><a href="http://www.icann.org/en/resources/registrars/registrant-rights/benefits"><span style="font-weight:400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight:400;">.

<p><b>13. Licensing.</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> If you license the use of the domain name registered to you to a third party, you nonetheless remain the domain name Registrant, and remain responsible for strict compliance with this Agreement, including but not limited to payment obligations, and providing and updating accurate Registration Information. Further, you accept liability for any actions of the licensee using the domain name unless you disclose the current contact information provided to you by the licensee and the identity of the licensee to any party providing reasonable evidence of actual harm within seven (7) days.</span></p>

</ul>
<p><strong>17. Breach.</strong> You agree that failure to abide by any provision of this Agreement, any ICANN, Registry, URDP or dispute operating rule or policy, may be considered a material breach, and that Automattic may provide written notice, describing the breach, to you. If you fail to provide evidence (reasonably satisfactory to Automattic) that you have not breached your obligations under this Agreement within fifteen (15) calendar days of the date of such notice, we may delete the domain name registration. Any such breach by Registrant shall not be deemed to be excused simply because Automattic did not act earlier in response to any breach by Registrant.</p>
<p><strong>18. Right to Suspend or Disable.</strong> We shall have the right, at our sole discretion and without liability to you, to suspend or cancel your domain name, or to restrict or suspend your account and/or ability to register domain names, in but not limited to, the following circumstances:</p>

<li>To avoid financial loss and any liability, civil or criminal.</li>
</ul>
<p>Automattic may terminate your access to all or any part of our Services at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice, effective immediately.</p>
<p><b>19. Your Representations. </b><span style="font-weight:400;">You represent and warrant that to the best of your knowledge and belief, neither the registration of the domain name nor the manner in which it is directly or indirectly used infringes the legal rights of any third party or is illegal in any way. This means that the domain name is not being registered for use in a way that would violate the legal rights of others, for example, by registering a domain name that violates a trademark or copyright owned by someone other than you.</span></p>
<p><b>20. Correction of Mistakes, Dispute Resolution.</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> You agree that your domain name registration shall be subject to suspension, cancellation, or transfer pursuant to any ICANN Specification or Policy, or pursuant to any Automattic or Registry Operator policy not inconsistent with any ICANN Specification or Policy, to correct mistakes by Automattic or the Registry Operator in registering the name, or for the resolution of disputes concerning the domain name. You further agree to be bound by the domain name dispute resolution policy (&#8220;Dispute Policy&#8221;) applicable to the domain name that you have selected, including ICANN’s Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (&#8220;UDRP&#8221;), which can be found <a href="http://www.icann.org/en/help/dndr/udrp">here</a></span><span style="font-weight:400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">In the event a domain name dispute arises between you and any third party, you will indemnify and hold Automattic harmless pursuant to the terms and conditions contained in the applicable Dispute Policy. For the adjudication of disputes concerning or arising from use of the domain name, the Registrant agrees to submit, without prejudice to other potentially applicable jurisdictions, to the jurisdiction of the courts (1) of the Registrant&#8217;s domicile, (2) where Automattic is located, and (3) where the Registry operator is located (for example, the UK for .uk).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:400;">The Dispute Policy may be modified at any time by ICANN (or an applicable Registry Operator), and the continued registration of your domain name with Automattic after any such Dispute Policy modification shall constitute your acceptance of the modified Dispute Policy and this Agreement. If you do not agree to any of such changes, you may request that your domain name registration be cancelled or transferred to a different registrar.</span></p>
<p><strong>21. Notices. </strong>Any notice, direction or other communication given under this Agreement shall be in writing and given by sending it via email or via regular mail. In the case of email, valid notice shall only have been deemed to be given when an electronic confirmation of delivery has been obtained by the sender. Email notification to Automattic must be sent to <a href="mailto:registrar@automattic.com">registrar[at]automattic.com</a>. Any notice to Registrant will be sent to the administrative contact email address provided by Registrant in the WHOIS record. Any email communication shall be deemed to have been validly and effectively given on the date of such communication, if such date is a business day and such delivery was made prior to 4:00 p.m. EST, otherwise it will be deemed to have been delivered on the next business day. In the case of regular mail notice, valid notice shall be deemed to have been validly and effectively given five (5) business days after the date of mailing postal notices to Automattic at:</p>

<p class="important"><strong>22. Disclaimer of Warranties.</strong> Except for the express warranties in this Agreement, Automattic does not make any other warranty of any kind, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including warranties or merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. Automattic is not responsible or liable for the deletion of or failure to store any content and other communications maintained or transmitted through the use of the domain name registration service. Automattic does not warrant that the domain name registrations service will be error free or uninterrupted. The domain name registration service is not intended for high risk activities.</p>
<p class="important"><strong>23. Limitation of Liability.</strong> Registrant agrees that Automattic’s entire liability, and Registrant’s exclusive remedy, with respect to the domain registration service provided under this Agreement and any breach of this Agreement is solely limited to the amount Registrant paid for the initial registration of the domain name. Automattic, ICANN, and the applicable Registry shall not be liable for any lost profits, revenues, or data, financial losses or indirect, special, consequential, exemplary, or punitive damages. Because some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in such states, liability is limited to the extent permitted by law.</p>
<p><strong>24. No Guarantee.</strong> You acknowledge that registration of a chosen domain name does not confer immunity from objection to the registration, reservation, or use of the domain name.</p>
<p><b>25. Indemnification.</b> <span style="font-weight:400;">You shall indemnify and hold harmless Automattic and/or the relevant Registry Operator, and its directors, officers, employees, agents, affiliates, and contractors from and against any and all claims, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) arising out of or related to your domain name registration and use. </span></p>
<p><strong>26. Force Majeure.</strong> Registrant acknowledges and agrees that neither Automattic nor the applicable Registry shall be responsible for any failures or delays in performing the respective obligations hereunder arising from any cause beyond its reasonable control, including but not limited to, acts of God, acts of civil or military authority, fires, wars, riots, earthquakes, storms, typhoons and floods.</p>
<p><strong>27. No Third Party Beneficiaries.</strong> This Agreement shall not be construed to create any obligation by either Automattic or Registrant to any non-party to this Agreement. Enforcement of this Agreement, including any provisions incorporated by reference, is a matter solely for the parties to this Agreement.</p>
<p><b></b><strong>28. Governing Law</strong>. Except to the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise, this Agreement, any access to or use of our Services will be governed by the laws of the state of California, U.S.A., excluding its conflict of law provisions, and the proper venue for any disputes arising out of or relating to any of the same will be the state and federal courts located in San Francisco County, California.</p>
<p><strong>29. No Class Actions.</strong> You may resolve disputes with us only on an individual basis; you may not bring a claim as a plaintiff or a class member in a class, consolidated, or representative action. Class arbitrations, class actions, private attorney general actions, and consolidation with other arbitrations are not permitted.</p>
<p><b>30. Updates to this Agreement.</b> We reserve the right to update this Agreement from time to time to reflect new changes, policies, and restrictions on domain name registrations as determined by us, and/or as required by ICANN or any Registry Operators. If we make material changes, we will let you know by, for example, posting a notice in your account or on our site, or by sending you an email or other communication before the changes take effect. The notice will designate a reasonable period of time after which the new Terms will take effect. If you do not agree to the new Terms, then you must stop using our Services within the designated notice period, otherwise your continued use of our Services will constitute your acceptance of any updated Terms and will be subject to the new Terms going forward.</p>
<p>If you do not agree to any change, you may request that your domain name be cancelled or transferred to a different registrar, and agree that such cancellation or transfer will be your exclusive remedy if you do not wish to abide by any change to this Agreement, or any other related and/or applicable agreement.</p>
<p><strong>31. </strong><b>Term of Agreement and Survival.</b><span style="font-weight:400;"> This Agreement takes effect from the date you register a domain name via Automattic, for as long as you maintain that registration with us. All provisions of these Terms which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity, and limitations of liability.</span></p>
<p><strong>32. </strong><span class="s1"><strong>Other Agreements and Policies</strong>. In the event that this Agreement may be inconsistent with any term, condition, policy or procedure of an applicable Registry, the term, condition, policy or procedure of the applicable Registry shall prevail. In all other cases, the terms of this Agreement govern.</span></p>
