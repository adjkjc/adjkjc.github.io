					<description><![CDATA[In attempting to do so now, I realize how hard it is to try and convey my beliefs and the experiences they stem from. I have never done so before. My current belief is this: there is a supreme being, and he has natural psychic abilities including that of time travel. However, I do not believe I have been dealing with this being but with a subgroup beneath him in hierarchy.In my case, with women from the future who have acquired psychic capabilities. They have targeted me to try and change their pasts/futures, as I slept with all of them but did not choose only or any one of them. Some of these women from the future showed themselves to me in the present time. If I knew a woman of the present who was in her twenties, on one day I would see her thirties self at the subway station, and on another day see her fourties self in the neighborhood whilst walking home. Some I even saw with children, begotten between us. But those were extremely rare occurences, and I regret not approaching them when they happened. Initially, I thought all this was being done via technological means, but I have come to the conclusion that external  technology has its limit, and everything which you have described is being done via internal technology - or natural ability.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the comment, I&#039;d love to hear more.  I, like you, went through a period of changing beliefs, based on both experience and what I believe to be intentional control via remote neural modulation.  I &#034;think&#034; that my conclusions are the most accurate I could come to given the series of experiences I have had, though there are certainly other possibilities.  I&#039;m curious to hear your beliefs, and the reasons if you care to share them.Please do read the past posts, I hope you enjoy them.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I do not know that I agree with your conclusions about the entity, but I can relate to your experiences which you articulate quite eloquently. I have experienced them also. In my case, it drove me to desperation and I ended up in a mental institution. I am not even sure that the entity is even a single unified force. I used to have different stages of belief, changing as more experiences and knowledge were acquired. In anycase, I will tell you more about my experiences later if you would like to hear them, and in the meantime I will peruse your blog while waiting for new posts. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Can you edit the message where I mention psychopathy, in order to add this:Anyway, this concept could be used against me by claiming I&#039;m simply hinting about my true deceitful nature when I write about these synchronicities and my related experience. It could be used to make the allegation that I have somehow invented and created all of these synchronicities, as well as my whole &#034;illness&#034; (I say &#034;illness&#034;, because I don&#039;t think I&#039;m truly mentally ill, but instead a victim of mind control).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Here&#039;s an actual picture taken with a camera (it shows a different part of the message, due to an impulse I had later to hide that part by scrolling down, and probably being mind controlled to do so):http://i.imgur.com/aVNehkg.jpgOh man! Look at the address! It says &#034;a VN ehkg&#034;. VN could be how you say WN without hurting your tongue in the process. So it alludes to white nationalism. I&#039;ve had a history of being a white nationalist, and on the internet I&#039;m mostly known as one. &#034;ehkg&#034; is very close to how &#034;maybe&#034; sounds like in my language. Really, it&#039;s like a caricature of a retarded person saying the word &#034;maybe&#034; in my language (Dobrin knows my native language, and can pretty much verify my statement as well as reveal the language if necessary in the future). So, the whole thing translates to &#034;a white nationalist, maybe (as if spoken by an idiot)&#034;.
