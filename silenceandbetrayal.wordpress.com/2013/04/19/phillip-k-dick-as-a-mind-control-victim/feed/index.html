					<description><![CDATA[So in a strange twist of wikipedia linking, I was reading this very humorous quote from PKD: &#034;Well, once again we are invaded. And, humiliatingly, by a lifeform which is absurd. My colleague Tim Powers once said that Martians could invade us simply by putting on funny hats, and we&#039;d never notice. It&#039;s a sort of low-budget invasion. I guess we&#039;re at the point where we can be amused by the idea of Earth being invaded. (And this is when they really zap you.)&#034;Which lead me to this interesting gentleman, Tim Powers, who, uses actual, documented historical events featuring famous people, but shows another view of them in which occult or supernatural factors heavily influence the motivations and actions of the characters.I think he knows :)]]></description>
