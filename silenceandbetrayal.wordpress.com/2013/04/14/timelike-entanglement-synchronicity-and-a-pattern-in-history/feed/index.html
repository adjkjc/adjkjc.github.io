					<description><![CDATA[For later, maybe.  Reading about Huxley&#039;s description of Utopia, in a 1946 forward to Brave New World, he mentions &#039;the greatest good for the greatest number&#039; in a way that echoes of John Nash&#039;s famous attempt to get a date.Huxley: And the prevailing philosophy of life would be a kind of Higher Utilitarianism, in which the Greatest Happiness principle would be secondary to the Final End principle – the first question to be asked and answered in every contingency of life being: &#034;How will this thought or action contribute to, or interfere with, the achievement, by me and the greatest possible number of other individuals, of man&#039;s Final End?&#034;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/nash/sfeature/sf_nash_12.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Nash&lt;/a&gt;: Nash dates the start of what he terms &#034;mental disturbances&#034; to the early months of 1959 when his wife was pregnant. He has described a process of change &#034;from scientific rationality of thinking into the delusional thinking characteristic of persons who are psychiatrically diagnosed as &#039;schizophrenic&#039; or &#039;paranoid schizophrenic&#039;&#034; including seeing himself as a messenger or having a special function in some way, and with supporters and opponents and hidden schemers, and a feeling of being persecuted, and looking for signs representing divine revelation.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Adam, I posted on your prior article about the Octopus, and you said you wanted to know more about how I was framed. I&#039;ll be happy to tell you about it, but is there some way to email you? I am in your Google+ circle, if that helps. It may end up being somewhat lengthy, and I don&#039;t want to eat up your comments section. Thanks,Dave Garee (P.S. - I also posted under &#034;Harry Bollz&#034; because I forgot to log out. I keep several email accounts because they get &#034;hacked,&#034; or something. I read about the &#034;Air Loom,&#034; and did a little more research because I&#039;d never heard about it. Pretty damned similar to OS, if you ask me!)]]></description>
