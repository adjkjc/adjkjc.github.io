					<description><![CDATA[Can you edit the message where I mention psychopathy, in order to add this:Anyway, this concept could be used against me by claiming I&#039;m simply hinting about my true deceitful nature when I write about these synchronicities and my related experience. It could be used to make the allegation that I have somehow invented and created all of these synchronicities, as well as my whole &#034;illness&#034; (I say &#034;illness&#034;, because I don&#039;t think I&#039;m truly mentally ill, but instead a victim of mind control).]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Here&#039;s an actual picture taken with a camera (it shows a different part of the message, due to an impulse I had later to hide that part by scrolling down, and probably being mind controlled to do so):http://i.imgur.com/aVNehkg.jpgOh man! Look at the address! It says &#034;a VN ehkg&#034;. VN could be how you say WN without hurting your tongue in the process. So it alludes to white nationalism. I&#039;ve had a history of being a white nationalist, and on the internet I&#039;m mostly known as one. &#034;ehkg&#034; is very close to how &#034;maybe&#034; sounds like in my language. Really, it&#039;s like a caricature of a retarded person saying the word &#034;maybe&#034; in my language (Dobrin knows my native language, and can pretty much verify my statement as well as reveal the language if necessary in the future). So, the whole thing translates to &#034;a white nationalist, maybe (as if spoken by an idiot)&#034;. This relates to my experiences of many people not really knowing what to think about me, about what I really believe or what motivates me.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Got an opportunity to take pics in connection to the anti-spam code in posting my previous message. Couldn&#039;t find an USB cable for my camera, but here&#039;s a screen shot:http://i.imgur.com/Aa1yPu4.pngThe part where it says &#034;the characters you entered didn&#039;t match&#034; and so on, comes up every time when I try to post, because that whole anti-spam thing is missing when I&#039;m writing my message. I have to press publish or preview to get there, and I always press publish. (Tested it with preview, and as you&#039;d expect, it doesn&#039;t come up in that case.)As for the analysis of that synchronicity: the code is &#034;bylficy&#034;, that is &#034;by l ficy&#034;, which I soon interpreted as &#034;by lord fishy&#034;. It&#039;s supposedly an allusion to me, since people familiar with the external appearance of my case would think there&#039;s something fishy about me to a masterful degree, and they&#039;d think so due to the influence of this entity on me and possibly on themselves. It could also be an allusion to the entity, as the entity is a master of creating suspicious coincidences and so on.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Now I&#039;m cursing out loud that I didn&#039;t take pictures of those two codes I&#039;ve mentioned so far. Either I&#039;m being set up as a liar as usual in many contexts, or not allowed to increase the weight of evidence at this time or ... what? Also, those codes can be refreshed, so I could have been clicking and waiting to get something that would appear meaningful, but the truth is they were both first codes, no refresh.I&#039;ve also been introduced to the idea, which I believe isn&#039;t entirely esoteric (there could&#039;ve been a mention by some actual medical or psychological authority), that psychopaths may hint about their bad intentions to their victims. This idea is especially prominent in Michael Hoffman&#039;s &#034;Secret Societies and Psychological Warfare&#034;. It confuses the lines between confession and perversion. I&#039;d say Hoffman is pretty much fully mind controlled as you&#039;d expect of an eminent writer on the masons and supposed conspiracies and supposed masonic magic.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve taken the liberty to publish one of your comments from another thread as a page on my blog with additional commentary by me (see Statement). Let me know if you&#039;re unhappy with any of this.Here is the intro to it:The vague concepts of delusion and mental illness are used to discredit victims of mind control as lacking insight and not understanding better than psychiatrists what is happening to them, often after a series of superficial interviews to note down symptoms in a general vague sense. Schizophrenia is often considered too much trouble or not treatable by psychoanalysts, while other psychotherapies are quite superficial, often focusing on behavioural modification or modification of ways of thinking, so that those victims of mind control who exhibit some symptoms of schizophrenia can easily be hidden within the larger group of schizophrenics whose symptoms are actually, upon a more detailed examination found to be, very different in some important aspects.What is more, neurologists don&#039;t know the mechanism behind complex hallucination or psychosis. They may not even understand the difference between complex psychosis and simple psychosis. The former is rational or irrational in a way that can be analysed in terms of a story arc; the latter is a break down of mental functions that produces symptoms reminiscent of dementia. It is a distinction I have had to invent words for to even be able to refer to it. Or perhaps I&#039;ve been kept ignorant of an existing distinction, but I doubt that very much.In any case, people are taught to simply assume that all kinds of strange &#034;symptoms&#034; can, and do, occur naturally as a result of mental illness. The film &#034;A Beautiful Mind&#034; serves this purpose by portraying an account of supposed schizophrenia which suggests to the viewer that schizophrenics can live in a pocket universe of hallucinations, basically. People are taught to assume that someone who makes very strange claims for no apparent reason is &#034;simply mentally ill&#034;. In fact, people seem to believe in the validity of psychiatric claims about psychosis with stubborness. Dobrin calls this faith the &#034;comfortable delusion&#034; in the paragraph below.(Not from that page: it now occurs to again that it will be difficult to convince people that the entity is both real and should be opposed as much as possible. People might believe it is real if we can convince them of what I wrote above, in the intro, but then they&#039;d see the suffering it has caused as rather insignificant. I think we need to combine this stuff with convincing argumentation about how world wars and other horrors have been orchestrated by relatively few individuals manipulated by this entity. Not sure what to say about the idea that some individuals have not only been controlled, but also made to serve the entity knowingly. I&#039;m still very doubtful of the illuminati being anything more than a distracting and intimidating myth, so that&#039;s something to think about as well when formulating a strategy.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[P.S. If by &#034;massive drive&#034; you are referring to a couple of mentions in the mainstream media of possible alien invasion in the future or remarks to that effect, those aren&#039;t associated with any sort of mind control occurring through history, or mind control in the first place, so ultimately there are only a few insignificant individuals writing about these topics with the kind of detail and science and logic based approach Dobrin uses. Everything else is misleading fiction or incoherent ramblings.P.P.S. Try to find case studies of schizophrenia. I bet you can&#039;t find more than a couple of detailed studies or accounts (I&#039;ve tried), and most likely you can find detailed accounts only in memoirs, and even then they are very rare, even though schizophrenics of the paranoid type especially are supposed to be perfectly able to write coherently and to often recover for long periods of time. You can&#039;t find much real information on the supposed disease though beyond superficial and vague consensus notions. Now why would that be?? Could some force be interested in keeping a lid on information about TOTAL mind control by keeping detailed accounts of its most obvious influence away from the historical record?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Is the entity trying to create a record of apparent resistance to hide total mind control?
