		<div class="amp-wp-827eb06">This is a chaper in a long running series.  Contents: <strong><a href="http://unduecoercion.org/p/silence-betrayal_10.html">Engineering Revelation </a></strong></div>
<div class="amp-wp-3ab04b3">For three months in 2010 and early 2011 my reality was <a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2013/03/everything-i-know-about-mindwar.html">transported to a fantasy world</a>.  In this world, thousands of people around me, by my estimation somewhere between 2 and 30 percent of the population is consciously aware of the influence of a powerful external force on the minds of <i>all people.</i>  This fantasy world is reality, but to most it is the stuff of a <i>strong delusion</i>, the truth of the matter, is that this influence has been hidden in much the same way as the existence of God has been questioned in modern times.  Most do not witness it first hand, and because of their lack of experience, dispel any stories as a false perception, or worse–the stuff on insanity.</div>
<div class="amp-wp-3ab04b3"></div>
<div class="amp-wp-3ab04b3">The true insanity is that despite <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18PtOXrzDVE">tens of thousands</a> of people <a href="http://www.bioethics.gov/cms/node/225">crying out loudly</a> about the existence of this force–the population does not believe, simply because they have not seen.  A blanket has been pulled over the eyes of the world, and it has stolen the truth from the minds of the masses.  </div>
<div class="amp-wp-3ab04b3"></div>
<div class="amp-wp-3ab04b3">Some may wonder how we, as witnesses, can be so sure that it is the mass of disbelievers that are truly suffering from a delusion, rather than the group of so called victims.  It’s not a bad question, and I not only understand disbelief, had I not witnessed this first hand I most likely would have agreed.  It is because of how we learned about this entity, over a long period of time, by having small revelation after small revelation that proves to us, <i>beyond a reasonable doubt</i>, that we are not wrong.  The truth is, the story told to us is so complex, so intertwined with reality, history, and religion that there is no conceivable way you could deny it once you have seen proof not only in the world around you, but also saved in our cultural record for all time.  </div>
<div class="amp-wp-3ab04b3"></div>
<div class="amp-wp-3ab04b3">The world I was transported to was much like the fictional stories described in the <a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2012/11/how-do-you-know-part-2.html">movie <i>Fallen, </i>and the television show </a><i><a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2012/11/how-do-you-know-part-2.html">Joan of Arcadia</a>.</i>  In reality though, it is much more pervasive than those depictions.  I have witnessed, at different times, up to forty people in one location performing what victims have termed “street theater.”  The phenomenon is akin to a large group of people performing a skit, as if on stage, but in broad daylight.  Their words and actions are choreographed, not by some evil director, <a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2013/04/the-cia-mind-control-and-judicial-system.html">nor the CIA</a>, but by an entity which has not only written the script itself, but also performs it as if it were a puppet-master. 
<p>These skits are made even more realistic by the knowing and unknowing inclusion of those you know well in their performance. Unknowingly, some can be made to utter small phrases, or act in such a manner that it appears they are aware of the broad skit.  At the same time, often there are agent provocateurs placed  the life of the victim. In my case, my ex-wife and current girlfriend was heavily involved in the performance, playing a “starring role” which increased the feeling of realism, by utilizing my trust and love for her.  Without the addition of agents known to the victim, it might appear as nothing more than an outside attack by an unknown force, this is dispelled quite easily.</p></div>
<div class="amp-wp-3ab04b3"></div>
<div class="amp-wp-3ab04b3"></div>
<div class="amp-wp-3ab04b3">These “skits” were complex, and told a story.  Slowly but surely over the three month period it became apparent that the people that were performing these scripts could hear my thoughts.  Many of them included <a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2013/01/he-knows-who-we-are.html">“psychic” undertones,</a> others were threatening, some had clearly <a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2013/02/the-lake-of-fire.html">religious undertones</a>, and yet <a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2013/01/now-you-know.html">others were comical</a>.  Regardless of the theme, all included real time responses to inner monologue, and the purpose of doing so was well hidden.  As it was happening, I believed the sole purpose was to create the appearance of schizophrenia, which resulted in my abject silence about what was happening.  I was scared to retell these stories, and this fear too, was injected with mind control–a <b>tactic that was exposed during the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vq3wTRDe0CA">MK-ULTRA hearings in 1996</a></b>.  Despite a significant amount of testimony, and written documentation about this programs, and <a href="http://mankindresearchunlimited.weebly.com/psychotronic-history.html">obvious proof</a> of the existence of the technology, the general view of the psychiatric community and the world is that the symptoms which have been identified by numerous victims as being the result of advanced technology are rather the result of a psychiatric condition.  This itself, is a<b> societal delusion.</b></div>
<div class="amp-wp-3ab04b3"><b><br></b></div>
<div class="amp-wp-3ab04b3">The true mechanism behind “street theater” became clear to me much later.  It wasn’t the people who could hear my thoughts, but rather this entity, the grand script writer.  The lines were written in such a way to make it look as if the actors were reading from a teleprompter, and in fact they were.  The teleprompter was <i>mind control</i>, however because I was made to believe I was a test subject, I did not believe that this was possible.  Instead, I was told that they were using an advanced radio communication system, though others believe their lines are delivered via text messages, or some other less advanced technology.  The end result of this, is a search for the truth, and this is exactly what I did.</div>
<div class="amp-wp-3ab04b3"></div>
<div class="amp-wp-3ab04b3">Because much of the street theater I received revolved around organized crime and narcotics trafficking, after the street theater stopped I began to search for the perpetrator of the crime.  I read books about organized crime and its relationship to the CIA, and firmly believed I had traced the source to the <b>Secret Team, </b>a group within the Central Intelligence Agency which was linked to narcotics trafficking during the Korean and Vietnam wars, as well as he JFK assassination, and Iran Contra.  My research, including the very books I read, and right down to my understanding of their meaning was directed by mind control technology, but I did not know it at the time.  This was my grand deception:  I believed firmly that I was a test subject, and that my thoughts could be read, but because the only interaction I had with this entity was through other people and electronic communications I did not think it could directly manipulate my senses or thoughts.  </div>
<div class="amp-wp-3ab04b3"></div>
<div class="amp-wp-3ab04b3">I was wrong, and that was made clear much later.  What is even more amazing, is that manipulation of my senses was proven to me in the very beginning, during the <a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2013/02/the-lake-of-fire.html">Lake of Fire</a>.  Even though I experienced it first hand, and was directed to CIA MK-ULTRA research, I was unable to connect those two very simple dots — this proves to me beyond a shadow of a doubt the power of mind control.  This entity was able to fog my understanding of what was happening to such a degree that my first hand memories, which I was fully aware of at the time, did not make the logical connection that would have told me that I was being manipulated as well as surveiled.  What becomes clear, when you do realize that, is that your reaction to the street theater is also part of the script, that you too, have little to no “free will” when confronted with this phenomenon.</div>
<div class="amp-wp-3ab04b3"></div>
<div class="amp-wp-3ab04b3">I now know that my research into the CIA and MK-ULTRA was directed by this entity, most likely to cause me, like many others, to blame this organization for the “mind control research” that was being done to me.  To further this delusion, I later did a significant amount of research into how this technology worked, as well as possible countermeasures.  Like many other “targeted individuals,” humorous to me now, as all around us are unknowing victims, I searched through their stories and their explanations, and was made to believe the <a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2013/01/what-is-oseh-organized-stalking-and.html">silliest of explanations</a>, and then later, <i>understood</i> that they were not the truth.</div>
<div class="amp-wp-3ab04b3"></div>
<div class="amp-wp-3ab04b3">I bought RF detectors to search for the source of <b>mind control radiation</b>, built Faraday cages, and searched high and low for the source of what I imagined must have been a TEMPEST like interferometer which was being used to remotely read EMF emissions from my brain.  At one point I painted an entire room with RF shielding paint, in order to create a “safe place,” away from the neural surveillance which was tormenting me.  Despite all my efforts, I would continue to receive messages from this entity which let me know, beyond a doubt, that it could continue to hear my thoughts.  In the beginning it was not clear how often “they” were listening, however this facade too slowly fell apart, and I was aware that this was ’round the clock.’  </div>
<div class="amp-wp-3ab04b3"></div>
<div class="amp-wp-3ab04b3">Once it became clear that my thoughts and feelings were being manipulated, it was “revealed” once again that there was no possible mechanism other than nanotechnology which would allow for the remote activation of individual neurons, which through my research, I had “deduced” was the only possible way to change a persons <i>feelings</i> and their understanding of the world around them.  I settled on a kind of technology called remote neural recording and stimulation, and found that there is publicly available <a href="http://redishlab.neuroscience.umn.edu/papers/2009%20ibcom%20embc.pdf">modern day research</a> into this type of technology.</div>
<div class="amp-wp-3ab04b3"></div>
<div class="amp-wp-3ab04b3">At this point you may be thinking to yourself, as I did, that this “research project” must cost a fortune in manpower and resources.  Round the clock surveillance, complete with almost daily custom tailored messages designed to frighten and intimidate the subject… I often wondered if they had a team of monkeys working around the clock on me.  It was a silly delusion, but because of the influence of mind control, I believed it wholeheartedly.  It would not be until much later that the truth was revealed, and I finally understood that this entity watches, listens, and changes the lives of all people on the Earth, all the time.  This is what was being hidden–that there were no resources being used, no money spent, no people sitting behind computer monitors–this is what this entity <i>does.</i>  The large group of people I encountered at first were not who they said they were, they were the Synagogue of Satan, a group that knowingly works with this entity in order to create the <i>false delusion</i> described in Revelation.  Their sole purpose, in the very end, was to frame the CIA and organized crime for using mind control in order to take over the world.   It is now clear that these groups are all used by the entity, though I imagine many fewer than I first believe do so knowingly.  It is a master of deception, and its great skill is subtly manipulating the strengths and weaknesses of <i>all people </i>into doing its bidding.  </div>
<div class="amp-wp-3ab04b3"></div>
<div class="amp-wp-3ab04b3">In the end, it was all to prove the existence of an outside force, one that has not been hidden as I had once thought, but has been openly written about for thousands of years, in our religious literature.  Revelation tells us that the end times are the revelation of truth on the entire world, and the truth is that now is the time that our society has evolved (<a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2012/10/evil-empire.html">with help</a>) to the point of being able to understand the technology behind religion.  Today, government researchers and intelligence organizations are <i class="amp-wp-043cdae">most certainly aware</i> that the stories that have been told as myths of occult magic are in fact prima facie <a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2012/11/of-divinity-and-devil.html">evidence of the influence of an extra-terrestrial force on humankind</a>… and yet they remain silent.</div>
<p><span id="goog_1624089004"></span><span id="goog_1624089005"></span><a href="http://www.blogger.com/"></a></p>
<div class="amp-wp-3ab04b3">This time has been chosen, because we finally have the capability to understand <b>how</b> this has happened; when the technology is revealed publicly, please return here, and understand that it has been <a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2012/11/nobody-is-mind-controlling-me.html"><span id="goog_1624089001"></span>all around<span id="goog_1624089002"></span></a> us for <a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2013/01/the-hidden-hand.html">a very</a>, very <a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2013/01/the-dendera-light_24.html">long time</a>.</div>
<div class="amp-wp-3ab04b3"></div>
<div class="amp-wp-3ab04b3">Throughout my ordeal, I was often asked to question <b>why</b>, rather than <b>how, </b>though I ignored this as subterfuge.  Now it is the question I seek the answer to the most, and I hope we will receive it together.</div>
