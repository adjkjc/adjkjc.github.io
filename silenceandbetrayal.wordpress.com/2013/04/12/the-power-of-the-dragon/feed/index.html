					<description><![CDATA[Found it. It can be found in Adam Crabtree&#039;s book, &#034;Multiple Man&#034;. Wilson recounts the case on pages 69-71 of &#034;Afterlife&#034;. Here are the most relevant parts:&#034;[The case] concerned a man called Marius, who taught history in a university and held a good position with a government health agency. He had been a happily married man until, for no reason he could understand, he suddenly began to experience murderous impulses towards his wife. He seemed to be driven by &#039;some relentless inner compulsion to see blood&#039;. These impulses were so strong that he believed he might lose control and kill her.&#034;&#034;...[Marius] was looking through his collection of coins when he found that one had been displaced and put on a shelf. He had no memory of doing this. A window screen that he had repaired was torn, and again he could find no explanation. It was after this that he began to hear a voice in his head. It told him that he — the voice — was the man he had seen in his dream, and that he was permanently inside Marius. To prove it, he had twice taken possession of him, moving the coin and tearing the screen. He could, he said, possess him whenever he liked.&#034;An obvious case involving mind control, although reading it now I can see the ambiguity of the supposed evidence of the alleged blackout possessions (to coin a new term): the details given in Wilson&#039;s book don&#039;t seem to be enough for drawing a solid conclusion about how the changes in his environment were accomplished.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m pretty sure the reference is in &#034;Afterlife&#034;, which I don&#039;t have at the moment. (I&#039;ll come back to comment here once I do.) Before I remembered that, I looked at the index of &#034;Beyond the Occult&#034;. This book seems to recount several cases of possession (I&#039;ve read the book but no longer remember it too well). I read a bit of one now, a case that took place in the 17th century: an exorcist tried to exorcise nuns, but was himself temporarily possessed, and such possessions would continue intermittently over a 25 year period, stopping completely for five years before his death. Possessions like this don&#039;t seem to involve blackouts, just overt, forcible control of the body or its parts, and at least sometimes obvious (to us) mind control of some sort. One example is that when this man tried to make the sign of a cross during a &#034;possession&#034;, the entity would force his hand away or make him bite it &#034;savagely&#034;. Another example from the case I was reading is a nun on her back (on the floor?), masturbating and shouting to the exorcist: &#034;come on, f*** me.&#034;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You are right in that it is widespread and growing. The technology is able to be used on almost everyone. There are exceptional people whom have a built-in resistance that cannot be fought against. The technology is based largely on nanotech as you surmised. My own nanotech device was brought to my attention in a way that surprised me. They sent instructions to have the device show itself to me. It was barely able to be seen but was as wide as a thin pencil line , like old thin lead mechanical pens. It came out as one line about 1/2 an inch long. It then split into a line 2/3 of original line length and then the remainder of the original line . The part that remained 2/3 length then split evenly so as to now have three equal length  lines all in a row with a small space between each section. the action totaled about five seconds for the original separation sequence. There was a time of about 3 seconds of no movement and then it rapidly assembled again and returned again to it&#039;s domain underneath my skin. The device is dark black in color though it seems to be a grey color when changing configuration. I have had no noticeable health problems that can be associated with the device and I only have a small worry about what it can do if I become too large a liability. Perhaps I have said too much but then again maybe I have said too little too late. ?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I am interested.  I imagine Wilson is a fiction author you enjoy reading.  I&#039;ve had a number of experiences that closely parallel works of fiction that I enjoyed reading as a youth, including Orson Scott Card and Stephen King.  I have come to the conclusion, of course, that I read the books initially because of the influence of the entity, knowing full well its plans to use them in the future in my um.. &#039;escapades.&#039;]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[On a second thought, I guess a complete blackout and being taken over by this entity, as I described seemed to have happened once when I was walking outside, could explain it. The entity would have to have positioned me exactly where I was before the blackout, in the exact same pose, but I suppose it wouldn&#039;t be beyond its powers. I also remember reading about this being-taken-over-and-experiencing-a-blackout-about-it phenomenon in one of Colin Wilson&#039;s books. I&#039;ll try to find the exact reference for you if you&#039;re interested.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[@AdamI believe I mentioned unusual hallucinations as a possible explanation the first time I recounted that experience here. I lamented that I didn&#039;t attempt to make a call with the cellphone before I put it back to its usual place in my apartment, to verify it wasn&#039;t a hallucinated object.The problem with your particular explanation is that I remember perfectly well what happened. There was *no* lapse at any point when I came back to my apartment, and I immediately noticed the phone in my coat pocket after I had opened the door to the main room, the other end of which usually houses my cellphone, and where I was certain I had left it. So I&#039;d literally have to be a Superman and be able to move faster than light to have grabbed that cellphone from the other end of the room, opened my pocket, placed it there, closed my pocket, then taken the same pose I was in before the feat, and then have my memory of it suppressed, and continue on as if nothing had happened. Impossible. (Incidentally, I have a new section about false memory at my website.)Whether it&#039;s teleportion or hallucination makes no difference in the context of this discussion anyway. If the entity can produce hallucinations like that, then it could easily plant &#034;objects&#034; (persistent mass hallucination) as well as make them appear to be missing (&#034;steal&#034; them), without human help whatsoever. (That&#039;s not to rule out unknowing human help in some cases, but I&#039;d say it&#039;s a more elegant explanation than human conspiracy, and interestingly I seem to be the only self-identified &#034;TI&#034; who thinks so. Which must mean something.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I do believe it is an extraterrestrial force ultimately responsible for this phenomenon.  I am also personally aware of a number of people who participate in this crime, knowingly, with full memory of it.  I do believe that everyone who participates is coerced to do so using mind control, however some are fully aware of what they are doing.  It is possible and likely that a number of individuals participate without their knowledge.Regarding the &lt;a href=&quot;http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2012/12/a-blind-eye.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;&#034;End Times.&#034;&lt;/a&gt;  I certainly do not think that the group of targets is destined to be the only one that &#034;survives the apocalypse.&#034;  In recent history, it appears that this group is destined to be a group of obvious martyrs in the future, sad as that is.  At the same time, we may be beyond the Fifth Trumpet already, in which case martyrdom would not be an assured fate.I also had a charade performed at a hospital, I can tell you the entire thing was a fabricated play, performed by &#034;professional actors&#034; (not to say they are actually actors, but professional operatives performing a military (or worse) grade psychological operation on the victim.  There may have been truth in the story, but it was also riddled with lies and deception, I can promise you that.  The entire point is to manipulate your belief system and world outlook. What happened with your framing?  I&#039;m very curious.I do not doubt that your grandmother had a religious experience.  Again, these are the weapons of this entity, religion and spirituality are used against not only the victims, but also the perpetrators and general public.  Gang-stalking itself will one day prove that religion has been used as a weapon of a monolithic force for a long, long time.Truth is a funny thing. Towards the latter part of my experience, the phrases &#034;your truth,&#034; &#034;our truth,&#034; and &#034;my truth&#034; have been used repeatedly.  While I firmly believe there is only one &#039;real truth&#039; it appears this entity would have us believe that &#039;perception is reality&#039; (another commonly uttered phrase), and that &#039;the truth&#039; may in fact be beyond our understanding.  Either that, or it would sicken us to the point of no return. :)Strive to be &#039;over the experience&#039; rather than to find the penultimate truth, that road leads to a dark place.]]></description>
