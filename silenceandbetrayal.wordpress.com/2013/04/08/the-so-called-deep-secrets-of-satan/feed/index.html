					<description><![CDATA[@RyanThe easiest way for you to criticise his ideas should be to demonstrate that yours are more elegant. This would require explaining how the concepts of delusion, hallucination, and unconscious mind don&#039;t provide you with a holy trinity at least as elusive and omnipotent as his &#034;god&#034;, for explaining away anomalous phenomena. In fact, you are required to do this in any case.Good luck.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Studies have been conducted that indicate that humans are surprisingly quick to draw the conclusion that an otherwise random event contains a pattern. It&#039;s the product of confirmation bias and wishful-thinking. The sense of importance one must feel believing that he is a critical part or member of some cosmic order could very easily disengage any powers of reality-testing necessary to consider a more natural explanation. Schizophrenics and religious fanatics both have one aspect of their neurological structure in common: The D4 dopamine receptor networks. The most active forms of the D4 receptors create a sense of skepticism towards science and a willingness to accept mystical/mythical explanations for natural occurrences. They are likely to believe in God/gods, for example. On the other hand, the least active forms tend to leave the person with a rational, materialist, scientific view of reality. They are more likely to be atheists and/or scientists. The demiurge concept sounds no different than God, but instead laced with esoteric devices and twisted understandings of the current physics of the natural world. It&#039;s convenient to have an entity that is technologically advanced; one that could, in effect, leave no trail of evidence so as to bankrupt any rational, epistemic criticism of it. I&#039;m sorry to have to say that, though these narratives are well-written and very entertaining, they would be better suited as fiction stories than a testimony professing to bear a sacred truth about humanity. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I tend to agree with the above. This started when you met your wife. Could the demon have been attached to her? Then attached to you. An old enough, strong enough entity is capable of everything you described, and more. If you were older than time and had eternity, playing with one or two or twelve short life spans is nothing but entertainment. A movie for them, if you will. I would at least explore that avenue a little bit. If for no other reason than to rule it out. The things you describe have been someones crazy story, throughout time. And that is why there are many &#034;banishings&#034; just as old. To block the entity (s). Whatever we decide to call it. God, satan, spirit, mind control, aliens, ect..]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m not saying something like, for example, framing a person for a crime he didn&#039;t commit could have been faked. However, you don&#039;t know what goes on in the minds of these people when they do those things. To continue the example, potentially all you need to do to frame someone in America is lie to an FBI officer about someone&#039;s connection in a crime. The person perpetrating the lie could be anyone who knows you, and could imagine doing it to get a reduced sentence, without any idea the entity orchestrated the whole thing or even exists. The gov need not be knowingly involved, they could just be doing their job. The entity could even materialise or organise physical evidence against you in a way that only you would realise something is conspiring against you.That&#039;s just one example. But in a similar manner, I can explain any other case I&#039;ve read about or experienced. Of course, you seem to think the entity doesn&#039;t want to make it easy for you to prove these things, so for the entity to keep human conspiracy to a minimum (so that objective observers would have to keep guessing) could be the way it operates.Perhaps you have some story that unambiguously demonstrates a conspiracy on the part of humans that involves you or some other &#034;targeted individual&#034;, but I don&#039;t think I&#039;ve yet heard of it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Torch effect, btw, is a reference to a Biblical story, I think &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gideon_(Bible)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;about Gideon&lt;/a&gt;.  It&#039;s cute how he tells us all his secrets, isn&#039;t it?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s definitely real.  I imagine that the entity uses the &#034;torch&#034; effect in order to increase the appearance of paranoia in victims, that is it is most likely augmented by induced auditory and perhaps visual hallucinations.  However the existence of the group of people perpetrating it is unquestionable.  I know some of them, there is no way the entire thing could be faked, when there is a documented trail of events that result from it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have only done a cursory look, but haven&#039;t found anything either.  I&#039;m going to see if I can find one specifically aimed at cases of Fregoli, as that seems the closest to what I have experienced, and what you would expect if this entity really does get a kick out of the &lt;i&gt;Fallen&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Joan of Arcadia&lt;/i&gt; method of communication.As an aside, I was thinking about that specific method of communication yesterday, and what I come up with is that it allows for our &#034;world view&#034; to accept the fact that there is an entity that can &#034;read&#034; our thoughts, without needing to believe that our senses and thoughts can also be modified.  This allows &#034;victims&#034; to believe that they have not lost free will, and be manipulated more easily, while still being aware of the force.   Obviously, it puts us at a disadvantage, to believe that our intuition, and decisions cannot be influenced--while at the same time believing (or knowing) that we are dealing with a type of entity/technology/supernatural force that significantly changes our perception of reality; further putting us at a disadvantage by inciting behavior that is intentionally irrational in order to combat an irrational enemy.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dear OP:  I think you have inadvertently opened a door for demonic possession to take place. While we all struggle with the forces of good and evil continuously, your description of the &#034;entity&#034; you have been talking with for so long is the typical description of a demonic entity. The ONLY way out and away from this is thru the POWER OF THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST THAT WAS SHED TO PAY FOR ALL OUR OUR SINS!  Frankly, I believe you should find yourself a good reputable known exorcist who is deeply rooted in their FAITH IN JESUS and let them PRAY and CONDUCT THE RIGHT OF EXORCISM to get this thing out of your life and you heart.  DO NOT GIVE UP. AS LONG AS YOU ARE ALIVE, YOU ARE HUMAN AND NO MATTER WHAT YOUR SINS MAY BE, YOU CAN BE SAVED!  Although this entity will doubtlessly tell you otherwise. Or deny the existence of JESUS and his ATONEMENT FOR OUR SINSBy the way, I do not for one second doubt the validity and truthfulness of your account. But before this becomes a generational curse and passes on to your children - please get some help. This thing is older, smarter, and more powerful than any human alive. ONLY JESUS HAS THE POWER TO BREAK THIS THINGS HOLD ON YOU AND YOUR FAMILY. DO NOT GIVE UP AND ASK FOR HELP FROM JESUS. He will hear you and he will answer your prayers seeking him!GOD BE WITH YOU]]></description>
