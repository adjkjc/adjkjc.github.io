					<description><![CDATA[Stay Strong........Do not give up on life. I know that there are a great deal of inhumane individuals out there that make you feel that life is not worth living, but it is.

Karma will eventually catch up to them, if not on earth in the after life...........Keep mentally strong, and do exercise it will help you relieve your stress........Valley Girl.........]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Strange that you state that the radio broadcast was not real but created for her to here. I too have experienced this sort of programming on my radio&#039;s. A couple were so strange that I was not able to capture because I was in my vehicle. However, I was able to record one of the fake broadcasts that was coming through my radio. It was the strangest broadcast of a scientific doctor, saying you are angry, you feel very angry. I have the recording and I immediately knew when I had heard several of these strange recordings that they were being transmitted from commercial radio frequency tower that was installed in my neighbors yard when all this ordeal started back in 2004. From Valley Girl.....I post on other blogs and go by valley Girl.....San fernando Valley CA....]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Four different technologies you must look into.1. Chemicals involved in MKULTRA SERIES.2. Microwave auditory effect - how microwave can transmit payload to affect the brain.3. Frequency following response - recorded or modified emotion can be injected to your brain possibly by microwave carrier technology.4. advanced wall crawling robot - robot that defies gravity. - All victims claim some sort of chemical compound release into their place of rest and food.Good luck in your research. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Or not.  That was a scattered interview.  Only a few things that resonated with me.It was so incoherent though.  I thought of going to Colvin&#039;s website and seeing what he&#039;s done.  But, whichever one said it, I disagree that this is a benevolent entity.  He should know better.Also, their take on Indrid Cold was completely removed from mine and Keel&#039;s also.At any rate, since I moved to my new home several years ago in a nearby community, I have not had the sensation of being on camera.I feel safe.  Other than the incident and timing of the second wren, I have had no really odd occurances. Except for all the synchronicities surrounding the Mothman.When I made a conscious effort to remove things that generate and feed on paranormal occurances, the occurances themselves lost power over me.Rightly or wrongly, I feel endowed of a greater capacity to see the truth behind the lies.I believe that words have power.We have a greater ability to manifest things concrete than we realize.Upon taking myself away from the immediate situation, it still took years to overcome the mental anxiety.  I wrote this for the sole purpose of letting you know that I believe your situation is real.I believe it is a dark spirit of Satanic influence that you need to discern and remove.These are influencing the more human explanations of MK ULTRA mind control, because we live in a Luciferian world...for now.But, all the powers of the world are in their positions because of it and through it.Yes, the NAZIs openly cultivated it and the US and England coveted the secrets and technology they were given.  I believe that the Reich has not ended.  It just migrated.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have so much to say about synchronicity its not funny, but I don&#039;t want to spoil the end of the story.  I hope it&#039;s the end.. at least.I&#039;m writing day and night to get the entire thing out.  It&#039;s a drive I have not experienced before.  I am certain its not from within.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I hadn&#039;t heard of Haslam before, appreciate the info.  I like to believe that most people, when thinking objectively about it, and knowing about the abilities of mind control, would not think that Hitler&#039;s seemingly magical influence as an orator was due to actual speaking.I think the &#034;help&#034; he received during WW2 is obvious, in hindsight.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I read Brotherhood of the Bell also, I think it might be on the TI &#034;short list.&#034;  I feel like many of the books I read immediately after the gang-stalking started were ... well, controlled reading.The other big one I read during that time was The Last Circle, by Cheri Seymour.  When I initially read Brotherhood of the Bell I did not think much of it was true.  While I believe that the Nazi&#039;s were working on UFO &#034; technology, much of it, like The Montauk Project (which I think is a huge info-op deception in itself), is designed to &#034;send feelers out&#034; for the kind of lie you are willing to believe.I have however gone back over some of it, and now believe that his ideas about Kaluza-Klein are right on target.  There has obviously been a huge, and now widening, information gap between the military/government and educational research sectors in physics.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I would be remiss if I did not post a link to an expanation about &#034;The Mothman...&#034; and the synchronicities.I did not have any notion really about it when I read the book, having only seen the movie years before which is a glossover Hollywood version.I thought maybe posting a link which I have not fully listened to yet, but have a feeling I will be surprised by nonetheless.  It&#039;s an interview with Andy Colvin.  Other than the intro, I have heard nothing nor read anything by him.  I just happened upon his link and based on intuition will drop it here.We&#039;ll find out together how he connects the dots.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwk08gFgesoAfterward, I&#039;ll post my own thoughts and usualavoidance of the topic.  I post it now and then as a warning to others.  I think John Keel and Dr. Jacques Vallee nailed the definitive explanation for Aliens and what they really are.If not how they relate to the dark forces that are influencing the minds and have the world in it&#039;s grip.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xwk08gFgeso]]></description>

The forerunner book, &#034;Mary, Ferrie and the Monkey Virus&#034;.Did you already know of this research before I mentioned it?Also, you last post rang similar bells,(pun), because it reminded me of the first book in Joseph P.
