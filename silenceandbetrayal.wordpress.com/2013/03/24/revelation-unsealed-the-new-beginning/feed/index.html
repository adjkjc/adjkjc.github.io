					<description><![CDATA[Off-topic, but I hope you have one of these in your exterior doors:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disc_tumbler_lockI&#039;ve read that 90% of American door locks use pins, so they&#039;re often easy to pick, and even the newest and best of them have generally been &#034;cracked&#034; and cheap equipment and information on how to get through them without leaving signs of a break-in are widely available. I think those disc tumbler locks are a better bet if you want some basic security in your house or apartment. (Of course, different types of disc locks have varying levels of security as well.)]]></description>
