					<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s possible, but unlikely, that it is &#034;greater&#034; than our universe.   The evidence I have points to an external influence, one that is capable of transcending time, yet for some odd reason takes an active interest in the daily lives of many individuals.I imagine that this microscopic interest is nothing more than the manifestation of a macroscopic desire to control the fate of our species as a whole.  I come to this conclusion based on what I have perceived as its complete lack of regard for human life, and disinterest in what we consider &#034;right&#034; and &#034;wrong.&#034;  In my experience, it is the defining force behind the creation of our rules, simply so it has the benefit of being the best rule breaker.I&#039;m sure its not what you were asking for.  What is missing, to you?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m still really confused - i feel like no matter how much I read of your work that *something* is missing to help me understand exactly whats going on.Is it in our DNA? Is it not only extra, and ultraterrestrial, but part of the fabric of our space-time reality? Something is not clicking.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank God I took the time to read your site again! I&#039;d seen it before in researching the veracity of a well-known advocate&#039;s claims, but never saw this particular theory presented. I saw one of your posts on GLP, and decided to take another look.I wholeheartedly agree with everything you&#039;ve said in this &#034;knowledge transfer.&#034; The main reason I believe this is because I KNOW my family. They would NEVER turn into &#034;perps,&#034; and for me to actually believe that they would, would be worse than death. I never will belive it, and though I initially suspected it, after discarding myriad theories, I know better now. I also strongly suspected my neighbors of knowingly being involved with my stalking, but their behavior was anathema to their personalities, I never got aggressive with them because I didn&#039;t have irrefutable proof that they were knowingly doing this of their own volition.I can tell you that I&#039;ve been framed, jailed, and suffered numerous and tortuous abuses. But I&#039;ve also learned things, too, and become a stronger person. I&#039;m really dying to know what the hell is behind this phenomenon! That said, I don&#039;t condone torture of any kind, and &#034;gangstalking&#034; is certainly torture.I&#039;m going to hang around here and take all this in, but I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll comment a bit more at some point. Stay strong, and keep at this. You&#039;re on to something here.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The modern governments have a tendency to use violent incidents as an excuse to undermine liberty and increase their control through oppressive laws, etc. etc.The entity itself is unlikely to care if you kill a couple of humans. The death toll of wars in the past hundred years alone has been dozens of millions of more or less innocent people. That doesn&#039;t mean the entity will make sure there will never be war again.I don&#039;t even see why anyone should care about &#034;gang stalking&#034;, unless it involves break-ins or other crimes. But then you should deal with those crimes as you would anyway: by increasing the security of your home, buying a gun or learning martial arts, reporting the crime if it&#039;s notable enough, and so on. TI&#039;s aren&#039;t the only people on earth who have to endure burglaries or whatever.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I certainly haven&#039;t answered all the questions, but I&#039;ve found what I think is the best explanation for what I have experienced.  That being said, I&#039;d much prefer a world where this entity was much nicer, than one without it at all.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Life without this entity, are you sure it would be a high tech paradise of non-violence, no disease, no grief and loss, and no suffering? I&#039;m not sure why you think natural selection and a mechanistic universe would produce such results. Of course, since you believe that natural selection has produced a species capable of building this God-like machine, you think it&#039;s possible. But that sort of reasoning would be circular in nature, since you haven&#039;t yet demonstrated that such evolution is possible to begin with.I, for my part, remain sceptical that there is a mechanistic explanation for the existence of this universe and how it works. You haven&#039;t solved all the mysteries of the world, so why do you write as if you had?Re free will being a myth: in its widest sense, I suppose it is. But whatever humans are in their natural state, they are still creatures capable of learning something. Nature teaches them the hard way, and without any sense of irony or comedy or anything redeeming about the experience, why wouldn&#039;t God be like nature except better? It seems to me that a mechanistic universe would be lesser in its potential to inspire or stimulate.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I have no idea what humans would have achieved or not achieved without this entity, and what their lives would be like. That includes my own. In SOME cases, it&#039;s obvious that aspects of their lives would be much better. I particularly dislike the idea that some people have to endure hallucinated bugs crawling on their skin and causing itching, and all such similar experiences. I honestly don&#039;t think anyone really deserves that sort of thing. The only punishment anyone &#034;deserves&#034; is painless death, so I&#039;m of course a bit conflicted about the concept of karma. I guess it&#039;s a nice concept for the lucky, but not so nice for the unlucky, I mean if it&#039;s not true. I much prefer mercy to &#034;justice&#034; anyway, as increasing pain and suffering isn&#039;t a sane way to combat pain and suffering. Still, IF karma is a cosmic law, then there&#039;s little point in trying to argue yourself out of it. I can vaguely understand how it might be a cosmic law, and why. I won&#039;t bother to argue my case though. I don&#039;t know which would be worse, karma + reincarnation or a mind controlling alien machine + only one life per &#034;person&#034;. I think I&#039;d rather take the latter.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In my case specifically, I have received numerous threats of death and bodily harm from participants in &#034;street theater,&#034; as well as &#034;Mary&#034; and people related to her.  These threats were most likely designed in order to control behavior through the use of fear, which is also consistent with torture.Just because it is not done in a locked room does not mean it&#039;s OK.]]></description>
