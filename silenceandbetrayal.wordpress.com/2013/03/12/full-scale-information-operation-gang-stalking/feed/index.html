					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m aware of timelike quantum entanglement. Can you explain to me in plain English why you think it unambiguously indicates the reality of the future and the past?I&#039;ve put some serious effort into thinking about the nature of time, even if I have forgotten most of what I learned and made an irrelevant mistake above while talking about it. Anyway, the impression I have got is that eternalism isn&#039;t as widely believed in as you think. I think most physicists don&#039;t make any such ontological claims, they just use the math and don&#039;t pretend to fully understand what it implies or that they have figured out the nature of reality. The theoretical physicist C.W. Rietdijk is a prominent proponent of the view that special relativity necessitates eternalism, this argument having been named after him and Putnam. The very fact that he is known for this argument indicates that most physicists simply don&#039;t think that way. I&#039;ve seen writers on the topic dismiss his argument with only a few words, and those are the ones who bother to reference it at all. Einstein himself didn&#039;t think that way until someone else &#034;convinced&#034; him that his theory implies eternalism. The guy who drew my attention to timelike quantum entanglement once wrote to me that &#034;you need to be very careful about expanding experiments and math into wide concepts.&#034; He continued, &#034;The fact is we don&#039;t know how quantum effects are accomplished mechanically even though we can describe them very precisely in mathematical terms. In the extreme, it is sometimes stated by reputable physicists that there is no mechanism, only math.&#034;Do you have something to add to that?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My contention is that it talks to these people, specifically, in order to destroy them.  Further, to destroy them for doing its bidding... &#034;willingly.&#034;  That&#039;s something you might expect from the personality that it has imparted on us, no? (Satan, Loki, The fairly guy from the Flintstones).As far as spacetime, I think Einstein mathematically and geometrically described it.  His four dimensional reality is fairly well accepted.  There is also some research that the very same technology I believe is utilized in order to control electricity remotely can also work (and communicate) through time.&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/01/timelike-entanglement/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Quantum Entanglement through Time&lt;/a&gt;That would also open up the possibility that this is.. an advanced computer we created, working from the future.  Kinda like Terminator without the Terminators, I guess.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I wouldn&#039;t know what its motives are. I just think that whatever they are, it can accomplish them just fine without asking someone to do things. If it&#039;s a machine that exists on this level of reality and has required repair in the past, as you think and have speculated, it could have just mind controlled some people to invent the tools, find it and repair it, and then killed them. They could&#039;ve thought they were dreaming. Or the entity could&#039;ve sleep walked them there and made them repair the machine in their sleep.Of course, if it HAS revealed itself to some group of elites, and they are assisting it knowingly, then some inferences could be drawn perhaps. However, I&#039;m not aware of any solid evidence that any such group exists.Re time travel, we haven&#039;t discussed it, but I personally think time travel is even less credible as a concept than karma or ghosts. If you believe there exists some invisible yet real place called the past that is supposedly located in the same place as the present and the future, then I don&#039;t see why you wouldn&#039;t believe there exists some invisible yet real place called the spirit world that shares the location of the physical world. What makes the concrete existence of the past even more unbelievable is that there would have to be a near infinite number of those past worlds, corresponding to each moment you might want to travel to, and to avoid paradoxes and instantaneous, causeless effects, you&#039;d have to assume that different choices would produce different time lines (i.e. even more worlds occupying the same location yet invisible to observers in other worlds), or that all of the moments in time have always existed ever since their simultaneous creation and there will never be anything truly new and nothing will ever change (a time traveller changing something in the past would already have done that innumerable times before as well as in the future). Ultimately, time travel doesn&#039;t make any sense because the past and the future as realistically existing things don&#039;t make any sense. I think it&#039;s safe to say that interpretations of QM and special relativity that seem to prove the existence of such things are incorrect. If they aren&#039;t, then we shouldn&#039;t be able to trust logic and commonsense in relation to any other topic either.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Regarding your last paragraph.  I am on the fence.  For a long, long time I agreed with you completely, silently re-assuring myself that right was .. just right in the end.  Today I am faced with a number of completely unbelievable and unjust circumstances surrounding my life, and can see clearly that all TI&#039;s have been punished by this entity, despite being completely innocent. I&#039;m not sure comic relief is the answer.  I am of the opinion it is attempting to alter the future of humanity, whatever pretense it uses, its actions essentially remove TI&#039;s from productivity and from the gene pool.  It appears to literally be a new holocaust.At the same time, a great number of TI&#039;s do what we are doing, and attempt not only to understand what is really going on, but to help ameliorate the situation not only for ourselves, and the victim group, but also the world.  I&#039;m not sure if we have discussed it before, but I&#039;m fairly certain it has access to a time machine.  From my point of view, it didn&#039;t like what we &#034;did before.&#034; ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Re your last paragraph, the entity may want to pre-emptively give mind-control theories a bad reputation. It&#039;s already accomplished that to a great degree now. Most people seem to already have this notion that only complete nutjobs think they are being mind controlled. Any potential future investigators will be somewhat discouraged by the existing associations between mind control theories and what kind of people have proposed or supported such theories in the past. This is no different than delegitimising all nationalism by inventing and then demonising nazism.Re your first paragraph, schizophrenia is unknown to the historical record until a few centuries ago. That&#039;s not because someone invented the word only relatively recently. I think it&#039;s because this syndrome didn&#039;t exist until a few centuries ago. Of course, we have a bit of a dilemma here, in that blaming all serious mental illness on this entity is very likely to cause utter disbelief in professionals and pretty much anyone living in the modern era, while not doing that would give the impression that we&#039;re unaware of Occam&#039;s razor. Still, the fact remains that there exist reliable reports of a wide variety of paranormal and pathological phenomena that, taken together, create a picture of a very confusing world. And the most straightforward way to resolve all this confusion is to attribute these phenomena to one deceptive source.By the way, I think there&#039;s a great danger involved in this sort of knowledge becoming widespread. Just imagine what kind of crazy and/or bad things many people would start doing in an attempt to gain favor with this power if they believed it was essentially like Satan and that there was no punishment for evil actions, other than getting caught and so on. There&#039;s a lot of minor things you could do to make people&#039;s lives more difficult without risking serious consequences to yourself in a direct, obvious manner. A lot of people aren&#039;t rational enough to truly understand the idea behind the golden rule. Who knows what would happen if people started to believe that &#034;Satan&#034; exists but that there is no &#034;God&#034;. I personally think this entity is too knowledgeable to be essentially evil or at least sadistic, and too powerful to desire human servants except for purposes of comic relief, but how would any human communicate these ideas to the billions of IQ &#060; 100 humans?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t think all schizophrenia is caused by it, more likely it mimics symptoms of mental illness in order to hide its existence.  I couldn&#039;t even speculate as to the number of people who are unaware that their issues are caused by an external force, though.Meanwhile, why reveal itself at all, and then attempt to discredit the person its revealed itself to by making those around them believe their experiences are caused by mental illness?

					<description><![CDATA[Have you noticed that (if you ask) people always say they have a constant train of thought or some such running in the background all the time? One guy said to me the most difficult thing in the world is to still your mind for a moment. I&#039;ve read Buddhists saying that such background activity is normal, and I&#039;d faintly recall one of the purposes of meditation is learning to still your mind (although strictly speaking there is only one single purpose: enlightenment). I also seem to remember this activity was normal in my own brain in the past, but it disappeared a couple of years ago around the time of my first psychosis. I wonder whether that background activity is the normal state of the human mind, or something created by this entity as a veil to hide mind control and condition people into thinking they have no control over their minds anyway (in the supposedly natural state). You may have underestimated the lengths to which this entity goes to hide its existence. The sheer number of schizophrenics these days is another clue pointing toward that conclusion. What do you think?]]></description>
