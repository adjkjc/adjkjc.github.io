					<description><![CDATA[I had a somewhat similar experience, I believe the entity was trying to &#034;prove&#034; it could manipulate gravity.  In 2010, around the time that the gang-stalking stopped the first time, I &#034;fell asleep&#034; on the couch in the middle of the day.  Shortly after waking up, I went outside to call &#034;Mary,&#034; and while pacing in the garden (which I did often at the time when talking on my cell phone), a brand new bracelet I had bought fell right off my wrist.  At the time I thought someone had entered my home while I was &#034;forced&#034; to sleep, and removed one of the rods in the links, but it most likely wouldn&#039;t have lasted that long.  I imagine the same effect might be able to be achieved with static electricity, but I&#039;m not sure.  Around that time I had purchased a number of &#034;charms,&#034; some with magnets in them, stupidly thinking it they would interfere with whatever communication mechanism was being used.  Nearly all of them &#034;fell off&#034; within days of putting them on.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So, something odd happened today. I left my apartment to eat outside and buy some food. I noticed at some point that I forgot to take my cellphone: not an unusual thing to happen, and I didn&#039;t taking it with me, either. I always put it in the same pocket as my cards and some money when I remember to take it. There were the usual occasions when I had to use that pocket, and the cellphone clearly wasn&#039;t there. At one point, I wanted to check today&#039;s date, and of course the cellphone would&#039;ve been useful for that purpose. At another time, I checked that all my cards were in the pocket (something I don&#039;t usually do), and clearly the cellphone wasn&#039;t there. A couple of times I tapped on my pocket, and it was basically empty (except for the cards and the money), clearly no cellphone. Yet when I got back to my apartment, I noticed the cellphone in that very same pocket before I took my coat off, taking a lot of space as usual. There&#039;s no way I could have missed the fact it was in my pocket all those times that I handled the pocket during that trip. Unfortunately, I didn&#039;t think to make a call with it until I had put it back to where I usually keep it in the apartment, so I can&#039;t rule out hallucination. I guess there was my chance to prove the entity can teleport things (materialise and dematerialise them).]]></description>
