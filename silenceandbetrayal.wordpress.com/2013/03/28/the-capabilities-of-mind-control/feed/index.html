					<description><![CDATA[I remember at least a few times when it has flashed some insight in my mind for a few seconds, one time a simple but brilliant argument about some flaw in current psychiatry or something like that, then I immediately forget it and can&#039;t recall it in spite of my best efforts. Pretty annoying. I don&#039;t think I&#039;d be speculating too deeply if I said most psychiatrists are probably being mind controlled in some such fashion, at the least.The more I ascribe to mind control in general, the more I begin to &#034;get&#034; humans: libraries full of silly, trivial, or insane books so that the good stuff literally drowns among the dreck (mind control), dogmatic science (mind control), a badly aged education system where you won&#039;t learn anything most of the time or if you do you will forget it soon anyway without any harm to your future success (mind control), the consumerist system itself where the market value of work has been detached from public need, a system where the vast majority of work is strictly speaking pointless, wasteful, mindless, while some work that needs to be done isn&#039;t being done, ideologies that make no sense, religions that make no sense, social mores that make no sense, stupid old theories that lecturers still teach as if they weren&#039;t stupid old theories, stupid theories in general, philosophers arguing over the same imaginary problems for centuries, meds that don&#039;t work (yet are used by dozens of millions of people in the West), saturated fats being seen as unhealthy even though they are probably the healthiest source of energy, biological egalitarianism being a widely held belief among otherwise smart people even though an idea further removed from reality on all levels is difficult to conceive, etc. etc. I used to ascribe all that stuff to stupidity, greed, political motives, and conformism. I&#039;m not sure anymore that nature could produce a species that pathetic. I think there&#039;s some mind control involved there, probably.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Write it down, and read it every day.  FYI memory suppression is most definitely a weapon and mechanism of mind control.  I experience it also, unfortunately for me, the memories of my experiences with this entity are not suppressed, but rather highlighted.  It is the focus of my mind, against my will. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&#034;Conscious knowledge of the mind control allows for subjects to “second-guess” their own needs, feelings, desires,in order to at least hinder the ability of the program to covertly influence actions and beliefs.&#034;Feel-good optimistic propaganda, basically. I regularly go through periods of time (counted in minutes, sometimes perhaps even hours) where I&#039;ve completely forgotten that this entity talks to me hours every day. I&#039;m not even sure that&#039;s mind control, but it seems quite obvious to me that you can be kept, probably with zero added expense, in a state of mind where you&#039;re living as if nothing were wrong about the world, and making choices accordingly.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[So why do you think changing neuronal connections is necessary for complete mind control? I&#039;ve mentioned dreams two times now on different pages at your blog, yet you&#039;ve never commented on that. How do you explain thinking you live elsewhere or thinking and thinking you&#039;re another person in a dream? And if you explain it in a way that doesn&#039;t require changes in neuronal connections (as you obviously should), then why would you explain any mind control as requiring changes in neuronal connections (apart from extreme skills like I mentioned)? Don&#039;t you feel you&#039;d really have to address this sort of thing to be taken seriously? I think you may be avoiding the topic because on some level you realise that it means you don&#039;t really understand the mechanism of mind control at all, and that&#039;s something you don&#039;t want to admit, even to yourself.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[A colleague from the TI community wrote it, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/prometheus.locke&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Prometheus Locke&lt;/a&gt;.Norseen&#039;s death was not ruled foul play, though the &#034;family&#034; and friends have said it was due to a &#034;congenital defect.&#034;  His age makes that supposition a bit silly, along with the fact that his death came at a very inopportune time for mind control victims.The intent &#034;not to change connections,&#034; I believe, means not inadvertently changing something.  Neurons are re-used over and over, and changing a single connection to change how you feel about, say, wanting a tan; might effect not only how much sunscreen you put on, but also whether or not you travel halfway across the country to a beach.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[John Norseen was murdered, according to whom? I tried to google it, but didn&#039;t find any other such claim (except for one &#034;may have been killed&#034;). I don&#039;t know why the writer of that book would undermine his own credibility by making a claim about something he didn&#039;t witness, without at least explaining how he came to believe in his claim and whether he heard it from someone else, ideally naming his source(s). I wouldn&#039;t mind if it were just an idea, but it&#039;s presented as historical fact, so a lot of people will raise their eye brows at that point.Who is the writer, by the way?I think you both should give some more thought to the idea that mind control isn&#039;t limited in any meaningful sense by the &#034;requirement not to change [neural connections]&#034;. From what I&#039;ve experienced personally, the existence of mind control is not only incontestible, I can not only prove its existence easily as an intellectual exercise, I can also point out that, for example, during dreams the content of my head (including all associations and memories) can seem to be completely different from what they really are, and this without there being any need to rework the &#034;neural circuitry&#034;. When I wake up, I&#039;m normal in less than two seconds. People can even dream they are of the opposite sex and not notice anything unusual about that while dreaming.That pretty much demonstrates there&#039;s no meaningful limitation to mind control imposed by individual human neurology. The only practical limitation, apart from the capacity of the mind to hold information, would have to do with extreme skills like concert level piano playing. That sort of thing I don&#039;t believe can be induced without a lot of modification of the circuitry, so to speak. At least I&#039;ve never heard of any cases where such skills have allegedly been learned in a paranormal fashion. (Of course, that doesn&#039;t mean it can&#039;t be done, just that it would require much alteration, which the entity doesn&#039;t want to do as a rule.) If you don&#039;t like dreams as an example, here&#039;s another one, less interesting but perhaps relevant: I can think one word and mean another and still think that the word I thought meant what I intended (i.e. words and meanings can be separated). That doesn&#039;t normally happen, of course; I attribute these experiences to mind control entirely, and don&#039;t believe they exist without it. They make me think that the following is a more extreme version of the same phenomenon:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SchizophasiaYou could also argue that these people just babble something for no reason, without understanding what they are saying, but I don&#039;t think that&#039;s necessarily so.]]></description>
