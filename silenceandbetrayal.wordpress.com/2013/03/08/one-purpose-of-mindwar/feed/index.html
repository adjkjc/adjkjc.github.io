					<description><![CDATA[I disagree.  It appears to me that the entity causing this is using mind control to coerce many targets to put in the indelible written record stories of their victimization.  It could be to serve the purpose of discrediting them, but with the sheer volume of complainants I believe personally that its purpose is to help our future generations.  Many of us write books, many of us file complaints, and they will be there forever.  One day, it will be analyzed, I am sure.The following is reproduced from the other thread, I don&#039;t want to leave the part unanswered anywhere:Suicidal thoughts are most likely caused by the entity itself. I have spoken to many victims who feel the same way. Let me remind you that there are many victims of both gang stalking and &#034;V2K&#034; who eventually do get almost complete relief. Removing yourself from the equation, especially being a well educated and credible target, only hurts our cause. Together we can solve this problem, and make the world a better place for future generations. I would definitely counsel against euthanasia, if you do feel that way, I would, myself, prefer to seek psychiatric help rather than lose my ability to speak out against the injustice perpetrated on me. As I am researching, it appears that this entity has been using schizophrenia as a weapon/mechanism for hiding its existence for some time. I would not say that all cases are a result of it, however its high co-ocurrence with highly educated people, and late life onset, are neurological evidence that at least some cases may be caused by an external influence. Leaving our truth in the psychiatric record, that we believe it is externally caused and have personal evidence of as much, can only serve to help future generations.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[2) ADDENDUM: Even if I included photos of those articles, I could be accused of lying about how they were relevant to my life during the moments that I encountered them.

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve pondered writing an autobiography with the purpose of exposing mind control.Some problems:1) I&#039;d have to use the real names of people for anyone to trust anything I wrote, or to be able to verify anything at all. I doubt I&#039;d get the permission of the most important person in this story. I&#039;d also have to publish her birth date. If I didn&#039;t publish those things, then I can&#039;t immediately think of anything involving mind control in my own life that the readers could reasonably verify.2) I haven&#039;t been collecting evidence, so I&#039;d have to rely on my memory, although in some cases I might be able to include photo copies of news articles and such should I find them again. If I don&#039;t include such things, it will be the easiest thing in the world for critics to accuse me of having false memories. I&#039;m sure you&#039;ve heard of the false memory movement. They could also accuse me of hallucination.3) I feel like I&#039;d have to include everything to make a convincing case. But some stuff would be difficult to include, either legally (in addition to getting permissions to use real names), because it includes under-age people and sex or similar problematic subject matter. 4) Some material would be difficult to include because I would suffer emotionally if it became public. Yet such material would be very relevant to getting across the unbiased truth.5) If it were published, and I didn&#039;t conclude the book with a convincing statement to the effect that I have now recovered my sanity and no longer believe in mind control, I would likely be locked up in a mental institution. There might even be a new law introduced to decrease obstacles to forced medication. In my case, if such a law were passed, I would have to resign to the fate of being medicated for the rest of my life. Another, alternative scenario might occur: I would be accused of having faked my illness, and would be tried for fraud. I don&#039;t care to go into details, but I have good reason to believe that the entity has planned that as a possible path for me, depending on what I choose to do.6) I have severe doubts that it would be published by a proper publishing house, or that more than a handful of people would buy it if I self published. I have written a novel which I consider to be quite amusing and worthy of publication and moderate success. It&#039;s a light hearted fantasy novel. The only major fantasy publisher in my country commented that it had good qualities but didn&#039;t quite work as a whole. They didn&#039;t want to publish it. It&#039;s not conventional fantasy, so I&#039;ve sent it to just about every fiction publisher in my country. No responses beyond standardised rejection letters. I&#039;ve also been learning truths about various topics over the course of my life, and always had the desire to spread those truths. Without a few trivial exceptions, I have only encountered a disappoinment after disappointment. I don&#039;t know why this truth about mind control would be any different, except it would be even more difficult for people to accept in their natural, free state of mind.7) It&#039;s a distinct possibility that, even if I somehow became a celebrity as a result of this planned autobiography, it wouldn&#039;t have any measurable effect on anyone&#039;s life. Few people would believe my conclusions or most of what is in the book. Fewer still would bother to attempt to verify any of it, and these would be people of zero significance in the grand scheme of things. I would have caused sorrow, despair, and embarrassment about my life and sanity in the few people have remained important to me in my life. I would have got money I didn&#039;t need. Publicity I have no use for, and that I might learn to resent quite fast.To conclude, writing such a book, especially publishing it, doesn&#039;t seem like a wise decision.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is definitely an idea I&#039;ve gotten from the entity, also.  Transference, or in this case... the &#034;mark of the beast.&#034;  That is, it replaces or modifies what the public sees in order to cast what it would consider &#034;a true light&#034; on the subject.A good example is Michael Aquino&#039;s &#034;satanism,&#034; and his publicly known relationship to the NSA and mind control.  The stories of the Bohemian Grove fit well also.Of course, transference in this way is wrong, and while it&#039;s an interesting concept to ponder... why not just let the actual truth out.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve also seen them remember actual series of events in a way that they didn&#039;t happen, to protect their blind faith in the sanity of what they&#039;re doing (medicating, medicating, and medicating). The first time I took antipsychotics, they did nothing for me over an almost two month period. When I stopped taking them, however, the harassment ended. These people then speculated that the drug had finally started to have an effect just when I stopped using it. Is that something anyone but a mindless puppet would say? Then in other cases I&#039;ve come out of &#034;psychotic&#034; states BEFORE the meds could&#039;ve had an effect according to what they&#039;ve told me about how they work, or I&#039;ve recovered before I even started to take them. Now they&#039;re telling me it&#039;s those meds that have caused my recoveries in the past, so I&#039;m endangering myself due to not taking them to maintain my sanity. Seriously, how can you blame these people for anything? They&#039;re clearly out of their minds. I haven&#039;t even told you all the wrong predictions and nonsense and crap they&#039;ve said and done to me. It&#039;s like they live in their own alternative universe where what they hope to be true just so happens to be an inescapable conclusion for them regardless of overwhelming evidence against that conclusion. But these are two very sweet women, and as far as I can tell, they aren&#039;t stupid, and they certainly MEAN well.However, I think these are people who naturally tend to have blind faith in the system, in authority figures, and so on, so they are merely being helped to be what they already are. Their blindess is REVEALED to people like me through comical statements they wouldn&#039;t make without the entity. But this doesn&#039;t mean they would be some sort of revolutionaries without its influence. I think they are people who are either beneficial or harmful depending on whether the social system is beneficial or harmful. Because that&#039;s what they want to be: social, &#034;good people&#034; mainly in the superficial manner that conformists are &#034;good&#034;. Enough cognitive dissonance might wake them up though. Even such people may occasionally learn something.I don&#039;t see why the drug researchers or the FDA gate keepers would be any different, except they might have other less than noble motives. I don&#039;t see why the puny humans at the top of the monkey pyramid would be any different either, except again the motives. There are signs that their conspiracies and crimes are somewhat bungled so that, while the false flags seem to succeed to some extent, they also leave behind all sorts of clues of who the perpetrators were, and in the case of global warming, I&#039;d say that hoax is being discredited in a way that the ruling elite didn&#039;t expect. I&#039;ve seen a tendency that their crimes are being revealed. Some think they are being revealed to cause despair. I think they are being revealed to expose the fact that our current leaders are corrupt. Or perhaps they aren&#039;t even behind those crimes, such as Sandy Hook. Such events could happen because the West has become corrupt, and God is helping them express their true selves, from which at least some of us onlookers can learn something. Keep in mind that mindless violence and schizophrenia have both exploded in recent times, and correlate with the rise of materialism and human arrogance. I&#039;m amused by the thought that all that might be true. Imagine being the U.S. government or the so-called Illuminati or whatever. Imagine that every time some great crime happened there would suddenly be tons of evidence that YOU did it, even though you had no idea it would happen and zero reason for it to happen. Then you&#039;d figure out a way to possible benefit from the situation. That would further serve to give the impression you were responsible. LOL]]></description>

Imagine that every time some great crime happened there would suddenly be tons of evidence that YOU did it, even though you had no idea it would happen and zero reason for it to happen. Then you&#039;d figure out a way to possible benefit from the situation. That would further serve to give the impression you were responsible. LOL</p>
