					<description><![CDATA[Yes, that&#039;s what it looks like. But let&#039;s not forget you&#039;ve already admitted you can&#039;t rule out the virtual reality hypothesis. This means there could be rules and calculations going on in the background that we can never become aware of through the use of scientific instruments or the known senses. There could be souls, even virtual God, but we&#039;d have to infer their existence indirectly from anomalous phenomena.Even if we dismissed all that as far fetched, your statements haven&#039;t been proven yet. Neurology is in relative infancy. No one seems to know exactly how the mind arises from brain activity. It&#039;s true that the brain influences the mind, but the mind also influences the brain. You may be jumping to conclusions when you declare the victory of materialism. It&#039;s not that easy to solve age old metaphysical mysteries.I say that as someone with a background in philosophy. This background has contributed to my cynicism about human claims to final answers or metaphysical truths. Reading philosophy of science and observing today&#039;s scientists on various forums and media, I&#039;ve come to the conclusion they are mostly arrogant fools, with their child-like idea of scientific progress as consisting of a straightforward movement from primitive superstition toward ever more refined theory and bigger and bigger collection of experimental facts kept uncorrupted by the process of peer review.The truth is almost all progress has come from engineers and a few dissenting scientists while the establishment has historically always been wrong about everything they thought they knew. Unlike people think, it&#039;s not &#034;science&#034; we have to thank for progress, it&#039;s inventors, who as a rule create devices and technology despite theory rather than thanks to it. I suppose that might be hard to swallow for the survivors of the Western &#034;education&#034; system. It&#039;s the truth, though.This is partly why I don&#039;t give a damn if you say a theory proves something. It&#039;s just a theory. It doesn&#039;t prove anything. So if there are experiences that your theory doesn&#039;t explain, it&#039;s not the experiences that need revision, it&#039;s your theory that needs revision.P.S. I think most scientists think that the ability to acquire knowledge in the modern world depends primarily on intelligence. They don&#039;t seem to suspect it depends much more on a number of factors having to do mostly with actual personal experience in many cases. Factors that are important include spare time, energy, patience, luck, detachment, resistance to social pressure, ability to cope with shame and admit to yourself when you&#039;ve been wrong, ability to take any phenomenon seriously so you can coldly examine it, ability to accurately remember information you don&#039;t agree with, ability to perceive what you don&#039;t expect, and ability to compare paradigms as if you believed them all. As a general rule, the more you invest your identity in a belief, the less seriously anyone should take you, because you now have a strong psychological need to believe in a certain way. This why psychiatrists and career experts in general tend to be such sad failures as thinkers even in their own fields.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks.I have a suggestion if you don&#039;t mind. You could research and write a post about what you think are impossible (even for the entity to cause) but occasionally reported phenomena. This would give you as well as your readers a way to potentially falsify your theory. Some suggestions:A consciousness so expanded that the limits of the brain must have been exceeded. These experiences might include the mystic experience of &#034;knowing everything at once&#034;.Bending some sort of object by employing psychokinesis. It would be something you wouldn&#039;t be able to bend with your hands. This sort of thing has been reported by Clint Eastwood. Of course, as a famous actor, he is automatically suspect in some circles. Well, who knows. (Google Eastwood Geller interview. I&#039;m referring to the one published at the Reuters website. Search &#034;key&#034; to find the part I&#039;m talking about.)Materialisation &#038; dematerialisation. Well, I&#039;m not sure there are reports of thoroughly investigated materialisation cases, where there has been an attempt to rule out collective visual and tactile hallucination. Perhaps it&#039;d be ultimately impossible if the entity were determined to keep the deception intact. Dematerialisation should be easier to prove. Of course, there&#039;s the question of trustworthiness as always when you&#039;re not experiencing this stuff yourself.Alchemy by employing the power of the mind (seemingly). Stylianos Atteshlis reports this sort of thing (turning a plant into copper). I guess the same reservations apply as in the above. In any case, I&#039;ve googled a bit, and can&#039;t find anything but good stuff on Atteshlis. He seems to have healed quite a number of people during his lifetime, for free, as well as built a reputation, among those who knew him, of being a good man. While Uri Geller has been a target of attacks from people like James Randi, on the other hand Atteshlis is one of those who have been spared, even though three books have been written about him. I guess it&#039;s a bit hard to attack someone who doesn&#039;t even charge a fee for his services.Well, I&#039;d have a longer list but I no longer feel like including phenomena that can be dismissed as resulting from persistent hallucinations that are shared to some extent at the critical moments. E.g. an incurable disease that was cured thru psychic healing: the disease could have been a persistent hallucination, and also have been hallucinated by the healer and other witnesses and diagnosticians.I guess it just seems to me like you&#039;re betting a lot on the idea that humans are just biological machines who never needed paranormally sharp instincts to survive. I think there are unsolved mysteries too great for me to fully invest in that idea. Does anyone, for example, know what dark matter is? Or dark energy? Or how anything can exist? Or how come everything in this universe seems fine tuned to produce life? The most obvious answer to the last question especially requires the existence of some greater creator than your theory allows for.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[First, I do not believe humans have evolved to the point of having anyform of ESP or paranormal powers.  I do believe people have witnessed phenomenon like that, but explain it as the machinations of this external influence.  If my conjecture about entanglement is correct, and charge can be modified remotely using that phenomenon, it is a short jump to confering the gravity mediator aswell.I do believe that quantum phenomenon have some effect on neuron growth and firing, but that it is not significant in understanding cognitive function.  I think it is documented that EM fields can slightly increase the probability of a neuron firing, slightly.The suppression of an action potential, which is caused by a shift from negative to positive polarity due to ion movement across the cell membrane is fairly straightforward.  Simply keep the voltage below that required for the action potential to fire, and that pathway is suppressed.  This mechanism is conjecture, but I&#039;m fairly certain it works.. it&#039;s also possible the actual ion channels could be controlled, to ensure that ions could not flow into the cytoplasm.I do believe in full mind control.  My perception is that it does not exist, but if you take a step back both mechanically and functionally it appears to be what we are dealing with.  The issue of &#034;seeing it&#034; comes from our subconscious rationalization of the effects of mind control.  I believe that while we could probably be made to do anything, if the action is something you might do anyway, the brain (or perhaps the &#034;entity&#034;, or both) rationalizes a reason for you, and you believe it.On the other hand, if it were completely irrational, the brain may respond like Sirhan Sirhan&#039;s explanation, with something completely irrational that exposes mind control, as it did for him.I&#039;ve been contemplating writing a post called &#034;Arm Wrestling with Satan,&#034; which discussing exactly this issue.  I have never experienced being mind controlled to do anything that once I recognized, I could not stop.  This applies to physical actions (like arm movements), and also to much broader and less noticable mind control attacks.Recognizing that it is there might give you more control, but i am more inclined to think that belief could be an illusion.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You seem to have thought through this quantum stuff much more fully than I, so can you please respond to my questions? As far as Dean Radin is concerned, what he writes in his book, Entangled Minds, only makes me believe entanglement can&#039;t explain full mind control.You say that neurons can be fired by utilising entanglement, but how would that explain the suppression of certain memories? I&#039;m a believer in absolute mind control, so you&#039;d have to explain, not just how neurons are fired, but how they are made not to fire as well.I have a feeling that no technology will ever be able to fully control the mind from a distance. From what you&#039;ve written, I think you believe there is no full mind control anyway. But you seem to have contradicted yourself in the past, so I&#039;d like some further elaboration on this topic. Or are you saving this stuff for a new book?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[You may have misread me, when I started to talk about entanglement. I meant that your theory would make more sense in comparison to mine if we assumed that the human brain couldn&#039;t have evolved to use quantum entanglement in the way that the entity is supposed to do. Do you think the human brain couldn&#039;t have so evolved? I think that&#039;s what you think, but you didn&#039;t really address the question (you talked about EM instead). There is at least one well-known paranormal researcher who thinks the brain did probably evolve to use quantum stuff to accomplish ESP and such things (Dean Radin).Also, how do you explain telekinesis, the moving or bending of inanimate objects seemingly with the power of the mind? I&#039;m pretty sure this stuff exists, as I have some personal experiences indicating its existence. I&#039;m not absolutely certain though, but it does seem relatively well documented as a phenomenon.There are also cases of materialisations and dematerialisations that seem rather convincing as a whole. What would you say about that?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I do not believe we are dealing with an omnipotent power. I certainly would not blame the entity I am speaking of for *all* of humanity&#039;s mistakes. Just the ones that have furthered its goals as opposed to ours. However, things like racism and religious persecution do fall into this category. They keep humanity from uniting, and retarding the progress of our species may be one of this entities goals.

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I do not believe we are dealing with an omnipotent power. I certainly would not blame the entity I am speaking of for *all* of humanity&#039;s mistakes. Just the ones that have furthered its goals as opposed to ours. However, things like racism and religious persecution do fall into this category. They keep humanity from uniting, and retarding the progress of our species may be one of this entities goals.

					<description><![CDATA[I think we may have quite different ideas about the world that don&#039;t come to surface when we write about this stuff. For example, how do you explain multiculturalism? I mean the promotion of anti-white attitudes and values that goes by that name these days. I&#039;m really curious how you think that does anything for the entity. I guess I&#039;m just seeing the developments of the last couple of centuries as proof of ethnic competition and nothing more. My opinion on that isn&#039;t fixed, but at the same time I&#039;m not seeing any trends or developments that can&#039;t be fully explained from my Darwinistic perspective without assuming that the subconscious force cares about politics.You wrote somewhere that the entity saved Hitler at least once, implying Hitler had a destiny to fulfil. That would seem like a sign of interest in world politics on the part of the entity. But what if that story isn&#039;t true? The vast majority of books about history, especially about Hitler or other important topics, aren&#039;t exactly entirely reliable. A lot of them are complete BS as far as I can tell. Too many people think they can control the future by inventing aspects of the past, so that&#039;s what they do.Anyway, maybe you&#039;re right and it happened. But it could have been just something Hitler&#039;s subconscious mind wanted to do for some reason, without actually having a longterm plan. Even if it did have a longterm plan, doesn&#039;t mean that plan was shared by all other subconscious minds, or that it was a malicious plan, or that the subconscious mind was sure it would succeed or cared very much either way.I know your theory would seem more plausible on the face of it if we assumed that the human brain couldn&#039;t have evolved to employ quantum entanglement in the way you think the entity does. Because if we assumed that, then I&#039;d have to postulate a world beyond ours, an astral world of spirits or whatever to explain the powers of the subconscious mind, and perhaps I&#039;d also have to assume that it didn&#039;t evolve in the first place, that humans were spirits before they became creatures of matter.You might be able to say your theory assumes less for that reason, but you can&#039;t know there&#039;s no spirit world or at least subconscious minds that act and communicate through ways unknown to you. That said, I don&#039;t really buy your quantum entanglement explanation of all paranormal events seemingly involving psychic powers. What one can read from Wikipedia about the phenomenon seems to suggest that your claims about it are very unconventional. If you understood quantum entanglement well enough to claim what you&#039;ve claimed, and if while understanding, you would be able to make that claim truthfully, I don&#039;t see what&#039;d stop you from stunning at least a couple of qualified physicists. My impression is that experts on quantum mechanics are exceptionally open minded as a group, that is to say they aren&#039;t completely closed minded. You should be able impress at least a few of them and post about that here.]]></description>
