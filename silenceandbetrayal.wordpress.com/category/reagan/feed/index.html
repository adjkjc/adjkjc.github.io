										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, we have spent a significant amount of effort telling you all the bad things mind control can, and most probably is doing to you, and the world around you. &nbsp;It&#8217;s a sad state of affairs, in our mind, that such a powerful tool would be used by .. the powers that be .. to do something so awful to so many people. &nbsp;We&#8217;re not just talking about organized stalking, and the MK-Ultra style abuse that <i>is definitely</i>&nbsp;going on, but also about what we believe is a broad and uniform use of this technology in order to hide some very significant realities from the common people. &nbsp;It&#8217;s a little bit like <i>The Matrix</i>, we are all moving through the motions, going to work, going home, sleeping; however if you take a step back, there is something very nefarious going on &#8212; right under your nose. &nbsp;The problem we now face is: it&#8217;s not the movies, and we don&#8217;t have Keanu Reaves to save us.</p>
<p>The great dilemma of our time is that this mind control technology is being used to hide a great atrocity from you, the fact that this technology is not being used for your benefit, but instead to control you. &nbsp;I know it&#8217;s called mind control, but it could do so much more. &nbsp;There&#8217;s so many people aware of it&#8217;s use, and none of them are speaking out either, about the possible species changing gains it could help bring about, nor about the poor way it is currently being used. </p>
<p>Mind control technology, the kind being used by the governments of the world right now, has the capability to bring about a transhumanist metamorphosis of humanity, an evolutionary leap so great it would practically trump biological evolution in potential progress and benefit. &nbsp;It is <i>destiny changing, </i>if in the right hands.</p>
<p>Phillip K. Dick, who in my humble opinion, was clear recipient of a significant amount of mind control in his life &#8212; from a great amount of inspiration, to an attack of paranoia very similar to modern day gang-stalking. &nbsp;His prophetic works of art, however, offer our generation a glimpse into the possibilities we have before us, and a warning about the disaster the government has given you, against your will. &nbsp;In <i>A Scanner Darkly, </i>Dick describes a world where the government is watching us in a very similar manner to Orwell&#8217;s <i>1984</i>, and is using a very pervasive surveillance infrastructure in order to hide narcotics trafficking, and also in order to.. subvert the distribution of those narcotics. &nbsp;That reality, unfortunately, is very similar to the one that is being hidden from you, today. &nbsp;This is a reality that needs to change, very badly. &nbsp;This subversion has worked its way through the ranks of our Judicial system, to the point where most lawyers and &#8230; participants in that system will definitely personally admit, and might even tell you &#8212; our justice system <b><i>sucks.</i></b><br /><b><i><br /></i></b>Phillip K Dick, did give us a better alternative though. &nbsp;It might be an unpopular world-view now, but the system in place in <i>Minority Report</i>&nbsp;would do us all<i style="font-weight:bold;">&nbsp;alot</i>&nbsp;of good today. &nbsp;It was a world where crime could be mostly eliminated, either through the use of a time machine, or simply by <i>fixing our big problem.</i>&nbsp; What problem? &nbsp;Well, its been about greed and lust for power since the beginning, and nothing has changed now. &nbsp;Mind control could offer us a world where people were <i>better</i>, greed would be reduced, <i>love thy neighbor</i>&nbsp;would actually mean something, and our society might actually flourish without constant wars and hatred. &nbsp;Isaiah the Prophet talked about a Second Covenant with God, and this vision is very similar in substance. &nbsp;The Second Covenant he spoke of is most likely a plausible alternative to the tragedy of Revelation that so many people are either expecting or dreading in the coming.. well.. few weeks. &nbsp;James Cameron told us &#8220;the future is not written,&#8221; and lets all hope that we don&#8217;t deal with the very bleak future that was delivered in Revelation.</p>
<p>In <i>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep</i>, or as most of you probably know it <i>Bladerunner,&nbsp;</i>Dick told us of a world where people could control their own minds &#8212; almost like a TV remote, choosing emotions or feelings that they desired to have. &nbsp;This too, is well within our grasp, and <i>mind control</i>&nbsp;has the ability to increase content and happiness, at the push of a button. &nbsp;&#8220;Bliss on tap,&#8221; if you can hear Al Pacino saying it, in another popular film.</p>
<p>Mind control could make you happy doing your job, and more efficient doing it. &nbsp;We could actually live in a productive society, instead of the world of global stagnation and unemployment that lays before you.</p>
<p>It could make those with a dependence problem, simply not have one anymore. &nbsp;Conversely, in our current world, it appears that the government might actually be augmenting their narcotics trafficking business with a strange program of <i>increasing the desire of those in certain situations to want to harm themselves &#8212; against their will.</i></p>
<p>It could make those with neurological disorders, like Parkinson&#8217;s, Asberger&#8217;s, Alzheimer&#8217;s, and Schizophrenia&nbsp;<i>all better, instantly. &nbsp;</i>It could also completely remove pain from the lives of pretty much anyone. &nbsp;Instead of &#8230; giving a sitting American President a neurological disease, so that another one can <i>sell narcotics.</i></p>
<p>It could significantly increase tactile stimulation (I&#8217;m trying to be PG-13 here).</p>
<p>And if you are a computer scientist like me, you might enjoy an actual BCI &#8212; Brain Computer Interface &#8212; never lose your TV remote again, and type at the speed of thought&#8230;</p>
<p>Which could be <i>thousands</i>&nbsp;of times faster! &nbsp;Mind control could make <i>everyone</i>&nbsp;smarter. &nbsp;Faster thoughts, better memories, and instant access to new and correct knowledge. &nbsp;It could eliminate the need for <i>studying</i>&nbsp;and download information directly into the cerebral cortex. &nbsp;<i>Instead of intentionally making the population stupid.</i></p>
<p>And last, but not least, it could actually create <b>Peace on Earth and Goodwill Towards Men</b><i><b>, </b>thank you Kermit and Sneakers, I would never forget you. </i>&nbsp;Instead of increasing support and decreasing dissent relating to series of Unholy Wars that resulted from a false flag attack on U.S. soil.</p>
<p>If nothing else, I sincerely hope that I have convinced you, today, that Philip K. Dick was <i>inspired</i>&nbsp;by something outside himself &#8212; it should be obvious now.</p>
<p>In reality, what I really hope you take away from this is that something very big is being hidden from you, and its being used very improperly. &nbsp;Our species is at a crossroads, let&#8217;s not choose to be <i>slaves to cocaine, oil and secrecy</i>&nbsp;for eternity.</p>
<p>Maybe we should call it <b style="font-style:italic;">mind assistance,&nbsp;</b>and forget about all the silly control business<b style="font-style:italic;">.</b></p>
