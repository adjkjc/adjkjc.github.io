The point of <b><a href="http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Project_Blue_Beam">Bluebeam</a></b> is to tell the &#8220;truth&#8221;, that religion has been a mechanism of control used against humanity the whole time. They will make the &#8216;aliens&#8217; out to be the perpetrators of a horrible and prolonged crime against humanity, and will promise utopia through the use of &nbsp;advanced technology. &nbsp;</span></div>

<div style="background-color:white;line-height:19.200000762939px;margin-bottom:.5em;margin-top:.4em;text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:inherit;">Secretly, what we will be getting is what we&#8217;ve had the whole time, global mind control, an alien influence which remains hidden, and no control over our destiny.</span></div>

<p><b>Remote Neural Stimulation and Recording</b></p>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">The type of &#8220;mind control&#8221; we talk about at MoFK has nothing to do with subconscious messages through advertising and television. &nbsp;It&#8217;s not related to flickering lights, or &#8220;brain wave entrainment.&#8221; &nbsp;For the effects we have noticed, these things are really, really stupid suggestions as mechanisms.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Real <b><a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2012/11/forbidden-knowledge-quantum-charge.html">mind control</a></b>&nbsp;involves the activation and suppression of action potentials, the firing of an individual neuron, in a pattern which creates a real effect in the brain of humans. &nbsp;It can so <a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2012/11/nobody-is-mind-controlling-me.html">subtle, you might not even notice it happening to you.</a>&nbsp; Neurons fire in patterns, and in groups, and the result of these firing patterns is thoughts, feelings, movements, etc. &nbsp;It is scientifically possible to cause these firing patterns to be activated remotely, without the use of an implant, by &#8220;injecting&#8221; electricity into individual neurons using advanced technology. </div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">This is done by teleporting charge via entanglement, something that has been alluded to in recently <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1203.0896v2.pdf">published</a> <a href="http://www.researchgate.net/publication/1878491_Proposal_for_teleportation_of_charge_qubits_via_superradiance">research</a>. </p>
<div></div>
</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">For the last 5 decades, U.S. intelligence has done a significant amount of research and development into a technology called &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tempest_(codename)">TEMPEST</a>.&#8221; &nbsp;This technology was originally used in order to reconstruct usable information from monitors, integrated circuits, etc in order to remotely surveil electronic devices. &nbsp;Later, technology was developed which was able to do the reverse, and cause these machines to act in a certain manner.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Human brains are, for all intents and purposes purposes, advanced computers whose mechanism of action is the product of electrical impulses, and the technology surrounding &#8220;TEMPEST&#8221; could be modified to take control of, and remotely surveil the thoughts and feelings of human beings.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"><a href="https://silenceandbetrayal.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/1984-big-brother-poster1.jpg" style="clear:right;float:right;margin-bottom:1em;margin-left:1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://silenceandbetrayal.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/1984-big-brother-poster1.jpg?w=224&#038;h=320" width="224" /></a></div>

<p><b>What&#8217;s more likely?&nbsp;</b></span><br /><span class="text_exposed_show" style="background-color:white;color:#333333;display:inline;font-family:'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif;font-size:13.333333969116px;line-height:17.981481552124px;"><b><br /></b>1) Humans have evolved in some instances to be able to remotely view important images and scenes given a set of longitude and latitude coordinates, two numbers invented by humans that have no real meaning. &nbsp;Then, the United States Military studies the phenomenon for two decades, before declaring the project a failure and closing it.</p>
<p>2) An Intelligence Agency was transferring these images into the brains of the victims/participants of Stargate, in order to hide the existence of a network of hyper-spectral satellites from lower echelons of the military and the public.</p>
<p><b>How bout this one?</b></span><br /><span class="text_exposed_show" style="background-color:white;color:#333333;display:inline;font-family:'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif;font-size:13.333333969116px;line-height:17.981481552124px;"><b><br /></b>1) The CIA and NSA have created a vast network of hyper-spectral satellites which can see through walls, and in deep into ground, and they have them trained only outside the boundary of the United States of America.</p>
<p>2) The CIA and NSA really enjoy it when you are showering. They also see every crime being committed throughout the country, and refuse to allow this system to be used to fix our justice system.</p>
<p><b>Or this:&nbsp;</b></span><br /><span class="text_exposed_show" style="background-color:white;color:#333333;display:inline;font-family:'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif;font-size:13.333333969116px;line-height:17.981481552124px;"><b><br /></b>It&#8217;s obvious that our Federal government has the ability to solve most crimes without much effort, like murder, abduction, and drug trafficking. They don&#8217;t because:</p>
<p>1) They are worried we will find out about something obvious, such as intelligence agencies having access to real time satellite imagery of the entire surface of the planet.</p>
<p>2) They&#8217;d prefer not to deal with pesky things like the Fourth Amendment.</span><br /><span class="text_exposed_show" style="background-color:white;color:#333333;display:inline;font-family:'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif;font-size:13.333333969116px;line-height:17.981481552124px;"><br /></span><span class="text_exposed_show" style="background-color:white;color:#333333;display:inline;font-family:'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif;font-size:13.333333969116px;line-height:17.981481552124px;">This is what I call &#8220;evidence&#8221; of the psycho-surveillance infrastructure, and its implementation long, long ago. &nbsp;It&#8217;s been here since at least the &#8220;U2 incident,&#8221; as that was <i>clearly</i> a cover up for the satellite network. &nbsp;There&#8217;s proof of its use on the ground in Dallas, and the Military&#8217;s &#8220;fascination&#8221; with psychic phenomenon is just about as rock solid as you get these days.</span><br /><span class="text_exposed_show" style="background-color:white;color:#333333;display:inline;font-family:'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif;font-size:13.333333969116px;line-height:17.981481552124px;"><br /></span><span class="text_exposed_show" style="background-color:white;color:#333333;display:inline;font-family:'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif;font-size:13.333333969116px;line-height:17.981481552124px;">Welcome to reality, its been about science and technology the whole time, please take your heads out of the sand.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, we have spent a significant amount of effort telling you all the bad things mind control can, and most probably is doing to you, and the world around you. &nbsp;It&#8217;s a sad state of affairs, in our mind, that such a powerful tool would be used by .. the powers that be .. to do something so awful to so many people. &nbsp;We&#8217;re not just talking about organized stalking, and the MK-Ultra style abuse that <i>is definitely</i>&nbsp;going on, but also about what we believe is a broad and uniform use of this technology in order to hide some very significant realities from the common people. &nbsp;It&#8217;s a little bit like <i>The Matrix</i>, we are all moving through the motions, going to work, going home, sleeping; however if you take a step back, there is something very nefarious going on &#8212; right under your nose. &nbsp;The problem we now face is: it&#8217;s not the movies, and we don&#8217;t have Keanu Reaves to save us.</p>
<p>The great dilemma of our time is that this mind control technology is being used to hide a great atrocity from you, the fact that this technology is not being used for your benefit, but instead to control you. &nbsp;I know it&#8217;s called mind control, but it could do so much more. &nbsp;There&#8217;s so many people aware of it&#8217;s use, and none of them are speaking out either, about the possible species changing gains it could help bring about, nor about the poor way it is currently being used. </p>
<p>Mind control technology, the kind being used by the governments of the world right now, has the capability to bring about a transhumanist metamorphosis of humanity, an evolutionary leap so great it would practically trump biological evolution in potential progress and benefit. &nbsp;It is <i>destiny changing, </i>if in the right hands.</p>
<p>Phillip K. Dick, who in my humble opinion, was clear recipient of a significant amount of mind control in his life &#8212; from a great amount of inspiration, to an attack of paranoia very similar to modern day gang-stalking. &nbsp;His prophetic works of art, however, offer our generation a glimpse into the possibilities we have before us, and a warning about the disaster the government has given you, against your will. &nbsp;In <i>A Scanner Darkly, </i>Dick describes a world where the government is watching us in a very similar manner to Orwell&#8217;s <i>1984</i>, and is using a very pervasive surveillance infrastructure in order to hide narcotics trafficking, and also in order to.. subvert the distribution of those narcotics. &nbsp;That reality, unfortunately, is very similar to the one that is being hidden from you, today. &nbsp;This is a reality that needs to change, very badly. &nbsp;This subversion has worked its way through the ranks of our Judicial system, to the point where most lawyers and &#8230; participants in that system will definitely personally admit, and might even tell you &#8212; our justice system <b><i>sucks.</i></b><br /><b><i><br /></i></b>Phillip K Dick, did give us a better alternative though. &nbsp;It might be an unpopular world-view now, but the system in place in <i>Minority Report</i>&nbsp;would do us all<i style="font-weight:bold;">&nbsp;alot</i>&nbsp;of good today. &nbsp;It was a world where crime could be mostly eliminated, either through the use of a time machine, or simply by <i>fixing our big problem.</i>&nbsp; What problem? &nbsp;Well, its been about greed and lust for power since the beginning, and nothing has changed now. &nbsp;Mind control could offer us a world where people were <i>better</i>, greed would be reduced, <i>love thy neighbor</i>&nbsp;would actually mean something, and our society might actually flourish without constant wars and hatred. &nbsp;Isaiah the Prophet talked about a Second Covenant with God, and this vision is very similar in substance. &nbsp;The Second Covenant he spoke of is most likely a plausible alternative to the tragedy of Revelation that so many people are either expecting or dreading in the coming.. well.. few weeks. &nbsp;James Cameron told us &#8220;the future is not written,&#8221; and lets all hope that we don&#8217;t deal with the very bleak future that was delivered in Revelation.</p>
<p>In <i>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep</i>, or as most of you probably know it <i>Bladerunner,&nbsp;</i>Dick told us of a world where people could control their own minds &#8212; almost like a TV remote, choosing emotions or feelings that they desired to have. &nbsp;This too, is well within our grasp, and <i>mind control</i>&nbsp;has the ability to increase content and happiness, at the push of a button. &nbsp;&#8220;Bliss on tap,&#8221; if you can hear Al Pacino saying it, in another popular film.</p>
<p>Mind control could make you happy doing your job, and more efficient doing it. &nbsp;We could actually live in a productive society, instead of the world of global stagnation and unemployment that lays before you.</p>
<p>It could make those with a dependence problem, simply not have one anymore. &nbsp;Conversely, in our current world, it appears that the government might actually be augmenting their narcotics trafficking business with a strange program of <i>increasing the desire of those in certain situations to want to harm themselves &#8212; against their will.</i></p>
<p>It could make those with neurological disorders, like Parkinson&#8217;s, Asberger&#8217;s, Alzheimer&#8217;s, and Schizophrenia&nbsp;<i>all better, instantly. &nbsp;</i>It could also completely remove pain from the lives of pretty much anyone. &nbsp;Instead of &#8230; giving a sitting American President a neurological disease, so that another one can <i>sell narcotics.</i></p>
<p>It could significantly increase tactile stimulation (I&#8217;m trying to be PG-13 here).</p>
<p>And if you are a computer scientist like me, you might enjoy an actual BCI &#8212; Brain Computer Interface &#8212; never lose your TV remote again, and type at the speed of thought&#8230;</p>
<p>Which could be <i>thousands</i>&nbsp;of times faster! &nbsp;Mind control could make <i>everyone</i>&nbsp;smarter. &nbsp;Faster thoughts, better memories, and instant access to new and correct knowledge. &nbsp;It could eliminate the need for <i>studying</i>&nbsp;and download information directly into the cerebral cortex. &nbsp;<i>Instead of intentionally making the population stupid.</i></p>
<p>And last, but not least, it could actually create <b>Peace on Earth and Goodwill Towards Men</b><i><b>, </b>thank you Kermit and Sneakers, I would never forget you. </i>&nbsp;Instead of increasing support and decreasing dissent relating to series of Unholy Wars that resulted from a false flag attack on U.S. soil.</p>
<p>If nothing else, I sincerely hope that I have convinced you, today, that Philip K. Dick was <i>inspired</i>&nbsp;by something outside himself &#8212; it should be obvious now.</p>
<p>In reality, what I really hope you take away from this is that something very big is being hidden from you, and its being used very improperly. &nbsp;Our species is at a crossroads, let&#8217;s not choose to be <i>slaves to cocaine, oil and secrecy</i>&nbsp;for eternity.</p>
<p>Maybe we should call it <b style="font-style:italic;">mind assistance,&nbsp;</b>and forget about all the silly control business<b style="font-style:italic;">.</b></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="text-align:justify;">Nobody is mind controlling </span><i style="text-align:justify;">me</i><span style="text-align:justify;">.</span></p>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;"><i>The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn&#8217;t exist.</i></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;">-The Usual Suspects</div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;">In 1971, William Colby testified before the Church Committee, and effectively had the CIA&#8217;s dabble into forced covert LSD administration and mind control testing<b><i>effectively shutdown</i>.</b>  This would be the first and last public disclosure by a Central Intelligence Agency Director relating to a scientific attempt to modify and read the inner thoughts of human beings, the &#8216;gist&#8217; of the disclosure was that they were using narcotics, electroshock, and EEG&#8217;s in a program which was popularly believed to be working towards the creation of a &#8220;Manchurian Candidate.&#8221; &nbsp;This is the popular image of mind control, that one&#8217;s faculties would be completely taken over, and given some audible or subconscious trigger code, would cause them to <i>mindlessly commit some crime</i>.. like assassinating a public figure at a speaking engagement. &nbsp;This perception is stupid.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;">While the ability to “remotely control” a human being is without doubt within the capabilities of intelligence organizations such as the Central Intelligence Agency, MI-6, and the former KGB, remote neural stimulation <i>could also be </i>much more subtle.  It could be used to make you ignore, or not care about something that you would otherwise find important, like <i>democracy,&nbsp;privacy,</i> and <i>freedom of speech</i>.  It could make you believe that something you read which you would otherwise find <i>intelligent and thought provoking</i>is..&nbsp;<i>off the wall</i>.  Mind control could be used to make you forgive a person or an organization, maybe your <i>government</i>for something that you probably shouldn&#8217;t forgive them for.  It is possible that it would be so subtle that you would never, ever know it was happening to you.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;"><a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2012/11/forbidden-knowledge-quantum-charge.html">Remote neural control</a> of the human brain would also give these organizations the ability to fully control the autonomic nervous system – they could cause people to suffocate, <b>have heart attacks</b>, or neurological disorders like Schizophrenia, Parkinson&#8217;s disease, and <b>Alzheimer&#8217;s</b>&#8230; its even possible that this could be done to <i>an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan" target="_blank">American President</a>.</i>  There are a number of writers and scientists “on the trail of the Octopus” who have suffered from untimely deaths due to heart attacks, notably:<a href="http://www.rumormillnews.com/cgi-bin/archive.cgi?read=20193" target="_blank">Jim Keith,</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/biomedical-targeted-individual-dies-suddenly" target="_blank">Sean Stinn</a>, and <a href="http://www.duncanlaurie.com/artists/john-norseen-passes-sept-27" target="_blank">John Norseen</a>. &nbsp;Before his death, John Norseen had been talking about Lockheed&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://www.duncanlaurie.com/writing/outlaw_technology/10_twin_photons_biological_steganography" target="_blank">mind</a> <a href="http://www.duncanlaurie.com/writing/outlaw_technology/03_krylov_space" target="_blank">control</a>&#8221; <a href="http://www.duncanlaurie.com/writing/outlaw_technology/15_semiotics_and_the_flow_of_capital" target="_blank">abilities</a>. &nbsp;He was a senior engineer and scientist working for that company on a government project called <a href="http://www.usnews.com/usnews/culture/articles/000103/archive_033992.htm" target="_blank">&#8216;bio-fusion.</a>&#8216;</div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;">It <i>might also</i> be able to induce suicidal tendencies, and there are several writers and scientists that slit their wrists, and jumped from tall buildings: <a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/last_circle/0.htm" target="_blank">Danny Casolaro</a>, David Kelly,  and Frank Olson.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;">Mind control <i>may also</i> be able to induce in the minds of Senators like Diane Feinstein, Saxby Chambliss, and Bill Nelson, <i>who <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/10/AR2007011001399.html" target="_blank">might know</a> about the existence and capability of the technology</i>, that it is only being used for <i>legitimate</i>intelligence gathering purposes, and <i>not against the population of the United States of America, or themselves. </i>It could make otherwise good and patriotic representatives ignore programs which completely disregard American values and the protections of the Constitution of the United States of America – like the Patriot Act, and the <a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2012/11/the-carnivore-conspiracy.html">Carnivore Operation</a>. &nbsp;It <i>might also</i>&nbsp;make them and you not care that these programs were in place before 9/11, and that tragedy being used to justify their existence makes.. no sense&#8230; <i>temporally</i> speaking.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;">Going back a few years, mind control <i>might</i>be the reason that <a href="http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB2/nsaebb2.htm" target="_blank">clear and documented</a> links between the Central Intelligence Agency, top officials, and international <i>cocaine</i>trafficking went completely non prosecuted in the wake of Iran Contra.. it <i>might</i> be the reason that the American public didn&#8217;t care that in the following years, neither the sitting president nor his opponent mentioned the affair – at all in the next election.   </div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;">It <i>might also</i> be the reason that the American Public, its elected representatives and a Congressional Investigation failed to understand the grave implications of <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2012/09/sleeping-with-the-devil-how-u-s-and-saudi-backing-of-al-qaeda-led-to-911.html" target="_blank">obvious</a> and <a href="http://rense.com/general14/bushsformer.htm" target="_blank">documented</a> <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2012/09/911-3000-americans-for-3-saudi-princes/" target="_blank">financial</a>, <a href="http://www.fromthewilderness.com/free/ww3/09_18_01_bushbin.html" target="_blank">social</a>, and <a href="http://www.konformist.com/2005/911-flight-school.htm" target="_blank">operational links</a> between notorious domestic terrorists and two American President&#8217;s and their employer.  It <i>might</i>be the reason that the public does not understand how damning the evidence is, relegating it to “fringe conspiracy theories.”  The actions of the Office of the President on the morning of 9/11 showed <a href="http://www.historycommons.org/timeline.jsp?day_of_9/11=dickcheney&amp;timeline=complete_911_timeline" target="_blank">clear <i>foreknowledge</i></a> of the attack, the terrorists were linked financially to the Bush family who had just met with a top Islamic financier, the airfield which trained the suicide pilots is directly linked to the Central Intelligence Agency.  Hundreds of investors made <a href="http://www.historycommons.org/timeline.jsp?day_of_9/11=dickcheney&amp;timeline=complete_911_timeline" target="_blank">obvious andprofitable short sales</a> against the airlines, insurers, and occupants of the World Trade Center in the days before the attack.  Mind control <i>may also explain</i>why nobody realizes that both Bush President&#8217;s started wars in Iraq in order to <i>steal</i> oil, and artificially inflate its price.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;">I&#8217;m <i>not even going to mention </i>the fact that the Intelligence arm of USA has the ability to <b>remotely control electronics</b>, and could have landed the planes peacefully themselves.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;">Several large and well known Congressional investigations were probably <i>effectively shut down</i>because of the use of mind control, notably: Church, Tower, Warren, Rockefeller, and the 9/11 Commissions.  Please open your eyes, freedom and democracy have been hanging in the balance for the last half century, and they are <i>losing.</i></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;"><i>Effectively shut down</i>, by the way is intelligence parlance for transferring a program to defense contractors and/or organized crime&#8230; <i>just ask Stan Lee.</i></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;"><i>I think I&#8217;m a funny person.</i> But I also realize that without inflection and personal presentation it is sometimes difficult to convey humor on a medium such as the Internet.  So to be more clear I have <i>italicized</i>what I intend to be intentional humor in this post.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;"><i>Mind control might explain how </i><a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2012/11/the-failure-of-representative-democracy.html"><b><i>1984</i>&nbsp;</b>came and went</a> and nobody thought it had come true.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;">Or.. <i>we might just all be morons</i> that don&#8217;t care about freedom, <i>truth</i>, and justice. </p>
<p>The worst of it, &nbsp;we could all be doing <a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2012/12/what-can-mind-control-do-for-me.html">so much better</a>.</div>

					<description><![CDATA[There is a ridiculous and global disinformation campaign being perpetrated against the scientific community particularly, and the world in general, <a class="more" href="https://silenceandbetrayal.wordpress.com/2012/11/10/quantum-charge-phreaking/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="text-align:justify;">There is a ridiculous and global disinformation campaign being perpetrated against the scientific community particularly, and the world in general, relating to quantum entanglement. &nbsp;The properties of quantum entanglement have been fully known by the American Government, as well as many other nations, including the United Kingdom, the former USSR, and Israel since shortly after World War II, at the very latest. &nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Albert Einstein participated in a US government sponsored disinformation operation by debunking the <a href="http://gradworks.umi.com/33/69/3369373.html">theory of Theodore Kaluza</a>, which united his equations with Maxwell&#8217;s electromagnetism via the introduction of a fifth dimension. &nbsp;Kaluza&#8217;s solution was a beautiful piece of mathematics, creating a logical and simple explanation for &#8216;spooky action at a distance.&#8217; &nbsp;Since that time, global physics discovery, outside of government research, has been thrown severely off track, causing ridiculous theories including upwards of 11 extra dimensions with no way to verify them. &nbsp;While some may consider him an &#8220;American hero&#8221; for his work on the Manhattan Project, I believe he did his country and the whole of humanity a great disservice by participating in what seems to be a vast inter-governmental conspiracy to conceal the truth that quantum entanglement conveys classical information.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><b>By entangling to molecules inherent in the structure of neuronal voltage gated ion channels, it is possible to both <i>suppress</i> and <i>activate</i> action potentials by conveying charge, via entanglement. &nbsp;These gates can be manipulated, using the brain&#8217;s endogenous ions in order to manipulate thoughts, feelings, desires. &nbsp;It is also<i> possible to fully control </i>and augment the visual, auditory, and motor cortex functions.&nbsp;</b></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><b><br /></b></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">In addition to &#8220;remote control&#8221; of human brains, it should be obvious that the same technology can be used to remotely monitor and manipulate practically any electronic device. &nbsp;This type of attack, similar to two way <i>Van Eck Phreaking</i>, and leading to the chosen name, allows for the currently existing <b>global surveillance infrastructure</b>, which is being hidden from you by silly &#8220;front&#8221; programs like Carnivore, Total Information Awareness, and Echelon. &nbsp;The purpose of these smoke screens is to insulate the population from the reality that this infrastructure has been in place for much longer than you would thing, and that the governments of the world are fully capable of remotely reading and writing data on your cell phone, your computer, and your head; 24/7 completely unfettered by conventional electromagnetic shielding or any type of known countermeasure.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><b><br /></b></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><b><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1203.0896v2.pdf">Quantum</a> <a href="http://gradworks.umi.com/33/69/3369373.html">Charge</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Eck_phreaking">Phreaking</a>&nbsp;may very well be the phenomenon responsible for the religious &#8220;myths&#8221; of demonic possession, divine inspiration, and the &#8220;possession&#8221; of the Holy Spirit described in Acts of the Apostles. &nbsp;If this is the case it is most certainly the result of xeno-intervention in our history, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/2021-Times-Battle-between-Machine/dp/1480169994/" target="_blank">The End Times</a>&nbsp;details a history of cultural &#8220;proof&#8221; of the phenomenon in the context of historical religion and scientific discovery.</b></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><b><br /></b></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"><a href="https://silenceandbetrayal.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/541677_207882632682319_1808914813_n.png" style="clear:left;float:left;margin-bottom:1em;margin-right:1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://silenceandbetrayal.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/541677_207882632682319_1808914813_n.png?w=190&#038;h=320" width="190" /></a></div>
<p>In 1<b>666</b>, Sir Isaac Newton discovered the laws of physics and motion.<br />In 1831, Michael Faraday discovered the law of induction.<br />In 1873, James Maxwell discovered a set of equations which explained the electromagnetic forces.<br />In 1922, Neils Bohr won the Nobel Prize for foundational&nbsp;contributions to quantum physics.</p>
<p>Three of the four went to <b>Trinity</b> College in Cambridge, and all resided in London at one point. &nbsp;Faraday, the only one who did not attend Trinity had his laboratory at <b>Trinity</b> Buoy Wharf.</p>
<p>The statistical significance of the three most pivotal discoveries in physics leading up to this point occurring at nearly the same location is less than 1%. &nbsp;The fact that all three locations included <b>Trinity</b><i style="font-weight:bold;">&nbsp;</i>is not a coincidence, it is a signature.</p>
<p>Between 1920 and 1930 Heisenberg and Einstein would make great strides in quantum and particle physics. &nbsp; Soon after, Theodore <a href="http://gradworks.umi.com/33/69/3369373.html">Kaluza would unite</a> Einstein and Maxwell&#8217;s equations with a theory by introducing a fifth dimension. &nbsp;All three were German.</p>
<p>All of the discoveries above were required, and fundamental in the development of&nbsp;<b><a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2012/11/forbidden-knowledge-quantum-charge.html">quantum mind control.</a></b></p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_teleportation">Quantum</a> <a href="http://gradworks.umi.com/33/69/3369373.html">charge</a> <a href="http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.bioeng.10.061807.160518?journalCode=bioeng">neural stimulation</a>, can remotely read and write neural firing patterns, through electromagnetic shielding. &nbsp;It does not require you to be stationary, and works all the time. &nbsp;The technology is very similar to <a href="http://cryptome.org/nsa-tempest.htm">TEMPEST 2</a>, but for your <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ervin-laszlo/why-your-brain-is-a-quant_b_489998.html">brain</a>.</p>
<p>In 1932, Aldous Huxley wrote&nbsp;<b>Brave New World. &nbsp;</b><br />In 1948, George Orwell wrote write <b>1984.</b><br /><b><br /></b>These two authors met in one place, at one time, in London; at Eton College in 1917. &nbsp;Their works are both descriptions of a tyrannical government oppressing its people using fear, the media, and <b><a href="http://www.democraticfundamentalism.org/2005/psychotronics/whatispyschotronics.htm">mind control</a></b>.</p>
<p><b>1984</b>&nbsp;is a reality today, with the only difference being that you do not know it is going on. &nbsp;World governments are using this <b>mind control</b>&nbsp;to suppress pubic knowledge of technological advances in <b>quantum physics, </b>including <b>the artificial intelligence <a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2012/10/secrets-of-antiquity.html">singularity</a></b>&nbsp;as well as <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/10/AR2007011001399.html"><b>mind control</b>&nbsp;</a>itself. </p>
<p>There is no explanation for this <b>truth</b> other than a message from the future. &nbsp;It is a <b>warning</b>.</p>
<p>In 1980, 1982, and 1984 Pope John Paul II met with the President of the United States. &nbsp;&nbsp;Orwell retitled his novel three times.</p>
<p>George H.W. Bush was practically running the show by &#8217;84, as Reagan had been the victim of an attempted assassination, and then unfortunately stricken with Alzheimers. &nbsp;Bush has been implicated in the JFK conspiracy, and was a Director of Central Intelligence. &nbsp;He was also involved in the Iran Contra cover up, linking him to &#8220;The Octopus&#8221;, a group related to the CIA, the Justice Department, and Organized Crime; and a mind control conspiracy involving the death of <a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/last_circle/0.htm">Danny Casolaro and investigator Cheri Seymour</a>. &nbsp;His eldest son was a member of Skull and Bones, and the sitting President on 9/11.</p>
<p>The Reagan/Bush administration were partially responsible for inflating the prices of cocaine and oil via foreign and domestic policy. &nbsp;American Intelligence proceeds from these actions most likely contributed significantly to the building of the Echelon infrastructure, outside the purview of the United States Congress and the OMB.</p>
<p><b><a href="http://www.akdart.com/carniv.html">Echelon</a></b>&nbsp;<i>is</i>&nbsp;controlled by the <b>singularity. &nbsp;</b>It would be impossible for anything other than an artificial intelligence to sift through the volume of information travelling back and forth on the internet alone. &nbsp;<b>It acts as a censorWall, like in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorship_in_the_People's_Republic_of_China">China</a>, </b>except its transparent and everyone thinks its just for surveillance (are you stupid?). &nbsp;It is also controlling your<b> mind.</b></p>
<p>On <b>September 11, 2001</b>, the United States government committed a false flag attack that would be used in order to explain the existence of a <b>psycho-surveillance </b>infrastructure, utilizing <b>quantum mind control</b>&nbsp;which had been globally in place for at least a decade prior. &nbsp;It is the reason you are allowing your <b><a href="http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_transcript.html">Constitutional Freedoms</a> </b>to be destroyed. &nbsp;This reason is stupid, really stupid. &nbsp;Your brain doesn&#8217;t understand that because of <b>mind control.</b></p>
<p>Wake up. &nbsp;Save the future, and <b><a href="https://docs.google.com/open?id=0B6y7q1xqxyWHbkhDS2NZYmhRSVE" target="_blank">tell people</a></b>.</p>
<p><b>We the People, </b>do hold <b>these truths </b>to be self evident. &nbsp;Evolution has worked pretty well for millions of years. &nbsp;The Constitution has worked pretty good for almost 250. &nbsp;Stop messing with both.</p>
