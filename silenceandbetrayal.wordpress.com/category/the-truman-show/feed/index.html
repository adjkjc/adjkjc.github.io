										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="text-align:justify;">
<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"><a href="https://silenceandbetrayal.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/zombiesahead.jpg" style="clear:left;float:left;margin-bottom:1em;margin-right:1em;"><img border="0" height="211" src="https://silenceandbetrayal.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/zombiesahead.jpg?w=320&#038;h=211" width="320" /></a></div>
<p>I put it out of my mind, as was the usual response during this time in my life. &nbsp;What I had heard practically meant nothing, and I walked out of the breakfast room with the sole intent of finding my girlfriend and righting the wrongs that were surrounding us. &nbsp;Our friend, Marge, met me there, and I told her we had to get out of there, she looked at me knowingly, and said she was ready to go also.</p></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">We walked through the front door together, and I had the feeling that we were both aware of something that most people on this earth would never glimpse. &nbsp;Having been <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1j7lyRnxVE">foiled</a> in my attempt to evade the gang stalkers, I decided to try a new tactic. &nbsp;This time, I would use an android application to order the cab, I picked the first one that came up on the travel application&#8217;s list, and told them we were staying at the Marriott. &nbsp;I even tried to use an obscure application, knowing that it was possible to intercept the packets traveling through my phone, and falsify the application&#8217;s function. &nbsp;While waiting the weirdness continued, and strangers waiting for a transport to the airport began discussing events from the prior week. &nbsp;They mentioned the hundred dollars I had give to a bum on the street, and said that I must have known they were watching. &nbsp;&#8220;He always knows too much.. &#8221; they said, and despite the fact that they were&nbsp;knowledgeable&nbsp;about an event that was witnessed by nobody, it did not phase me.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">We waited a long time, yet again, though I wasn&#8217;t familiar with the area, so I can&#8217;t comment as to the &#8216;normal&#8217; taxi wait. &nbsp;Our cab came, and we had decided to go see Mary. &nbsp;Both of us were tired, and Marge had rolled down her window and closed her eyes. &nbsp;Looking back on the events of two years ago, this probably should have alerted me to two things: 1) that Marge somehow knew what was coming, and 2) that I should be rolling my window down. &nbsp;Neither happened at the time, and I blame it on a mind altering haze.. source unknown.</div>
<blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align:justify;"><p>If you haven&#8217;t gotten it yet, the events of 2010 were filled with mystery and confusion. &nbsp;There were strange things happening to me, and I really had no idea the mechanism or source. &nbsp;I spent a considerable amount of time <i>after </i>they occurred researching possible ways these &#8220;tricks&#8221; could have been pulled off, but at the time I was left only with the suggestions the attackers intentionally left me: magic, psychic phenomenon, and aliens.</p></blockquote>
<div style="text-align:justify;">It happened again, this time I was so agitated in my head, I decided the next time it happened I would call the FBI, and not leave the cab until they arrived to inspect the air conditioning system. &nbsp;After hearing the now familiar sequence of chimes coming from the driver&#8217;s kiosk, I pulled my phone out to take pictures of the particles flying in the air. &nbsp;I took several pictures, and the cab driver muttered.. &#8220;this one is smart&#8221; under his breath. &nbsp; A few more tones, and the air intake reversed, pulling the particles from the air. &nbsp;I noticed that they had landed and stuck to the glass of my android phone, and wished that I had a plastic bag I could have kept it in. &nbsp;As before, the pictures would later be erased, however I was happy enough to have the situation diffused.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">I traded Marge for Mary at the friend&#8217;s house we were traveling to, which made Mary even more upset, as she was very wary and jealous of Marge hanging out with er ex&#8217;s.. apparently there was a history there beyond me. &nbsp;I had decided to put my fut down, confront Mary about what was going on, and fix our relationship.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">We went to Houston&#8217;s on the intracoastal, and sat down in the bar for drinks, since the outdoor seating was full. &nbsp;I firmly told her that the strange behavior had to stop, it was going to cost us our relationship, which had been on hold for many years since we had been previously married. &nbsp;I did not understand how she could be reconciling what she was doing with herself, but our relationship was true love, and I had the overwhelming feeling that it would prevail over whatever strange magic was being used against us. &nbsp;&#8220;Adam, this is a family thing,&#8221; she said to me. &nbsp;I wasn&#8217;t sure what exactly she meant, but it wasn&#8217;t the answer that I wanted. &nbsp;&#8220;We need to get through this, and without you being honest with me, there we have no hope.. I will not let this happen again.&#8221; &nbsp;In my eyes, she had repeatedly walked me into these treacherous situations, leading me to specific venues where the gang-stalking traps were set. &nbsp;It would have been impossible otherwise, for them to have known exactly where we were going, with enough foreknowledge to place so many civilian actors at the scenes&#8230; or so I thought.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;Do you still love me?&#8221; She replied yes quickly, and my heart swelled regardless of what had happened. &nbsp;This was good, and it meant that we truly would be conquering the evil surrounding us. &nbsp;Shortly a hostess came to seat us by the water, and we took a table next to a large family who appeared to have just sat down. &nbsp;For some reason I was drawn to their conversation, which appeared to be talking about some sort of organizational meeting, and after about twenty seconds, &#8220;it sounds just like an echo&#8221; one of the elder sons spoke to his mother, while looking directly at me.&nbsp;</div>
<blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align:justify;"><p>The implication was that they were listening to my thoughts, and I was repeating what they were saying in my head by eavesdropping. &nbsp;I&#8217;m not sure if the son was supposed to be psychic, or if he was listening on some sort of covert radio to what I would eventually call the &#8220;Mafia Operations Center.&#8221; &nbsp;Either way, looking back on this it was clear that I was aware of the deception, that they wanted me to believe they could hear what I was thinking, though it did not really register with me, and I was sure it was just that, a deception designed to make me sound crazy, if I dared repeat it.</p></blockquote>
<div style="text-align:justify;">The mother looked directly at my girlfriend, and mouthed the words &#8220;distract him, so we can talk.&#8221; &nbsp;<i>About me, great.</i>&nbsp; It appeared that this family was one of the &#8216;higher ups,&#8217; perhaps they were making a decision about stopping whatever was going on around us. &nbsp;Mary started talking about what we were going to order, and in my frustration of not knowing what would happen, I decided I would take charge of the situation and make plans to get us a place to stay later. &nbsp;I called one of my friends, and asked if they wanted to hang out around 4PM.. at least we would be with other people, nobody would be crazy enough to do this with witnesses around.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">We ate, and then decided to walk to the store to get some beach towels and bathing suits, it was a nice sunny day. &nbsp;The need or desire for relaxation at this time seems strange to me, but it is what we both wanted to do at the time. &nbsp;We walked towards a beach store on the corner, and decided to stop on a bus bench to take a rest. &nbsp;While there, Mary kissed my ear, and whispered &#8230; &#8220;want to find a place to do it?&#8221; &nbsp; Many years earlier, in our previous relationship, we had had a couple &#8220;voyeuristic&#8221; episodes, and I felt like we were traveling in time, rekindling something we had seemingly left in the past.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">We walked to a grass walk way between two buildings off the road, and I thought to myself that it probably wouldn&#8217;t be so comfortable for Mary&#8230; I put my bag down and sat down, and she smiled. &nbsp;It was still in plain view of the road, if anyone was looking directly at us, and I am pretty sure nothing would have happened regardless, but a few seconds later a passerby walked by the alley we were sitting in and asked if we &#8220;needed any change.&#8221;&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;No.&#8221; &nbsp;I was .. insulted. &nbsp;We had just eaten at a very expensive restaurant, and while I hadn&#8217;t showered or changed from the previous nights drama, I was sure I did not look like a bum. &nbsp;Ruining the mood once and for all, we walked to the store and browsed for a large beach towel. &nbsp;Sometime during our long visit, as Mary <i>never</i>&nbsp;shopped quickly, I decided we didn&#8217;t have time to lounge on the beach, and called a cab so we could visit my friend. &nbsp;We got in, with no trepidation even though practically every cab I had been in for the last 48 hours was somehow <b>compromised</b>&nbsp;my this dark force. &nbsp;I told him where we we going, out west on Atlantic, please, and he complied. &nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Just before we came to Dixie, I was <b>alerted</b>&nbsp;to look out the window. &nbsp;There was a pickup full of construction workers in the back, and also one of those road signs with light bulbs that can change the message. &nbsp;I looked for about 2 seconds, and then &#8230; as if I was in the Twlight Zone, the words flashed on the screen, even though it could not have been plugged in.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:center;"><b>RIGHT ON TIME</b></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="text-align:justify;">
<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"><a href="https://silenceandbetrayal.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/images.jpg" style="clear:right;float:right;margin-bottom:1em;margin-left:1em;"><br /></a></div>
<p><a href="https://silenceandbetrayal.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/tony-soprano-bw1.jpg" style="clear:left;float:left;margin-bottom:1em;margin-right:1em;"><img border="0" height="150" src="https://silenceandbetrayal.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/images.jpg?w=200&#038;h=150" width="200" /></a>I called Marge, my girlfriend&#8217;s best friend. &nbsp;We had hooked up once, many years prior, and in the recent weeks I had been doing something that I wasn&#8217;t very proud of. &nbsp;Intentionally hanging out with someone to make Mary jealous wasn&#8217;t my brightest idea, but I didn&#8217;t know what else to do since she had begun leaving me places whenever this <b>strangeness</b>&nbsp;would start happening &#8212; it&#8217;s almost like she was intentionally disappearing.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">In the interim, i went out on the unlocked terrace and smoked a cigarette. &nbsp;After sitting down on a cushioned iron chair, I heard a voice coming from the parking lot. &nbsp; The alert told me it was someone sitting in an unmarked van, &#8220;he&#8217;s going to feel really itchy.&#8221; &nbsp;I dismissed it, not knowing at the time that the feeling I was experiencing was intentionally induced with mind control. &nbsp;Finishing my cigarette, I went back inside and sat on the bed, waiting for my friend to arrive. &nbsp;Within a few minutes, I felt a really annoying itch all over my back. &nbsp;</div>
<blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align:justify;"><p>This strange itching phenomenon would occur again once in the immediate vicinity of this story, a few weeks later. &nbsp;I would later assume that the point of the itching powder, as I figured was the mechanism the &#8220;perps&#8221; were using to annoy me that day, was to induce me to take Benadryl to stop it. &nbsp;Through my research into brain function, I would find that anti-histamines assisted in the regeneration of neurotransmitter receptors, and discerned that whatever mechanism was being used in order to modify my thoughts and feelings was somehow related to receptor function. &nbsp;I was wrong, and it would be yet another elaborate deception used by this organization in order to mask the true mechanism and function of mind control.</p></blockquote>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Marge came over, in a taxi as she had been doing recently, and I paid for it. &nbsp;She came with a bottle of rum in her hand, and walked with me from Atlantic Ave to the front of the hotel. &nbsp;I looked at her, feeling a bit bad that I had invited her into this strange dark world, even though I was well aware that she knew more of what was going on than I did. &nbsp;&#8220;I think there&#8217;s camera&#8217;s all over the room&#8230;&#8221; I said, matter of factly. &nbsp;She looked at me, eyes rolling slightly in the back of her head, and said &#8220;oh, please, lets just go inside.&#8221; &nbsp;She neither confirmed nor denied, which was pretty much the status quo since the failed set up weeks prior. &nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">After we got in to the room, she said she was tired, and basically lied down and went to sleep. &nbsp;It wasn&#8217;t really the stimulating conversation I had been expecting, as we had been talking about the issues with the <b>extended family</b>, as I had begun calling their families organized crime connections. &nbsp;Trying to sleep on the other twin in the room, I laid awake staring at the ceiling for at least twenty minutes. &nbsp;Finally giving up, with no real reason in my mind as to my inability to sleep, I opened my laptop again, and this time began searching for information that could confirm the stories and description Mary had told me about the mafia.</div>
<blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align:justify;"><p>Prior to the attempted set up in November of 2010, Mary had&#8230; through very strange conversations, conveyed to me that she was a member of the &#8220;mafia,&#8221; &nbsp;She was non-specific about it, but told me that it was&#8217;t like it used to be, like the stories described in the Godfather and on The Sopranos. &nbsp;What she said was that the mafia was now much larger, and a loosely knit confederation of families, rather than the top down militaristic depiction with captains and enforcers. &nbsp;She had years earlier, when I had visited her grandparents house, mentioned that they had once been &#8220;associated&#8221; with a secret organization, so this wasn&#8217;t really totally new or outlandish, however it was given to me in an obviously contrived conversation for what was at the time&#8230; no apparent reason. &nbsp;Over the next few weeks, the strange and dark world of set up&#8217;s and trafficking would be.. shown to me in a similar fashion. &nbsp;This is what happened immediately prior to my current predicament. &nbsp;Obviously it was connected, and in my attempt to stop the shadows from doing whatever it was they were planning, I wanted to figure out how I could.. talk to them and ask them to stop. &nbsp;I guess I was looking for a &#8220;sit down,&#8221; though I had no idea who I was looking for.</p></blockquote>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><a href="https://silenceandbetrayal.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/ndrangheta1.jpg" style="clear:right;float:right;margin-bottom:1em;margin-left:1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="https://silenceandbetrayal.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/ndrangheta1.jpg?w=200&#038;h=200" width="200" /></a>I googled around on the internet, attempting to see if her story was a complete fabrication, or if there was some reality in it. &nbsp;She had told me so many strange things over the past weeks that it would not have surprised me if the entire thing was a delusion&#8230; though looking back on it, the contrived conversations were obviously intentional, and coming from somewhere other than Mary. &nbsp;I found a lot of very interesting information that day, and the description that she told me turned out to be an accurate description of the <b>&#8216;ndrangheta mafia. &nbsp;</b>Reading more about them, it appeared there were other groups associated.. the <b>Sacra Corona Unita</b>, and the <b>Camorra</b>. &nbsp;All three appeared to fit the &#8220;loose knit confederation of families&#8221; that had been described to me, however there was information from the CIA available that said the &#8216;ndrangheta was now the largest and most powerful cocaine trafficking organization in the world. &nbsp;This alone was reason enough for me to believe it fit the story, as the stories that had been told to me included very intelligence and high technology means of hiding that particular drug, inside <a href="http://www.google.com/patents/US20120231038">cellulose</a> <a href="http://www.google.com/patents/EP1940278A2?cl=en">fiber</a>, and using it as stuffing.</div>
<blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align:justify;"><p>Google searches being used to implant information in victims minds is something that happened to me very often during this time period, in addition it is something that I believe is used as standard operating procedure by this organization in order to introduce no ideas to victims. &nbsp;Both the search results, as well as what is searching for, can be controlled, and it gives the victim the impression that they &#8220;figured it all out themselves&#8221; which increases credibility in their minds. &nbsp;In addition to the searches related to criminal activity, this happens frequently when <a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2013/01/what-is-oseh-organized-stalking-and.html">researching the technology behind mind control</a>, often leading victims to unscientific articles, as well as the specific history that they are <b>supposed</b>&nbsp;to be finding &#8212; one that leads them directly to US intelligence as the creator of the technology.</p></blockquote>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Concluding my&#8230; &#8220;research&#8221; &nbsp;I started getting tired. &nbsp;Happy that I had made progress, and relieved that I was finally able to sleep, I closed my laptop lid and put it on the bed beside me.. I slept from 4 am to about 7 am. &nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Marge woke me up, and wanted to go have breakfast, but first, she said she had to change her clothes. <i>On camera?</i>&nbsp;I thought, fully believing that she was well aware of the surveillance system installed in the room. &nbsp;She took of her shirt, and in a very strange turn, told me she had felt a lump on her breast, and asked me if I would feel it. &nbsp;Being cognizant of the camera, and not wanting to give these criminals any evidence that I had done anything wrong with Marge &#8212; as I had suspected they were trying to break me up with my girlfriend, I declined. &nbsp;She grabbed my hands and placed them on her breasts, open palm, and then looked up directly at the smoke detector and smiled. &nbsp;I pulled away quickly, and said I was going to meet her at the breakfast area, pissed that she had done that. &nbsp;<i>Won&#8217;t make that mistake again</i>.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Once I entered the breakfast area, I noticed it was <b>full</b>&nbsp;of people, I tended to avoid crowded restaurants, and decided I wasn&#8217;t going to stay at the hotel for the second night I had booked. &nbsp;While waiting for my &#8220;companion&#8221; to meet me there, something very strange happened. &nbsp;The people surrounding me began.. whispering, except it was a very loud whisper. &nbsp;I heard them repeat several times &#8220;<b>he knows who we are&#8230;&#8221;</b>&nbsp;and immediately recollected my internet searches from the prior night, which I had not thought about since waking. &nbsp;I left quickly, walking to the front of the hotel, and as I left I heard one more comment: &#8220;I didn&#8217;t know he was such a good projector.&#8221;</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"><a href="https://silenceandbetrayal.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/images.jpg" style="margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em;text-align:center;"><img border="0" src="https://silenceandbetrayal.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/images.jpg?w=450" /></a></div>

<div style="text-align:justify;"><i><a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2013/01/taxi-cab-confession.html">Still playing ball</a>? </i>I repeated it in my head, as I walked briskly out the door, intent on not being stuck in the same situation I had been, surrounded by people playing this nefarious game. &nbsp;<i>What&#8217;s the point, all these people.. </i>I hadn&#8217;t tried to visit the FBI again, but I was sure her &#8216;game&#8217; was about not complaining to the authorities. &nbsp;I walked outside, around the corner, and across the street&#8230; Noticing a small boutique hotel around the corner, I increased my pace &nbsp;and asked how much a night would be. &nbsp;&#8220;No rooms available tonight,&#8221; &nbsp;<i>Of course not.</i>&nbsp; Feeling railroaded.. I thought that maybe if I did &#8216;play ball,&#8217; I could end this hellish &nbsp;experience, feeling bold and armed with the new idea of attacking them on their own turf, I walked back in to the Marriott on Atlantic Ave.</div>
</div>
<blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align:justify;"><p>This was <b>street theater</b>, but I didn&#8217;t know it yet. &nbsp;Strangers having staged conversations around you, with the sole intent of you hearing. &nbsp;Their conversations often included personal details from your life that they should have no knowledge of, or communicated a message to you. &nbsp;Alerting you to their constant presence, it serves to create the illusion of paranoia, one of the prime reasons for the attack. &nbsp;The attack works, and it&#8217;s been used for decades against honest victims, like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Jesus_Angleton">James Jesus Angleton</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://warofmoles.blogspot.com/2011/09/james-jesus-angleton-reconsidered.html">too close</a> to <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol53no4/201ccunning-passages-contrived-corridors201d.html">the truth</a>. <span style="font-size:xx-small;">(tm)</span></p></blockquote>
<div style="text-align:justify;">I walked back in through the restaurant on the left side of the building, it was under construction. &nbsp;Unsure of whether or not I was doing the right thing, I slowly walked towards the front desk, I had received intimidating threats.. suggestions that I might be thrown from a balcony, as I re-affirmed my decision to stay at that hotel, I decided I would only stay on the first floor, just to be safe. &nbsp;&#8220;Any rooms available?&#8221; &nbsp;I asked, knowing full well the answer would be yes. &nbsp;&#8220;We have one ground floor room by the spa,&#8221; the clerk replied, without me even asking. &nbsp;&#8220;Perfect.&#8221;</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">I paid for two nights, thinking my girlfriend would join me, especially if I enticed her with the spa on the&nbsp;premises, and took the electronic key card and started walking towards the room. &nbsp;The blonde couple had been in the shadows behind me the entire time, and as I walked away, the woman made another comment, &#8220;did you even have to pay?&#8221;</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">I found the room, slipped the electronic key in to the door, and as I was walking in I overheard a voice, &#8220;he&#8217;s not going to be happy when he see&#8217;s the door.&#8221; &nbsp;I walked in and immediately surveyed the room, the first thing I notice is the glass sliding door, facing the parking lot is slightly ajar, and has no lock on it. &nbsp;<i>Wonderful&#8230; </i>Turning around and placing my book bag on the bed, I notice that the smoke detector is hanging off the wall it had been mounted on, pointed towards the room. &nbsp;<i>Found one camera.</i>&nbsp; I immediately stood up on the bed, thought about ripping it down and taking it for evidence.. <i>ball game</i>.. I placed the smoke detector back on its mount, and rotated it, locking it in place.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Afterwords, I decided to browse back to <a href="http://myfreecams.com/">myfreecams.com</a> to see if the <b>weirdness </b>was still there. &nbsp;Instantly after joining a room: &#8220;wow, where are you now?&#8221; &nbsp;I&#8217;ve got to be honest, I&#8217;m a little excited now, I&#8217;d pretty much decided this was an elaborate joke, and the whole thing was starting to be a little bit more.. fun. &nbsp;At least that&#8217;s how I felt right at that moment. &nbsp;Getting back to business, you know, trying to stop these very skilled hackers from being able to monitor my whereabouts using my cellular phone, I decided to upgrade to <a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.org/">cyanogenmod</a>, leaving MFC in the background. &nbsp;I&#8217;ve done this many, many times, so in about 2 minutes I have the ROM downloaded, and I&#8217;m flashing.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">From nowhere, I hear a voice.. &#8220;what&#8217;s wrong with this thing.. I can&#8217;t see him anymore.. anybody else having a problem with the phone?&#8221; &nbsp;<i>My phone camera.</i>&nbsp; Honestly, hadn&#8217;t even thought of it, but given the last surveillance device I had dealt with, it made <b>a lot</b>&nbsp;of sense. &nbsp;I also apparently just found out that there are multiple camera&#8217;s on this strange system.</div>
<blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align:justify;"><p>Note to victims reading: &nbsp;Just like <b>street theater</b>, the camera story is designed to induce the appearance of insanity. &nbsp;The camera&#8217;s aren&#8217;t really there, not in your phone, not in your TV, and there aren&#8217;t people watching you all over the world, I promise. (It&#8217;s <a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2012/11/the-carnivore-conspiracy.html">just the NSA</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2012/12/occams-razor.html">friends</a>) &nbsp;The psychological abuse however, <i>is real</i>, and there are real people trying very hard to make you think you are being watched. &nbsp;They&#8217;re probably doing a pretty good job, too.</p></blockquote>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Feeling reassured that I had shut down all of the illicit surveillance, I called my girlfriend, who did not answer the phone, <b>again.</b>&nbsp; Time for some desperate measures, I phoned her best friend.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="text-align:justify;">At this point I am practically jogging, attempting to get away from whatever it was that was so important that the video I had taken was deleted. &nbsp;I felt as if there was no escape from this.. in my parents home, their neighborhood, the same thing was happening that had happened at my apartment earlier. &nbsp;I just wanted to get away, and was glad that I had rented a hotel <b>far away.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align:justify;"><p>I had a very strange experience in a taxi a few weeks prior, so I was attempting to avoid getting one that was <b>on the payroll,</b>&nbsp;as I called the people who were somehow associated with the large group of people acting strangely around me for the last few months. &nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">I&nbsp;walked in to a restaurant, sat down and had a cup of coffee, and requested that the waitress call a cab for me, thinking that this would avoid whatever listening device had been placed in the software of my cell phone. &nbsp;The cab came about thirty minutes later, a long wait in the area I was in, and I jumped in and asked him to take me to the Extended Stay America in Palm Beach.</div>
<div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">The cab driver was Jamaican, asked me how I was doing in, and put on some music. &nbsp;Everything seemed normal, apparently my evasive maneuvers had worked. &nbsp;Feeling relieved, I called my girlfriend again to see if she wanted me to stop by and pick her up on the way to the hotel. &nbsp;This time she answered the phone, and during the conversation, I overheard a train in the background. &nbsp;The only person I knew of that she knew who lived near train tracks was her ex, and cringed inside. &nbsp;She told me she might come to the hotel in a few hours, and barely made small talk before telling me her cell phone battery was low and she&#8217;d have to call me back. &nbsp;<i>Great</i>.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">A bit more agitated now, I rolled own my window in the rear of the cab, and asked the driver if he minded if I smoked a cigarette&#8230; he said no. &nbsp;I slouched a bit in the chair, thinking about the <a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2013/01/now-you-know.html">strange events</a> of the <a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2013/01/the-morning-star.html">previous night</a>. &nbsp;<i>It&#8217;s just not true. &nbsp;</i>I thought about who would have access to the exploits that would be required to access a webcam on a machine not connected to a network, the kind of people I had read about in <a href="http://manybooks.net/titles/dakanrother07Geek_Mafia.html">Geek Mafia</a>, by Rick Dakkan&#8230; or maybe an intelligence agency &#8212; certainly nothing I had ever read of law enforcement (state of federal) being able to accomplish. &nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">We were exiting I-95, heading towards Congress where the hotel was. &nbsp;Suddenly, the driver rolled up my window, and said he was going to put on the air conditioning. &nbsp;I didn&#8217;t object, and looked out the window for the hotel, which was supposed to be right off the highway. &nbsp;Neither of us saw it, and we circled around one more time before I asked him to drive east towards the beach, thinking that might entice my girlfriend to join me later. &nbsp;Driving east, the driver began pressing buttons somewhere out of view, I could tell because of the strange chimes that each button press echoed in my ear. &nbsp;I was alerted to his center console, and noticed that the normal GUI interface had been replaced with a high contrast text interface. &nbsp;I could not read it.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Seconds later, the air went full bast, it was a&nbsp;noticeable&nbsp;change in sound, and I looked around the cab. &nbsp;Tiny white particles were flying around in the air, and stuck when the hit front of my eye glasses. &nbsp;I whirled inside, thoughts of the set up my girlfriend had warned me about focused clearly in my mind&#8217;s eye. &nbsp;&#8220;<i>They&#8221; are drugging me..</i>&nbsp;it was almost exactly like the last time this happened, and I immediately told the driver to stop at the first hotel he could find. &nbsp;I was so anxious that I did not even know where I was. &nbsp;I attempted to roll down the window, to get fresh air, and it had been locked. &nbsp;&#8220;Please roll my window down.. &#8221; I grunted at the driver. &nbsp;He complied, just as he was pulling in to the parking lot of a Marriot hotel right on the beach. &nbsp;I jumped out of the car immediately, grabbing my backpack and walked around to the driver side. &nbsp;I didn&#8217;t feel any different, <i>what on Earth could these people be thinking, so brazen. &nbsp;</i>I paid the driver a large tip, almost twenty dollars, relieved that he had both rolled the window down and stopped quickly. <i>&nbsp;Maybe disaster had been averted</i>, since I had noticed what was going on.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">I walked in to the hotel to book a room, and as I walked towards the front desk, a blonde man standing with his wife and speaking to the clerk said, &#8220;Here he is now.&#8221; &nbsp;He looked directly at me.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Enraged, I immediately turned around, <i>the cab driver must have brought me here on purpose</i>, my heart sank, and I began walking towards the door. &nbsp;A mind control alert followed, and I heard his companion say &#8220;he&#8217;s still playing ball, right?&#8221;</div>
</div>
</div>

					<description><![CDATA[I feel like I need to stop the story for a moment, and explain what&#8217;s going on. &#160;I have had <a class="more" href="https://silenceandbetrayal.wordpress.com/2013/01/08/the-wonder-years-princess-bride-and-reality/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="text-align:justify;"><a href="https://silenceandbetrayal.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/princessbridegrandfather.jpg" style="clear:right;float:right;margin-bottom:1em;margin-left:1em;text-align:center;"><img border="0" height="196" src="https://silenceandbetrayal.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/princessbridegrandfather.jpg?w=320&#038;h=196" width="320" /></a></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">I feel like I need to stop the story for a moment, and explain what&#8217;s going on. &nbsp;I have had several victims contact me asking questions, who seem to be going through a very similar situation right now. This tells me two things; first, what happened to me is more common place than I had previously thought. &nbsp;Second, I can&#8217;t make the story as fun as I thought it would become. &nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">My goal with telling the story the way I have been was to show you how my thought process changed throughout this ordeal. &nbsp;I wanted to make it very clear that <b>mind control</b>&nbsp;was responsible for distorting the truth, making me unaware of what was going on around me, and believe fanciful things. &nbsp;My intention was to make this surprising and suspenseful, not really making it obvious that my world-view was changing (even though I did tell you about <b>reality shifting</b>). &nbsp;The point, was to vicariously explain how you can be aware that your perceptions are being altered, while still being unaware that your changing realizations &#8212; how you perceive what is happening &#8212; is actually being directed by someone or something else. &nbsp;More clearly, my understanding of what was going on, which was my primary drive in &#8216;playing the game&#8217; of discovering how <i><b>mind control</b>&nbsp;worked</i>&nbsp;was, and still is, the mechanism through which my opponent was controlling me. &nbsp;Please be aware that most of this writing is told as if I were current experiencing what I am writing about, and I have tried to remain as true to my inner mindset as possible. &nbsp;Almost all of how I felt at the time is no longer valid. &nbsp;As I start finishing up the &#8220;Truman Show&#8221; portion, and move <i>back in time</i> towards the darker drug cartel and organized crime portion, you will begin to see not only the point of the Truman Show, but also how much I didn&#8217;t understand for so long.</div>
<blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align:justify;"><p>In certain instances, I have indented text, this is meant to be closer to my &#8220;current take&#8221; on what is going on. &nbsp;You might consider it similar to Fred Savage&#8217;s voice-over in <i style="font-weight:bold;">The Wonder Years, </i>or his grandfather&#8217;s voice in <i style="font-weight:bold;">The Princess Bride.</i>&nbsp; Just a little note on synchronicity and lack of coincidence here: &nbsp;it&#8217;s pretty funny that both of my examples point back to the same actor.</p></blockquote>
<div style="text-align:justify;">For those that are experiencing symptoms of what I am describing, you are in a much more dangerous situation than the current posts describe, please do not think I am taking what is happening to you lightly. &nbsp;I have written a letter to victims of &#8220;Mindwar,&#8221; as I call it, and hope you will read that. &nbsp; Beware, the people that are actively working to damage your credibility as a Federal witness, intimidate you into <i>not</i>&nbsp;testifying, and psychologically abuse you are <i style="font-weight:bold;">dangerous criminals.</i>&nbsp; Also please be aware that not everyone you <i>think</i>&nbsp;is &#8220;in on it&#8221; is.. one of the most difficult mechanisms of this attack to get through is the feeling that the entire world is out to get you. &nbsp;It&#8217;s definitely not. &nbsp;There are still good and loving people around you. &nbsp;Your family loves you. &nbsp;The world has not plunged into the depths of Hades yet, though it might be on the precipice.</div>

					<description><![CDATA[After smoking I went back upstairs, and stared at the ceiling until I thought it was late enough to call <a class="more" href="https://silenceandbetrayal.wordpress.com/2013/01/08/satan-in-my-phone/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="text-align:justify;">After smoking I went back upstairs, and stared at the ceiling until I thought it was late enough to call my girlfriend. &nbsp;Being unable to sleep the entire night was not a normal thing for me, in fact before tonight it had never happened like this &#8212; without a wink. &nbsp;I wanted to tell her what had happened the night before, ask her what she thought of it, see if maybe it was something she part of a conversation between my parents, who had just woken, &#8220;do you think he will sign the waiver?&#8221; my mother asked. &nbsp;</div>
<blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align:justify;"><p>Much, much later, after investigating the technology involved, I would become aware that the force responsible for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Corley_Conspiracy">mind controlled opera</a> I was unwittingly thrust in to the center of was able to falsify conversations, to force you to overhear things that were not really there. &nbsp;This is done via stimulation of the auditory cortex, and when you fully understand that the effects you are noticing can only be accomplished by stimulating action potentials, it should be obvious that this capability is also within the realm of reason. &nbsp;Because of <b>reality shifting</b>&nbsp;though, it&#8217;s not obvious, in fact, you can be kept completely oblivious to further possibilities and uses of the technology.</p></blockquote>
<div style="text-align:justify;">I began whirling inside.. <i>did they know about it too?</i>&nbsp; I was still convinced it was a prank, but at this point that others around me had been deceived into thinking it was some sort of Fear Factor like television show. &nbsp; I began getting angry, and also nervous about the possibility of more camera&#8217;s being hidden in this house, just like the other one. &nbsp;<i>Maybe my girlfriend was right, maybe it was the CIA.&nbsp;</i></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><i><br /></i></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">I walked out of the house to call her, as I often do. &nbsp;It&#8217;s a habit I guess, but I enjoy talking on my cell phone as I&#8217;m walking. &nbsp;She didn&#8217;t answer, and I was really not thrilled with being in the area. &nbsp;I was also worried that the same thing might be happening to her.. the thought of escaping the area entered my mind, and I decided to get rent a room at the Extended Stay America in Palm Beach, thinking I might be outside the grip of whatever nefarious group was tricking everyone around me. &nbsp;After doing this, I decided to walk to a near by shopping center, in order to call a cab there. &nbsp;</div>
<blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align:justify;"><p>This might seem a bit strange, but both of us had had some very odd experiences in cabs to date, one refused to open the door &nbsp;for us, and would not take us where we wanted to go, demanding that we stop at a specific shopping center. &nbsp;Another had made some under-the-breath remarks, and had a strange interface on his fare meter. &nbsp;I was a computer person, and I always take notice of POS interfaces, this one was not graphical, but a text interface that had inverted colors. &nbsp;He was pressing buttons on another terminal, one that was outside of my view, and it made loud chimes&#8230; it was very attention grabbing, and in hindsight it was an obvious <b>alert. &nbsp;</b>This interface would later today, and throughout the ordeal, play a large role in several sub-threads of the psychological attack.</p></blockquote>
<div style="text-align:justify;">I began walking briskly, upset that I had not been able to get her on the phone. &nbsp;I wanted to get there so I could tell her I had a safer place for us to stay. &nbsp;Walking on the street instead of the sidewalk, I saw two older women walking towards me, on the other side of the street. &nbsp;They were on the side walk, and one of them seemed to be arguing with the other, her arms flailing in her oratory. &nbsp;I could not hear what was being said until they got a little closer, when the alert came: &nbsp;&#8220;Just let him go.&#8221; &nbsp;This time the alert was accompanied by something else, a transmitted impression of the situation &#8212; the knowledge that they were talking about me. &nbsp;It wasn&#8217;t accompanied by anxiety or classical paranoia, just the tacit knowing that whatever it was they were talking about, it was revolving an argument about me leaving the house. &nbsp;I slowed down a little, glanced at them and then glanced away, and continued on. &nbsp;We passed each other, and I was about a block to their south when something else happened.</div>
<blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align:justify;"><p>A few weeks earlier, my girlfriend and I had experienced something strange. &nbsp;We were standing outside our apartment, deciding whether or not we were going to leave to visit a friend. &nbsp;She wanted to go really badly, and because of what had been happening during the prior weeks, I had become weary of her plans when they changed abruptly and without reason. &nbsp;During our conversation, something began hitting us from what appeared to be the roofs of the apartments around us. &nbsp;It left lacerations on our skin, with a white residue, and for the next hour or two it seemed as if we had both been drugged. &nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<div style="text-align:justify;">As I was walking past the two women, something hit the bottom of my pants. &nbsp;I was instantly filled with feeling that this was the same weapon that had been used on the two of us weeks earlier. &nbsp;I swirled around, pulling my phone from my pocket as I had the previous time. &nbsp;From one of the houses I was walking past, I heard one thing &#8220;uh-oh.&#8221;</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://redpepper.gr/uploads/satan%20inside.png" style="clear:left;float:left;margin-bottom:1em;margin-right:1em;"><img border="0" src="https://i2.wp.com/redpepper.gr/uploads/satan%20inside.png" /></a>Feverishly, I started navigating the Android interface to the camcorder application. &nbsp;I started recording, and circled the area with my phone, hoping to catch a glimpse of who or what was doing this to me. &nbsp;After about 20 seconds of recording, standing in the middle of a suburban street at the early hours of the morning, I stopped the recording. &nbsp;Attempting to email it to myself, in order to save it &#8220;on the record&#8221; in Google&#8217;s cloud, the icons on the screen began shaking, an effect which was not normal for Android. &nbsp;Afterwords, the phone did a Looney-Tunes like transition to black, another effect which was not normal for the software on the phone. &nbsp;I quickly turned the screen back on and navigated to the gallery, the video I had just taken was gone.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><i><br /></i></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<div style="text-align:justify;"><i>Clever people.</i>&nbsp; At this point I knew they must have put a virus on my phone, one that enabled themdelete the video. &nbsp;The overtness of the special effects struck a chord in me though, certainly they did not need special effects in order to delete a movie, they could have easily just removed it from the flash memory with no notice. &nbsp;<i>Why would they alert me to their&nbsp;presence&nbsp;in my phone with visual cues?</i></div>
<div style="text-align:center;"><i><br /></i></div>

					<description><![CDATA[She was nowhere to be found, but what she had told me stuck in my head. &#160;What kind of TV <a class="more" href="https://silenceandbetrayal.wordpress.com/2013/01/08/the-morning-star/">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&#8594;</span></a>]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="text-align:justify;">She was nowhere to be found, but what she had told me stuck in my head. &nbsp;<i>What kind of TV show could I be on? &nbsp;</i>Maybe it explained all the strange behavior me and my girlfriend had been noticing for the past month&#8230; her strange behavior. &nbsp;<i>Maybe she knows.</i>&nbsp; I wondered how they could get away with it.. a reality show where the participants were unaware it was going on.. <i>I have to find out more.</i></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><i><br /></i></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Quickly I joined another room, and spoke aloud, &#8220;can you hear me?&#8221; &nbsp;No reply came, and I felt a combination of relief and disappointment. &nbsp;Not sure what to do next, I sat and watched for a few minutes, before decided to get a little bolder and try to send a coded message to the model. &nbsp;I tipped 7 tokens, with a message attached &#8220;anything you want to tell me?&#8221; &nbsp;The girl had been talking on the screen, but I hadn&#8217;t really heard the words, then they began focusing in my head, I heard her say &#8220;he think&#8217;s that&#8217;s the number of God&#8230;. he&#8217;s not right.&#8221; &nbsp;</div>
<blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align:justify;"><p>It&#8217;s important to note here that while it was being clearly communicated to me, and shown via responses and actions, that these people were responding to my thoughts and beliefs &#8230; things which there is no possible way they could have any knowledge of, that I just didn&#8217;t get it. &nbsp;I guess I recognized that fact, but it didn&#8217;t flow through to my other thoughts, like the cognitive process was disconnected. &nbsp;Most of the time, when you learn a new fact, or think about a new possibility, it causes past ideas and views to be re-evaluated, changed, or at least &#8220;recollected.&#8221; &nbsp;That didn&#8217;t happen here, its almost like I was subconsciously ignoring the entire thing. In short, it was knowing something without understanding it.</p></blockquote>
<div style="text-align:justify;">I glanced over to my buddy list on the right hand side of the window, clicked on another name, and joined that room. &nbsp;This time the girl was in the middle of talking on camera, apparently in the middle of telling a story.. as soon as I entered she paused, &#8220;who is here?&#8221; as if she was hearing something broadcast over an intercom. &nbsp;Now the entire room is hearing only her half of a conversation: &#8220;someone insignificant?&#8221; &nbsp;My heart sank a little, remembering the UFO encounter, cementing my belief that it was falsified. &nbsp;Instantly, &#8220;wait no.. sorry.. someone important?&#8221; &nbsp;She continued telling the story she was in the middle of when I entered, talking about how she had just returned to the site after a long hiatus, and discussing her recent move. &nbsp;I was half listening to her, half watching the television show.. it was talking about the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazca_Lines">Nasca Lines</a>, and again was <b>alerted</b>&nbsp;back to the screen on my laptop.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">&#8220;It&#8217;s like right over here&#8230; &#8221; and she jumped up and gestured towards the center of the wall to her immediate left. &nbsp;I looked around my room. &nbsp;Almost instantly I finally understood. &nbsp;To my left was my old Apple iMac, humming on standby, it&#8217;s screen dark black. &nbsp;It was plugged in to the power outlet, but was not connected to my wireless internet. &nbsp;<i>These guys must be pretty good.</i>&nbsp; I had figured it out, they must have hacked into that machine, probably using its bluetooth or wifi interface card from a car passing by.. they were able to see me through the integrated webcam, even though its bright green light was not illuminated. &nbsp;I instantly jumped up and pulled the stark white cord from its place in the back of the shiny iMac. &nbsp;Relieved that it was just a silly prank, I sat back down to see what happened. &nbsp;&#8220;Now there is only one more,&#8221; she said almost instantly, pointing now towards the rear corner on the other side of the room she was in. &nbsp;<i>No more iMac&#8217;s in here. &nbsp;</i>I looked towards that corner in my room, there was a fake rose bush there, on a&nbsp;pedestal&nbsp;behind my television&#8230; <i>maybe it&#8217;s in the television.</i>&nbsp; Almost instantly: &#8220;It must be in a flower.&#8221; Completely taken a back, I laid down on the bed, rested my head on the pillow, and closed my eyes. &nbsp;&#8220;He must be out,&#8221; came the reply.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">I smiled inside. &nbsp;<i>I guess they don&#8217;t know everything.</i>&nbsp; By this time the interaction between the people on the screen and what I was doing had stopped phasing me at all, it was expected. &nbsp;I was a bit curious as to why she had thought I had passed out, and also relieved that she was wrong. &nbsp;I figured I&#8217;d ham it up a bit, and pretend to sleep for a little while longer. &nbsp;I peaked out of the corner of my eye to see what was going on, as the sound coming from the computer had stopped completely.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">My focus shifted as I noticed the girl on the computer screen had lifted her laptop, and was walking through her apartment. &nbsp; She walked into a room full of boxes, and said out loud &#8220;if I am not careful, I might wind up in a box on the side of the road.&#8221; &nbsp;She jumped into the pile of boxes, landing with her arms and legs outside the box, looked into her camera, and then got up and walked back to the other room. Thinking back on it, it seems like it may have been a threat directed at me, but at the time my conscious thought was that she was trying to convey a message: that she had been threatened for telling me where the camera had been. &nbsp;Looking back, I think the box scene must have been recorded in advance, or at least planned, either way it stands out. </p>
<p>More time had passed than I had thought, and it was now almost six a.m. &nbsp;I closed the laptop and tried to sleep, but was unable to for the remainder of the night. &nbsp;I walked back outside to smoke a cigarette about an hour later, and saw Venus, shining brightly in the northern sky, <i>the morning star</i>. &nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">There was only one thought in my mind.. <i>call my girlfriend.</i></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="text-align:justify;">This is the first in a series, for the Table of Contents: &nbsp;<a href="http://unduecoercion.org/p/silence-betrayal_10.html">Silence &amp; Betrayal</a></p>
<p>After a much more dark and trying experience in November and early December of 2010, I received what I now consider a gift from the Illuminati. &nbsp;I was privileged enough to receive the lead role in my very own custom tailored science fiction adventure.. although at the time I didn&#8217;t know it was fiction. &nbsp;My life had been turned upside down, I was unable to work at my normal and simple job doing IT work for.. myself, and <i>it sure seemed like the <a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2013/01/silence-satan.html">shadows were enveloping me</a>. &nbsp;</i></div>
<blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align:justify;"><p>Before I continue, I have to introduce you to two more <i>mind control </i>&#8220;symptoms.&#8221; &nbsp;First, the <b style="font-style:italic;">alert. &nbsp;</b>This is when your sight or hearing is focused on something specific, mostly unknown to you, to ensure that you will witness it, it&#8217;s kind of like a spotlight being put on something going on around you, and it&#8217;s very prevalent in street theater, though most people don&#8217;t recognize that its happening. &nbsp;It&#8217;s basically forcing you to turn your head and look at a specific &#8220;actor&#8221; (without you knowing), and ensuring that you hear what they are saying, regardless of how far away from them you are. &nbsp;It is also used to reinforce memory retention, and I have a significant number of memories from this time that normally would probably have fallen into the abyss. &nbsp;The second is what I call <b>reality shifting</b>, and it amounts to a &#8220;subtle&#8221; change in your outlook, and it is pretty much the subject of he following story.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align:justify;"><p>For the remainder of this story, and all subsequent posts in this series, my inner <b>dialogue</b>&nbsp;will be <i>italicized. &nbsp;</i>I say dialogue in lieu of monologue for a reason, and it is one that I would not fully understand for months after these events occurred, suffice it to say, when you are a victim of OSEH, it becomes clear that your thoughts are not always your own.</p></blockquote>
<div style="text-align:center;">
<div style="text-align:center;"><b>ENTER STAGE LEFT: </b>Truman Show Syndrome</div>
</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">
<div style="text-align:center;"></div>
</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">My girlfriend and I had separated, neither of us wanting to stay in our former apartment, not the least of which because of the strange noises we had been hearing there.. knocks on the walls, people scurrying back and forth at all hours of the night, strange chimes&#8230; but more so because we both had suspected that during our last visit to her families, someone had secretly installed video surveillance equipment hidden inside our electronic equipment. &nbsp;Things had been very strange since our trip to Orlando for Thanksgiving, and while we had tried to stay together in hotels back in Lauderdale, I felt it was better we separate in case the people that were following us were only trying to get to me. &nbsp;She stayed with a friend for a few nights, and I had decided to save money by staying with my parents&#8230; it also felt much safer there, as it was impossible for the army of perfect strangers to harass me when I was safely inside a private residence&#8230; or so I thought.</p>
<p>I was getting ready for bed, turned the television and the lights off, opened my laptop and laid down on the bed. &nbsp;I had frequented a site called <a href="http://myfreecams.com/">myfreecams.com</a>&nbsp;for a few years prior to this, and went there out of sheer boredom. &nbsp;This was a pornographic webcam site, and after today it would become central to this sub-story. &nbsp;Slowly clicking through my favorite list of about 20 people, I found someone that I had enjoyed talking to. &nbsp;We were about the same age, and had talked in the past, mostly about trivial things, but sometimes about past jobs and relationships. &nbsp;I said hello, and she took a very long time to reply, much longer than usual. &nbsp;Watching her on the camera, it appeared that she was reading a long message on her computer screen, and given the amount of time it was taking it could not have been from me. &nbsp;I watched her eyes move back and forth, slowly getting wider as she neared the conclusion of the message. &nbsp;I was almost ready to leave, a little pissed at being ignored by someone that I had spoken to frequently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Adam, there&#8217;s something I have to tell you,&#8221; she said verbally, which was very non-normal for her, as we normally communicated in instant messages, since there were at least two hundred other people in the room. &nbsp;This startled me, as I had never heard her say my name out loud before, and I looked around to make sure there was nobody else in the vicinity of my room. &nbsp;After confirming this, I spoke aloud &#8220;oh, God, what now?&#8221; for no apparent reason, as I was usually silent. &nbsp;&#8220;You are on TV.&#8221;</p>
<p><i>She really needs to stop smoking that stuff. </i>Immediately after finishing the thought, her camera disconnected and she signed offline, this happened sometimes, as the website was somewhat amateurish in its programming, looking about a generation of HTML code behind the top of the line websites. &nbsp;<i>This is all I need, another crazy person telling me strange stories.</i>&nbsp; My thoughts trailed off, and I remembered the long message she was reading prior to talking to me, it dawned on me that perhaps the people that had been following us around had somehow figured out what websites I went to, and that they were trying to freak me out here, where I thought I was safe. &nbsp;I went outside to smoke a cigarette, and the single strangest thing that ever happened to me occurred.</p>
<p>I received what I now know is an <b>alert</b>, and while smoking looked up at the night sky, and noticed what I believed to be Venus growing&nbsp;intensely&nbsp;brighter. &nbsp;I stared at it for at least 20 seconds and then realized that it appeared to be coming closer to me, and moving slightly, as if it was making an approach. &nbsp;<i>An airplane.</i>&nbsp; And then it happened. &nbsp;The &#8220;airplane&#8221; began moving much faster, and changing its orientation at very steep angles, sometimes 45 degrees, sometimes as much as 180. &nbsp;It would have crushed the pilot with g-force at the speeds I was witnessing, and I was filled with awe&#8230; I was, for the first time in my life, witnessing an actual <b>Unidentified Flying Object. &nbsp;</b>This continued for at least another 45 seconds, as I looked up without moving, my jaw gaping wide in disbelief. &nbsp;My inner dialogue continued, as the strange events of the last month had taken an even eerier turn, and somehow were beginning to make more sense. &nbsp;<i>What do you want with me? &nbsp;Please, land and talk to me, I&#8217;ve waited my entire life for this.</i><br /><i><br /></i>It vanished almost as quickly as it had begun descending, and Venus was back in its rightful place in the Northern sky. &nbsp;I dismissed the entire event, for what appears to be no reason at all, in what I now describe as a mind controlled cascade of <b>reality shifting</b><i style="font-weight:bold;">, </i>almost as if the thoughts I had been having were invalidated, slowly and noticeably compared to their onset .. <i>just an airplane </i>.. even though what I had witnessed was most certainly not. &nbsp;I finished my cigarette and went back to my room.</p>
<p><a href="http://files.abovetopsecret.com/images/member/ee06c8e95184.jpg" style="clear:right;float:right;margin-bottom:1em;margin-left:1em;text-align:center;"><img border="0" height="213" src="https://i0.wp.com/files.abovetopsecret.com/images/member/ee06c8e95184.jpg" width="320" /></a>Entering my room, I saw the bed was still illuminated with the glow of the laptop screen, and somehow&nbsp;my television had turned on. &nbsp;I didn&#8217;t really take much note of it, and laid back down on the bed to see if my friend had signed back on. &nbsp;Once laying down I was again <b>alerted</b>&nbsp;to the television, and saw that the show <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CDEQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.history.com%2Fshows%2Fancient-aliens&amp;ei=WMXqUKjMNqm10AGJuYH4CA&amp;usg=AFQjCNG7TaEc8GqE7jlLY53Gjl79MGM9tg&amp;bvm=bv.1355534169,d.eWU">Ancient Aliens</a> was on. &nbsp;This is a television series that seems to be based on the ideas of<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chariots_of_the_Gods%3F"> Chariots of the Gods</a> by Erik Von Danniken, it&#8217;s about aliens influencing human society and religion since pre-history. &nbsp;I had never seen the television show before, and rarely watched the History channel, so the fact that it was on my television screen was probably much odder than I noticed at the time. &nbsp;My sixth grade history teacher, however, had recommended Chariots of the Gods to us, and I had always found it fascinating, wondering how such an obvious theory was not more mainstream throughout my youth.</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"><a href="http://files.abovetopsecret.com/images/member/ee06c8e95184.jpg" style="clear:right;float:right;margin-bottom:1em;margin-left:1em;"><br /></a></div>
<p>The <b>alert</b>&nbsp;moved to the bottom of the screen, and I read the tag line for the show. &nbsp;<i>Now you know.</i></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><i>Organized Stalking and Electronic Harassment</i><br /><i><br /></i>  </p>
<div style="text-align:justify;">OSEH is a psychological attack that is being performed on innocent people all around the world. &nbsp;There are a significant number of victims, and there are many common links in what they are describing. &nbsp;It is clear to me, as a victim that has experienced what I believe to be a very broad spectrum of the techniques used, that this attack is being performed by a centralized authority, one whose primary goal is to <i>make public the use of mind control technology.</i>&nbsp; This opinion is made in hindsight after quite a bit of analysis, and the actual psychological attack attempts relentlessly to create confusion and delusion as to both the &#8220;how,&#8221; &#8220;who,&#8221; and &#8220;why&#8221; of something that is so off-putting that it almost unanimously causes its victims to not only cry out at the top of their lungs, but seek out grounding in reality.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">When it first began happening to me, in November and December of 2010, I called it &#8220;reality shifting,&#8221; and I imagine it will be very hard to describe just how powerful it is, but I am going to try. &nbsp;OSEH is designed to use fear and intimidation in order to cause the victim to tell a story. &nbsp;It seems the reason for wanting them to tell the story is two-fold: &nbsp;1) the story that the victim winds up telling is not <i>true</i>, it&#8217;s what has been communicated to them using very sophisticated tools, like military grade information operations, and <i>mind control</i>&nbsp;technology &#8212; this is probably to discredit further testimony from these people, or at least keep it locked up in written record until it is &#8220;needed&#8221;. &nbsp;2) the second purpose of OSEH is to prove to the world, at some future time, that this technology was really being used for nefarious purposes, en masse, across the globe. &nbsp;As a victim, that&#8217;s obvious, because the use of this technology, its existence, and <i>some</i>&nbsp;of its capabilities are proven routinely. &nbsp;As an observer, however, it serves to instill a feeling of disbelief, giving you a <i>reason</i>&nbsp;to discard what would be otherwise valid testimony for a reason that doesn&#8217;t really hold water. &nbsp;The reason is that <i>none of the victims know exactly how it is happening, but most of them are almost positive that they do. &nbsp;</i>There is <i>so much</i>&nbsp;talk on the Internet from &#8220;Targeted Individuals&#8221; about <i>how</i>&nbsp;mind control works, that doesn&#8217;t make any scientific sense, that their claims are dismissed completely as delusion, when in fact the only delusion they have has been imparted to them using mind control.<i>&nbsp;</i>This is by design, and it is the crux of the psychological attack on the general public, that the victims are forced into committing&#8230; against themselves. &nbsp;It&#8217;s very hard to overcome for both sides.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Once <i>mind control capability</i>&nbsp;has been proven to you, the normal response is to research exactly how this is happening, in order to stop it. &nbsp;This is another reason the internet is now littered with falsehoods about how it works, and the garbage that pervades the <i>mind control community</i>&nbsp;is there first and foremost so that knowing victims can do absolutely nothing about it, and second (in my belief) when awareness becomes more broad, that the entire world will have a very difficult time in figuring out how to stop it.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Tomorrow I&#8217;m going to talk about how I first became aware of it, and that will probably seem like a very strange story to you, let me alert you in advance to the fact that its nothing anyone would <i>intentionally make up</i>, it will be the actual story that was told to me, and it&#8217;s somewhat comical.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Today, I&#8217;m going to go through some of the &#8220;research&#8221; available on the internet about &#8220;how&#8221; mind control works, and tell you why I think it makes no sense.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://www.whale.to/b/nsa7.html#Capabilities_of_NSA_Operatives_Using_RNM_">Microwave radiation used to control your mind</a></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://www.whale.to/b/nsa7.html#Capabilities_of_NSA_Operatives_Using_RNM_">http://www.whale.to/b/nsa7.html#Capabilities_of_NSA_Operatives_Using_RNM_</a></div>
<blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align:justify;"><p>One of the more often cited, and &#8220;more technological&#8221; looking articles, the above purports to tell victims that they are being influenced by low frequency microwaves, and that these have the &#8220;capability&#8221; of modifying thoughts, feelings, sight, sound etc. &nbsp;This is reinforced by numerous public articles on things like the Soviet &#8220;woodpecker&#8221; and psychotronics, which the intelligence community would have you believe they thought were attempts and modifying the U.S. population&#8217;s thoughts during the Cold War. &nbsp;It&#8217;s my belief that this was a very well planned and executed cover operation for technology that actually does work.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align:justify;"><p>&nbsp;If you look into neuroscience research, and how the brain actually works, it&#8217;s pretty clear that thoughts and feelings are products of electrical impulses.. the firing of neurons, and how these neurons connect to other neurons, like a very advanced biological integrated circuit. &nbsp;The idea that these impulses can be significantly modified with radio frequency radiation is pretty silly. &nbsp;It&#8217;s even more silly when you realize that in order to change something like a thought, it would require the complex modification of the firing of <i>many very small neurons </i>in a very specific pattern, it would require that neurons surrounding the ones intending to be fired did not accidentally fire, and it would have to be sustained &#8230; indefinitely in order to create the effect that I will be describing. &nbsp;It&#8217;s just not possible to create a <i>mini-EMP</i>&nbsp;that satisfies these requirements.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align:justify;"><p>When you throw in that a great number of victims, myself included, worked feverishly to create electromagnetic shielding in order to <i>stop mind control</i>, it becomes even more apparent that this is not the product of radio frequency. &nbsp;Once you figure out that something strange is happening to you, and you &#8220;find&#8221; the TI community, this is one of the first things you see, and it leads you in the wrong direction, sometimes indefinitely.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>

<blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align:justify;"><p>For decades, there has been a conspiratorial saga revolving around UFO abductions, and implanted devices. &nbsp;This phenomenon was depicted quite accurately in the <a href="http://x-files.wikia.com/wiki/Dana_Scully's_abduction">X-Files</a> in the early 90&#8217;s and while the entire subculture appears to have been removed from the mainstream, it was written and complained about for a significant period of time. &nbsp;Over the last 7 years, similar stories have begun surfacing, this time in relation to OSEH, and mind control abuse. &nbsp;There has always been an opinion that the alien abductions were in fact government operations, disguised in order to shift blame, or worse, as a false flag operation.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align:justify;"><p>The technology being used, because of the sheer breadth and lack of discovery of mass implants, leads me to believe that the cases above are themselves a deceptive operation in order to perpetrate a lie on the general public, and the mind control community. &nbsp;Namely: that microchip or nanotechnology implants are <i>required </i>to do these horrible things. &nbsp;This is supposed to give you a feeling of relief&#8230; &#8220;at least its not happening to you.&#8221; &nbsp;Think again, its been happening en masse for decades, and the OSEH operation is what I call the &#8220;Mark of the Beast&#8221; &#8212; its designed to tell the public a hidden truth, with an obvious analogy. &nbsp;This &nbsp;theme of half truths being used in order to convey a more universal message will be recurring throughout this story.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align:justify;"><p>To be clear, there is also no way an RFID chip could be used to modify&nbsp;the thoughts of an implant victim. &nbsp;&nbsp;It is a red herring, placed there to stop further investigation, or draw attention to mind control, while at the same time deflecting those interested from the real truth: &nbsp;that it&#8217;s use is much more pervasive than you think.</p></blockquote>
<p>Brainwave entrainment, subliminal programming</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align:justify;"><p>Modifying your brainwave frequency, while most likely very possible using audio and visual methods of entrainment will not have a significant impact on your thoughts, state of mind, etc. Try downloading one of these <strike>awesome</strike> programs and figure that out yourself:&nbsp;<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/brain-wave-30-advanced-binaural/id307219387?mt=8">https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/brain-wave-30-advanced-binaural/id307219387?mt=8</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/brainwave-entrainment/id473050783?mt=8">https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/brainwave-entrainment/id473050783?mt=8</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://entrainmentapp.com/">http://entrainmentapp.com/</a>&nbsp;(<i>hint: you will notice nothing.)</i>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Monarch &#8216;programming&#8217;</div>
<blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align:justify;"><p>Personally I&#8217;m of the opinion that the entire MK-Ultra series of tests, including Monarch programming, electroshock, multiple personality &#8220;creation&#8221; and the like were the most &#8220;Satanic&#8221; things to come out of the CIA during the 70&#8217;s. &nbsp;These programs have so little merit, so little grounding in modern neuroscience, that its almost pathetic that these &#8220;agencies&#8221; had the immorality to research them at all, let alone for the length of time that they did. &nbsp;If you don&#8217;t believe any of the other things I call the &#8220;Mark of the Beast&#8221; believe that this is a screaming example of the United States of America performing evil acts for no good reason. &nbsp;By the way, one of the <b><i>big and obvious deceptions</i>&nbsp;</b>in gang-stalking and OSEH is that the victims are being&nbsp;experimented&nbsp;on. &nbsp;Let me tell you a secret: &nbsp;the technology has been perfected for a long, long time. &nbsp;These are not tests, gang-stalking is the full blown operation.</p></blockquote>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Now that I&#8217;ve finished my attempt to tell you why the victim community&#8217;s consensus theories are wrong, let me leave you with what I think. &nbsp;After many personal trials, research, and attempts at creating physical countermeasures (using science.. of course), this is what I&#8217;ve come up with:</div>
<div style="background-color:white;font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, FreeSerif, serif;font-size:15.199999809265px;line-height:16.799999237061px;text-align:justify;">
<blockquote class="tr_bq"><p><b><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1203.0896v2.pdf" style="color:#192372;text-decoration:initial;">Quantum</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://gradworks.umi.com/33/69/3369373.html" style="color:#192372;text-decoration:initial;">Charge</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Eck_phreaking" style="color:#192372;text-decoration:initial;">Phreaking</a>&nbsp;</b><span style="font-size:15.199999809265px;line-height:16.799999237061px;">&nbsp;</span></p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq"><p><b>By entangling to molecules inherent in the structure of neuronal voltage gated ion channels, it is possible to both&nbsp;<i>suppress</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>activate</i>&nbsp;action potentials by conveying charge, via entanglement. &nbsp;These gates can be manipulated, using the brain&#8217;s endogenous ions in order to manipulate thoughts, feelings, desires. &nbsp;It is also<i>&nbsp;possible to fully control&nbsp;</i>and augment the visual, auditory, and motor cortex functions.&nbsp;</b><span style="font-size:15.199999809265px;line-height:16.799999237061px;">&nbsp;</span></p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq"><p>In addition to &#8220;remote control&#8221; of human brains, it should be obvious that the same technology can be used to remotely monitor and manipulate practically any electronic device. &nbsp;This type of attack, similar to two way&nbsp;<i>Van Eck Phreaking</i>, and leading to the chosen name, allows for the currently existing&nbsp;<b>global surveillance infrastructure</b>, which is being hidden from you by silly &#8220;front&#8221; programs like Carnivore, Total Information Awareness, and Echelon. &nbsp;The purpose of these smoke screens is to insulate the population from the reality that this infrastructure has been in place for much longer than you would think, and that the governments of the world are fully capable of remotely reading and writing data on your cell phone, your computer, and your head; 24/7 completely unfettered by conventional electromagnetic shielding or any type of known countermeasure.<span style="font-size:15.199999809265px;line-height:16.799999237061px;">&nbsp;</span></p></blockquote>

</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">The point, the glue that binds these people and stories all together, is that they are <i>very sure</i>&nbsp;that something strange is happening to them, and they are seeking a valid mechanism of action. &nbsp;Some people turn to religion for an answer, others turn to science&#8230; the group of TI&#8217;s seeks a mechanism that they believe they can <i>stop,</i>&nbsp;and in doing so wind up repeating stories and using articles that were shown to them for the specific purpose of confusing them as to how this is happening. &nbsp;They then begin regurgitating this information as fact, and because this is done in concert with their stories of <i>why</i>&nbsp;these things are happening, both are discarded by many. &nbsp;This is a <i>huge problem</i>&nbsp;for everyone, as they can and do give very valid testimony as to their personal experiences.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Many of the &#8216;individual plays&#8217; that are part of the information operation known as OSEH are designed to create the <a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2012/11/how-do-you-know-part-2.html">appearance of insanity</a>, this creates another problem, as the mental health community seems to summarily reject the idea that mind control technology could possible exist &#8212; a pretty unscientific viewpoint. &nbsp;Further, they seem to be driven by standards tests and <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2012/11/30/166252201/weekend-vote-will-bring-controversial-changes-to-psychiatrists-bible">manuals</a>&nbsp;which appear to be designed specifically to discredit testimony regarding advanced technology. &nbsp;For example according to the DSM-5 and the MMPI-2, if you believe &#8220;someone in reading your thoughts&#8221; you are <i>probably a paranoid&nbsp;schizophrenic&nbsp;that requires medication.</i>&nbsp;It should be pointed out that nearly all Christians believe someone can hear their prayers, and that there is a <i>significant</i>&nbsp;amount of public research into this field. &nbsp;I&#8217;m not sure why the psychiatric community appears to be broadly and unanimously unaware of both religion and science.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">The psychiatric community&#8217;s response is another example of a &#8220;Satanic influence.&#8221; &nbsp;In this case, their motivations may not even be maligned, but they are blinded by <i>groupthink</i> &#8212; and this leads them to overlook an obvious truth: &nbsp;group delusion is impossible. &nbsp;There are thousands of victims around the country, who have had no contact with each other, who find a very well hidden and non-mainstream community because of their experiences. &nbsp;The fact that they are able to find each other is proof in itself that they are experiencing a very similar kind of problem, with the same means of execution.</p>
<p><b>The people crying about about being victims of this crime do so in a public forum. &nbsp;They also file complaints with the FBI, CIA, NSA, ACLU, and other agencies. &nbsp;All in all, these complaints and pleas go completely unanswered, unnoticed, and non-investigated. &nbsp;This is not a normal reaction, even if the complainants &#8220;sanity&#8221; is being questioned. &nbsp;The lack of investigation should prove something to you. &nbsp;<i>Think about it.</i></b></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="text-align:justify;">In the middle of 2012, I was set up for a crime I did not commit. &nbsp;This was surrounded by a series of false arrests by police officers working for an extra-governmental organization diametrically opposed to the values of the United States of America. &nbsp;It was a show of force, my belief is with the intent of keeping this story from being told to the authorities. &nbsp;It had the complete opposite effect and marked the end of a very long period of silence on my part, in relation to <i><a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=gang%20stalking">psychological</a> <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=organized%20stalking">torture</a></i> at the hands of the United States of America, and their ally, the American Mafia. &nbsp;This was a minor possession charge, and most people would probably find it insignificant; &nbsp;in the grand scheme of things, it is anything but insignificant, and it is indicative of a growing infestation of collusion and corruption in the American justice system that must be reckoned with. &nbsp;When you understand the reason for the set up, it becomes glaring and disgusting evidence of an unholy alliance between America and crime. &nbsp;The reason is to discredit my testimony, and taint it with &#8220;documented evidence&#8221; that what I have experienced is due to drug use. &nbsp;This is definitely not the case, and its unfortunately a weapon that has been <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eleusinian_Mysteries">used for centuries</a> in order to mask the breadth of power that some unseen force has over the human mind. &nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">This event, at the incapable hands of a small Police department in Florida, is the reason behind what you are reading now, and what you have read for the last few months. &nbsp;I thought I could confer to you the truths I have gleaned from this horrific experience without detailing my sometimes trying, sometimes embarrassing, and sometimes interesting personal story. &nbsp;It&#8217;s been increasingly difficult to convincingly convey the message I want, though, without giving you a significant amount of additional information about how exactly I came to the conclusions I have. &nbsp;So be it. &nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Yesterday I wrote about Satan, and told you it/he was a hidden force, one that exploited human weakness in order to create the effect of a monolithic <i>dark force</i>&nbsp;manipulating humanity. &nbsp;This opinion is from personal experience, and it definitely needs clarification. &nbsp;What I have experienced over the past 2.5 years has proven to me, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that there is a hidden force that has the <a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2012/11/forbidden-knowledge-quantum-charge.html">technology</a>, and the ill-will required to influence the minds of the <i><a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2012/11/nobody-is-mind-controlling-me.html">whole of humanity</a></i>. &nbsp;This is a really big statement, and I&#8217;m not going to get to exactly how I am so sure of this until much later in the story, but for right now please take that at face value, as I will be describing the events of the last two years with that fact in mind. &nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">From my experience, and by now I have a lot, <i>believe me; </i>mind control is a subtle thing. &nbsp;It&#8217;s so subtle that unless it was desired, you would never even know it was happening to you. &nbsp;The reason it is subtle is probably very closely tied to how the brain works, which has been explained to me over the course of the last 2.5 years. &nbsp;You are probably asking yourself why.. and so am I. &nbsp;I have several reasons which make sense to me, but the one that stands out the most is so that I can tell this story to you as convincingly as possible. &nbsp;I&#8217;m going to share much more about it later, but for right now this is the important part:</div>
<blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align:justify;"><p>It&#8217;s possible to change how you feel about things&#8230; big and small&#8230; so transparently that your brain creates its own reasons for the belief. &nbsp;Throughout this experience I&#8217;ve called the specific action being <i>mind controlled</i>&nbsp;a&nbsp;&#8216;button&#8217; that is being pressed, and as an example there could be a &#8216;hate your neighbor&#8217; button. &nbsp;As soon as that button is pressed, your brain instantly searches its memories and feelings, and just because you are feeling that particular way, the reasons you might hate your neighbor become apparent to you&#8230; it&#8217;s like they bubble to the surface, you know why you feel the way you do, and the everything makes sense in the world. &nbsp;Now, if you really have good reasons to hate your neighbor, perhaps they chopped down your favorite apple tree hanging over the fence, this makes perfect sense to you, and you&#8217;d never know it was happening. &nbsp;If you really don&#8217;t have good reasons, it doesn&#8217;t make so much sense. &nbsp;Here&#8217;s the rub: &nbsp;even though it doesn&#8217;t make sense, <i>you still hate your neighbor</i>, its just a little more obvious that there is no particular reason for this feeling. &nbsp; That probably happens to normal people all the time, you just get a &#8216;feeling&#8217; that someone isn&#8217;t &#8216;right&#8217; and take that at face value&#8230; right? &nbsp;Now, I&#8217;m not trying to say that &#8216;intuition&#8217; is wrong, or that it should be ignored all the time &#8212; all I&#8217;m saying is that when you get feelings with no real basis, it&#8217;s probably best to question them&#8230; more often than not.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Why am I telling you this? &nbsp;It goes back to the whole Satan thing. &nbsp;What is happening in our world appears to me to be the work of a single dark force. &nbsp;This force is using advanced technology to influence <i>many different groups</i>&nbsp;to act in what appears to be perfect concert. &nbsp;I think now, that because of what is required in order to manipulate people with mind control, each of these different groups (or individuals) probably has their own reason for doing what they are doing. &nbsp;Sometimes its greed, &nbsp;lust, or jealousy, sometimes it might have something to do with <i>family</i>, and other times it might be about <i>protecting national security</i>&nbsp;&#8212; whatever the reason, it requires them each to have their own story about what is going on, or at least their own special view of the situation. &nbsp;That means someone is deceiving them, and one of the overriding values among the people involved is <i>secrecy. &nbsp;</i>Secret societies, organized crime, and state run law enforcement and intelligence organizations all have their own reasons for <i>not talking about what&#8217;s going on around them</i>&nbsp;&#8212; this is by design, and it keeps these groups from fully realizing the big picture. &nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">The point I am trying to make, of course, is that not talking about it with your peers, and with those outside your profession, is probably making it really easy to confuse you into thinking you are doing something right, or something that benefits you, when in fact what you are doing might be hurting the whole lot of us without your intention. &nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2013/01/what-is-oseh-organized-stalking-and.html">Tomorrow I&#8217;m going to talk</a> a little about <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=organized%20stalking">organized stalking</a> (and <a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2013/01/mind-control-its-all-around-you.html">mind control</a>).. what it is, how it feels, and how easy it might be to keep you from believing it&#8217;s real.</div>
