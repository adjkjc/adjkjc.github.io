										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="text-align:justify;">
<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"><a href="http://www.eff.org/files/eagle_circle_big.png" style="clear:left;float:left;margin-bottom:1em;margin-right:1em;"><img border="0" height="192" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.eff.org/files/eagle_circle_big.png" width="200" /></a></div>
<p><span style="background-color:#fffefd;color:#001320;line-height:21px;"><span style="font-family:Courier New, Courier, monospace;font-size:xx-small;">A lion has come out of his lair; a destroyer of nations has set out. He has left his place to lay waste your land. Your towns will lie in ruins without inhabitant.</span></span><br /><span style="background-color:#fffefd;color:#001320;line-height:21px;"><span style="font-family:Courier New, Courier, monospace;font-size:xx-small;"><br /></span></span><span style="background-color:#fffefd;color:#001320;line-height:21px;"><span style="font-family:Courier New, Courier, monospace;font-size:xx-small;">-Jeremiah 4:7</span></span><br /><span style="background-color:#fffefd;color:#001320;font-family:Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:21px;"><br /></span><span style="font-family:inherit;line-height:.22in;">After pulling into the guard gate marked “Public,” and informing the NSA Police officer guarding the gate that I wished to file an organized crime complaint with the NSA Office of Internal Investigations, the officer asked me first if I thought “they” were the perpetrators of my complaint, and I informed him that I was pretty sure it wasn&#8217;t them, but that the organized crime syndicate, the &#8216;ndrangheta mafia was using advanced technology that could only have come from here, he immediately called for backup and a marked NSA Police explorer pulled up behind me with his lights flashing.  Some land of the free.</span></div>
<div align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="line-height:.22in;margin-bottom:0;margin-left:0;page-break-inside:auto;"><span style="font-family:inherit;"><br /></span></div>
<div align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-bottom:0;margin-left:0;page-break-inside:auto;"><span style="font-family:inherit;"><span style="line-height:.22in;">The uniformed police officers asked me then to pull into a handicapped spot inside the guard gate right in front of the main NSA building.  I did so, and was informed to get out of the car, open my doors and trunk, and allow them to have a dog search the car.  I questioned their authority to do so, and they said simply being on Federal property allowed them to do the search.  Meanwhile, an</span><span style="line-height:.22in;">&nbsp;NSA employee in plain clothes, wearing only an employee ID card around her chest exited from the building and walked towards us. &nbsp;Once she arrived she asked me the purpose of my visit.  I began telling the story, which you have read, and she took careful notes.  </span></span></div>
<div align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="line-height:.22in;margin-bottom:0;margin-left:0;page-break-inside:auto;"><span style="font-family:inherit;"><br /></span></div>
<div align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="line-height:.22in;margin-bottom:0;margin-left:0;page-break-inside:auto;"><span style="font-family:inherit;">Her questions were tainted with overtones of a hidden threat, and I was somewhat surprised that it seemed like standard operating procedure to both her, and the eight NSA Police officers who had surrounded both of us.</span></div>
<div align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="line-height:.22in;margin-bottom:0;margin-left:0;page-break-inside:auto;"><span style="font-family:inherit;"><br /></span></div>
<div align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="line-height:.22in;margin-bottom:0;margin-left:0;page-break-inside:auto;"><span style="font-family:inherit;">Who have you told that you were coming to here?  <i>Seriously, are you the mafia? What kind of question is that? In case you were planning on <a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/last_circle/0.htm">Danny Casolaro</a>&#8216;ing me, I have informed my parents, friends, and acquaintances of my problem and my pending visit to Washington, DC in order to ascertain whether or not the Federal government could assist me with my problem of a drug trafficking organization using <a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2012/11/forbidden-knowledge-quantum-charge.html">quantum charge phreaking</a> to modify my thoughts, feelings, and interfering with electronic communications via cellular phone and the Internet. </i></span></div>
<div align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="line-height:.22in;margin-bottom:0;margin-left:0;page-break-inside:auto;"><span style="font-family:inherit;"><br /></span></div>
<div align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="line-height:.22in;margin-bottom:0;margin-left:0;page-break-inside:auto;"><span style="font-family:inherit;">She repeatedly asked me if I had filed previous Federal complaints, and all times I informed her the only complaint I had filed was in 2011, with the FBI.  She also repeatedly noted that the DEA was also involved, and was either reminded or remembered that the DEA involvement was at the behest of FBI Special Agent Brian X. Blake, not myself.&nbsp;</span></p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq"><p><span style="font-family:inherit;">Her repeated interrogatories about other federal agencies merged to a seam when she informed me that no other federal follow ups were necessary, as the NSA communicated often with the other agencies.  She then cautioned that repeated visits to Federal agencies could result in an arrest for trespass, to which I replied that I had not filed a complaint, or visited a Federal agency about this problem since January of 2011. &nbsp;I felt as if, and I was being threatened. &nbsp;&#8220;Don&#8217;t complain, Adam&#8230; we could have killed you instead.&#8221;</span><span style="line-height:.22in;">&nbsp;</span></p></blockquote>
</div>
<div align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="line-height:.22in;margin-bottom:0;margin-left:0;page-break-inside:auto;"><span style="font-family:inherit;">Where else have you gone, and where do you plan on going? <i> I informed her that I planned on visiting several other Federal agencies, including the Central Intelligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice, and the Press.  She then inquired, </i>“what press agencies?,” <i>The New York Times, the Washington Post, and several others.&nbsp;</i></span><br /><span style="font-family:inherit;"><i><br /></i></span><span style="font-family:inherit;"><i>She made no comment about the press.</i></span></div>
<div align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="line-height:.22in;margin-bottom:0;margin-left:0;page-break-inside:auto;"><span style="font-family:inherit;"><br /></span></div>
<div align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="line-height:.22in;margin-bottom:0;margin-left:0;page-break-inside:auto;"><span style="font-family:inherit;">How do your parents feel about your visit?  Do they have differing opinions?  <i>This hits a chord in my psyche, sending dark chills down my spine.  My parents had, despite my repeated fervent cries for understanding, repeatedly expressed their disbelief of Mafia involvement in my relationship with Mary, and their use of technology which I certainly  believed they should not have access to in order to unduly coerce the law enforcement arms of both the Federal and State governments. It should be noted here that Mary&#8217;s brother was recently, just before our relationship reignited, arrested for criminal drug trafficking, and her uncle Tony had recently been arrested by the FBI in New York City for “Mafia extortion and coercion.”  Their continued disbelief baffled me, and I was unable to reconcile the fact that they are the people that know me best in the world, raised me – I was a product of their upbringing – could possibly take my first hand testimony and disregard it.&nbsp;</i></span></div>
<div align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="line-height:.22in;margin-bottom:0;margin-left:0;page-break-inside:auto;"><span style="font-family:inherit;"><i><br /></i></span></div>
<div align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="line-height:.22in;margin-bottom:0;margin-left:0;page-break-inside:auto;"><span style="font-family:inherit;">The NSA Employee also specifically commented on the fact that disbelief by loved ones is a difficult thing to cope with, silently telling me that she, or whomever she was communicating with, was aware of the frequent battles in my home over the truth. Sometimes I personally forget, but its important to remember that we are living in 2012, and it has been 77 years since the discovery of quantum entanglement, and innovation in the public sector in the field of physics and neuroscience has basically slowed to a crawl.  It should be noted that scientific innovation should probably progress at a pace similar to Moore&#8217;s law, and a decrease in acceleration of discovery should and would trouble the Federal government just as it did during the Cold War when the Soviet&#8217;s launched a space satellite before we were scientifically able to.   </span></div>
<div align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="line-height:.22in;margin-bottom:0;margin-left:0;page-break-inside:auto;"><span style="font-family:inherit;"><br /></span></div>
<div align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="margin-bottom:0;margin-left:0;page-break-inside:auto;"><span style="font-family:inherit;"><span style="line-height:.22in;">Several times during my conversation with the plain clothesed NSA agent, she would take a phone call from a third party, excuse her self very politely, and walk towards her unmarked vehicle, which was&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height:21.106666564941px;">conveniently</span><span style="line-height:.22in;">&nbsp;parked only a few feet away, prior to my entry.  On one occasion, she returned and made a comment to one of the uniformed officers that she was “thinking” that maybe calling a “Taxi” would be appropriate.  My thoughts raced, thinking that she was attempting to call an ambulance and have me placed under psychiatric care – I scrambled, and suggested that perhaps she would like some of my background.  I informed her that I was a National Merit Scholar, got a 1430 on my SAT&#8217;s (when they were out of 1600), and that I had gone to a prestigious private school in Florida in an attempt to add credibility to my statements.  I further informed her that there was a myriad of documented evidence that would make my claims of an attempted setup very provable, and that my story had sincere credibility in the fact that I was not charged with a crime at the time of my initial complaint to the FBI. </span></span></div>
<div align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="line-height:.22in;margin-bottom:0;margin-left:0;page-break-inside:auto;"><span style="font-family:inherit;"><br /></span></div>
<div align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="line-height:.22in;margin-bottom:0;margin-left:0;page-break-inside:auto;"><span style="font-family:inherit;">After I answered her questions, she informed me that my plans to visit several other Federal agencies, including the CIA, she said I would receive no written follow up from her, and that she was unable to take anything in writing from me, as I had prepared a full written complaint, in the form of a book which discussed the nefarious operations of the Mafia and its use of mind control in order to discredit the testimony of civilians against them, and their knowledge and use of top secret government technology.  I informed her that because I was not receiving a written report, thinking that there would be no written record of my visit, that I would need to file this complaint again with the FBI.  She reiterated her slightly veiled threat of arrest for trespass on Federal property, to which I replied that I believed the FBI did take walk-in complaints.  She did not disagree.</span></div>
<div align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="line-height:.22in;margin-bottom:0;margin-left:0;page-break-inside:auto;"><span style="font-family:inherit;"><br /></span></div>
<div align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="line-height:.22in;margin-bottom:0;margin-left:0;page-break-inside:auto;"><span style="font-family:inherit;">After the majority of the complaint and conversation had been completed, the NSA employee, who reminded me of a psychologist, began making “small talk” and asking me what I liked to do in my spare time, what TV shows I liked, and what my favorite movie was.  After drawing a blank on the TV show question, and feeling somewhat frustrated internally, because I knew my memory was being suppressed with min control, she began asking specific shows. &nbsp;She asked me if I liked Stargate SG-1, the series &#8220;V&#8221;, Ancient Aliens, and Chuck. &nbsp;I was floored.. these were my favorite shows, I had watched them all religiously and it was clear to me that her intent was to inform me that the NSA was able to <b>know</b>&nbsp;what television programs I watched. &nbsp;I told her that the &#8220;Devil&#8217;s Advocate&#8221; was currently my favorite movie, but I also held the &#8220;Usual Suspects&#8221; and &#8220;A Few Good Men&#8221; in high regard. &nbsp;She responded by asking if I liked &#8220;The Day The Earth Stood Still.&#8221; &nbsp;</span></div>
<blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align:justify;"><p><span style="font-family:inherit;">It wasn&#8217;t clear to me at the time I was there, but it&#8217;s now so obvious that the list of shows she mentioned were targeted, they describe a clear picture of the world that I have been plunged in to&#8230; a hidden battle between an alien influence and humanity, one that nobody really knows about. &nbsp;It ties in advanced technology and religion, and its clear that her purpose for sharing this information was to make me <b>know</b>&nbsp;that they &#8220;<b>know&#8221;.</b></span></p></blockquote>
<div align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="line-height:.22in;margin-bottom:0;margin-left:0;page-break-inside:auto;"><span style="font-family:inherit;">While I was being questioned, I repeatedly looked at several of the officers, who would respond with silent nods at my story at every glance.  I was not sure whether or not they agreed with my position, or if they were holding me in disdain for complaining about the questionable actions of fellow law enforcement officers.  Everyone on the scene was cordial and professional, aside from the NSA employee who, while maintaining a professional demeanor, was most definitely communicating with someone else using the same covert communication system that the gang-stalkers used, and was most certainly taking every opportunity to not only silently inform me of the governments complicity in this conspiracy, but also that they had no intention of doing the right thing.  On the morning of October 17, 2012; the day after my visit to the NSA, I sit on the streets of Washington, DC wondering how it is that our great country has fallen to criminals without anyone knowing or caring.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="line-height:.22in;margin-bottom:0;margin-left:0;page-break-inside:auto;"><span style="font-family:inherit;"><i><br /></i></span></div>
<div align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="line-height:.22in;margin-bottom:0;margin-left:0;page-break-inside:auto;"><span style="font-family:Courier New, Courier, monospace;font-size:x-small;">Fallen, fallen, is Babylon the great!  She has become a dwelling place for demons, a haunt for every unclean spirit.</span></div>
<div align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="line-height:.22in;margin-bottom:0;margin-left:0;page-break-inside:auto;"><span style="font-family:inherit;"><br /></span></div>
<div align="JUSTIFY" class="western" style="line-height:.22in;margin-bottom:0;margin-left:0;page-break-inside:auto;"><span style="font-family:inherit;">This visit will mark the end of what I thought was my valiant attempt to alert the Federal government of a National Security problem that existed between corrupt government employees and organized crime syndicates.  It seems almost impossible for the entire “door crew” of the NSA to have been unduly compromised by the organization I had previously believed to be responsible for the troubles that I have been an undesiring and undeserving witness of.  For the last three years, I have been under the false impression that my assailants were employed by a private institution, and it is now clear to me that they are most likely not.  A fight with the most powerful entity on the face of the Earth is not exactly what I set out to accomplish, and it is my sincere hope that despite living in a very strange time, the innate goodness of humanity will prevail, and at least some form of justice will be had.</span></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="text-align:justify;">Over the past three years I have been heavily attacked with mind control technology, and by a legion of people &#8212; some working for the government, who appear to be attempting to <b>engineer Revelation. &nbsp;</b>I am an OSEH (organized stalking and electronic harassment) victim, and like many others, believe that the phenomenon is tied to the Biblical entity known as Satan. &nbsp;In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/2021-Times-Battle-between-Machine/dp/1480169994">my book</a> on this subject, I put forward a theory that this entity is in fact an advanced computer, of alien origin, that was left here many thousands of years ago. &nbsp;I wrote the book after being delivered a &#8220;Revelation&#8221; regarding George Orwell, 1984, and much of the information that has been posted on this blog. &nbsp; &nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">The entire contents of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/2021-Times-Battle-between-Machine/dp/1480169994">the book</a> were delivered to me via OSEH, some by &#8220;actors&#8221; in the real world, and some directly with synthetic telepathy, which I had not received until very recently. &nbsp;I am now writing the story leading up to the writing of the book, and calling it &#8220;Engineering Revelation.&#8221; &nbsp;Some of this story is posted on this blog. &nbsp;The original book was written in only one week, with the assistance of a great deal of <b>mind control, </b>which some might have considered &#8220;divine inspiration&#8221; at one point. &nbsp;I had been threatened repeatedly prior to writing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/2021-Times-Battle-between-Machine/dp/1480169994">The End Times</a>, and while I had a significant amount of personal and urgent issues to deal with at the time of its writing, because of renewed and much more serious threats from the organized staking perpetrators, I chose to focus on &nbsp;the most important issue. &nbsp;I believed that if I only had one thing left to do, it was to warn humanity about <b>where to look</b>&nbsp;to solve a problem that I believe will be becoming very public in the next 4 or 5 years, and that is the goal of the original book. &nbsp;The answer is up, and to Sirius. &nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">During the torturous period where this information was <i>delivered</i>&nbsp;to me, I was reminded somewhat constantly via a maelstrom of electronic messagesr to &#8220;consider the source.&#8221; &nbsp;After reflecting, I feel it&#8217;s necessary to clarify the <i>theory</i>&nbsp;I put forward in the book. &nbsp;It now appears that this theory, which I believe has been <b>intentionally left in our history</b>&nbsp;regarding the possibility of advanced alien technology being <b>earthbound</b>&nbsp;during our history may be part of a very old <b>information operation</b>&nbsp;designed to blame the United States of America for creating the psycho-surveillance infrastructure in 1984. &nbsp;I now believe that this infrastructure has been in place, in space, for a very long time; and that the alien force responsible for OSEH and &#8220;hiding&#8221; it&#8217;s trail in our history did it in order to create a Biblical <b>scapegoat, </b>one that humanity will require saving from at some point in the future. This is the &#8216;gist&#8217; of the <b>false flag attack</b>&nbsp;I wrote about in <i><a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2012/11/tale-of-hidden-coup.html">Tale of a Hidden Coup</a></i>.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">The story of Revelation tells me that during the &#8220;End Times&#8221; the technology platform used in old world phenomenon like <b>demonic possession </b>and <b>divine inspiration</b>&nbsp;were <i>given</i>&nbsp;to humanity. &nbsp;I still believe this to be correct, however it seems that there is much more deception involved than meets the eye. &nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">The <a href="http://unduecoercion.org/p/silence-betrayal_10.html">next book</a> will convey the truth of how, and&nbsp;<b>why,&nbsp;</b>I experienced this Revelation with an emphasis on maintaining a sincere conveyance of truth. &nbsp;It&#8217;s goal is to inform the world about the existence of a &#8220;Satanic&#8221; organization, give my testimony related to what they are actually doing, and help&nbsp;<i>everyone</i>&nbsp;figure out what to do at the end of the story.</div>

<div style="text-align:justify;">Since writing <b><i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/2021-Times-Battle-between-Machine/dp/1480169994">The End Times</a></i>, </b>a significant amount of new information has been given to me. &nbsp;I had originally chosen <b>2021</b>&nbsp;as the year of the &#8220;second coming&#8221; by reversing the logic George Orwell used to come up with the title 1984. &nbsp;Since then I have been given what I believe are the <a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2012/12/broken-seals-of-revelation.html">key to the Seal of Revelation 6, and posted in on 12/12/12</a> on this blog. &nbsp;There are many references to this seal throughout the Bible, and I believe that Daniel&#8217;s reference to it delivers a new date (range) for the coming of the &#8220;Ancient of Days&#8221;. &nbsp;Both the Illuminati and the alien artificial intelligence which is .. fulfilling this prophesy are&nbsp;<b>infatuated</b>&nbsp;with symmetry in numbers and synchronicity. </p>

<div style="text-align:justify;">In my book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/2021-Times-Battle-between-Machine/dp/1480169994">2021-2041 The End Times</a>, I discuss these reliefs heavily. &nbsp;Armed with the knowledge of the <b>existence of mind control of alien origin</b>, the story told by these reliefs begin to make sense. &nbsp; &nbsp;They are a message from Ancient Egypt to our modern time, that they knew of the existence of mind control, that it was responsible for creating their occult religion, and they tell a very clear story. &nbsp;It is not clear to me whether or not this story is a recording of a historical event, or a prophesy of a future event; however knowing that mind control is still being used in much the same way as they depicted it in the reliefs, <i>I hope it is an alternative to the story of <b>Revelation</b></i>. &nbsp;Regardless of whether or not the stories were meant to be related, they both share the common principles of mechanical mind control being used in order to subvert the will of the human civilization. &nbsp;This explanation of the device depicted in the Dendera reliefs makes much more sense to me than the fringe &#8220;light bulb&#8221; explanation, and complements the mainstream mythological explanation. &nbsp;Much of the myth&#8217;s of ancient Egypt depict accurately the use of advanced technology by observers who would have known it as nothing less than powerful magic.</div>

<div style="text-align:justify;">The <i>Light </i>of the reliefs are coupled with the snake, an animal deified in the Egyptian religion and paralleling Satan&#8217;s possession in the Biblical story of the Fall of Man in Eden. &nbsp;I believe the use of the snake both symbolizes the &#8220;divine&#8221; source of the magic the reliefs describe, as well as its nefarious purpose which is <b>obvious</b>&nbsp;when you look at the reliefs.</div>

<div style="text-align:justify;"><span style="background-color:white;font-size:x-small;">The &#8220;cable&#8221; is described in the text beside the depiction as a symbolic sun barge moving across the sky (in a form which is by no means unique to these carvings). It seems to be a bit of a stretch to describe this as a cable, although I suppose you could argue that the movement of the sun mirrored the movement of electricity. However, the &#8220;cable&#8221; is attached to what proponents describe as a &#8220;socket&#8221;, but is in fact a lotus flower. This flower appears in this form all over Egypt, and is always a lotus flower. Furthermore, the text beside the depiction confirms that it is a lotus flower. &nbsp;</span><span style="background-color:white;font-size:x-small;">Sylvie Caulville worked extensively on the inscriptions in the temple.

<div style="text-align:justify;">The inscription is clearly an ancient and uninformed description of a satellite, a &#8220;sun barge&#8221; moving across the sky. &nbsp;The Priests of the Hathor Temple were recording the location of the source of the mind control technology which they are depicting. &nbsp;This relief is an explanation of the story of the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt, brought about by Horus, an earlier diety of virgin birth and likely predecessor of Jesus Christ.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">In this relief, the wielders of the technology are show as giants, like the Nephilim of Genesis 6:4, and are representative of Horus and Set from IHS myth. &nbsp;The humans beneath the light are clearly depicted as worshiping the giants, and when contrasted with the next image in the reliefs shows their clear belief that the light was responsible for <b>causing </b>worship. &nbsp;This is the&nbsp;essence&nbsp;of <b>mind control</b>. &nbsp;In addition, both sides of the relief above depict assistance from third parties, on one side it is being helped by a human like figure, with a circle over its head. &nbsp;This circle is representative of <b>knowledge of mind control</b>, and the human-like figure is a representation of what we call the Illuminati. &nbsp;On the other side of the image, the cable is hidden, and instead of humans the mind control&nbsp;<i>light</i>, is being assisted by a djed pillar with arms, a representation of a machine.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">When taken with the next relief, it is possible that there is a hidden meaning on the walls of the Hathor Temple, that the relief above describes a time sequence, and each section is a slide showing the progression of mind control throughout history, it <i>may be </i>a grand prophesy about the entirety of human evolution. &nbsp;If this is the case, the humans depicted show the gradual hiding of the knowledge of the satellite described by the cable, and the vanishing of knowledge of mind control from humanity. &nbsp;Clearly though , from the continued worship in the second half, and the presence of the snake and light, it has not been stopped.</div>

<div style="text-align:justify;">The above relief is the final in the temporal slideshow, describing the fate of humanity. In it, a third party, represented by a giant that is clearly <i>different</i>&nbsp;from the depictions of Horus and Set in the first stands against the mind control technology using a pair of swords. These swords are the cue that links this force with the Archangel Michael, and are also a testament to the fact that there is a technology, or a tool, which can counteract the mind controlling <i>light</i>.&nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">The relief shows that after the assistance of this outside force, humanity shown in <b>friendship </b>rather than worship, that civilization has been healed. &nbsp;It&#8217;s also important to note that in the final relief the &#8220;Illuminati&#8221; and the machine are working together, against the representation of Michael.</div>

He is usually depicted wearing a crown of ram horns surmounted by high plumes, sun disks and cobras.

Mandulis, as represented on its walls, does not seem at all out of place among the other members of the Egyptain pantheon placed in his company. From the &#8220;Vision of Mandulis&#8221; we find the unforced equation of this Nubian solar deity to Egyptian&nbsp;<a href="http://www.touregypt.net/godsofegypt/horus.htm" style="color:#0066cc;margin:0;outline:none;padding:0;">Horus</a>&nbsp;and to the Greek Apollo.</div>
