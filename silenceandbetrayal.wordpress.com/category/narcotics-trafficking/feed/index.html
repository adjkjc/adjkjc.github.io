That millions were murdered in multiple genocides for the remainder of that century, and that governments became tyrannical and oppressive</span><span class="text_exposed_show" style="background-color:white;color:#333333;display:inline;font-family:'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif;font-size:13.333333969116px;line-height:17.981481552124px;">. We can <i>pretend</i> that the United States murdered millions of innocent civilians in Japan, and the world barely cared. Later it might be fun to <i>pretend</i> that the defenders of freedom in that war were secretly infested by their enemy, and became fascist regimes who used democracy as the new opiate of the masses.</span><br /><span class="text_exposed_show" style="background-color:white;color:#333333;display:inline;font-family:'lucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif;font-size:13.333333969116px;line-height:17.981481552124px;"><br />After we can <i>pretend</i> that there is censorship in the media, nobody really knows, and that in the beginning of the 21st century, the United States started wars to steal oil, nationalized the financial and auto industries, and told the general public they were the largest cocaine trafficker in the world. Let&#8217;s all pretend that the reason for this war, was that the American government paid and trained CIA assets to hijack some aircraft, and used them to murder their own citizens to create hysteria.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s <i>pretend</i> that deep down, everybody knows that all this stuff is true, and says nothing.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="text-align:justify;"><b>IHS</b>: Isis, Horus, Set &#8212; The&nbsp;<i>Unholy</i>&nbsp;Trinity</p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq"><p><a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2012/11/ihs-and-unholy-war-part-i.html">Part 1</a>: Ancient Egypt<br /><a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2012/11/ihs-and-unholy-war-part-2.html">Part 2</a>: The Cold War<br /><a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2012/12/ihs-and-unholy-war-part-3.html">Part 3</a>:&nbsp;Organized Crime<br /><a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2012/11/ihs-and-unholy-wars-part-4.html">Part 4</a>: Armageddon</p></blockquote>
<p>Temporally speaking, this is the last installment of the IHS series, it is also the most important as it is the one that is most pertinent to <i>our struggle, and&nbsp;</i>with the most parallels to the actual Isis/Horus/Set story, which I will go over again briefly &nbsp;to refresh your memory. &nbsp;The IHS phenomenon is the historical artifact of the influence of alien mind control technology on human conflicts, and the pervasive truth that this <i>hidden force</i>&nbsp;attempts to <i>play both sides</i>&nbsp;of most conflicts, using its influence in order to control the outcome of the conflict.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">In ancient Egypt, the unification of the Upper and Lower Kingdoms clearly shows that the victorious nation is not always the clear winner.&nbsp;<span style="background-color:white;font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, FreeSerif, serif;line-height:14.39999961853px;text-align:justify;">Not so hidden, between the lines, is the fact that the unification of Egypt resulted in the&nbsp;</span><i style="background-color:white;font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, FreeSerif, serif;line-height:14.39999961853px;text-align:justify;">ideological and religious beliefs of the loser&nbsp;</i><span style="background-color:white;font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, FreeSerif, serif;line-height:14.39999961853px;text-align:justify;">being adopted by the winner, essentially swinging the battle without having to win a physical war. &nbsp;</span><i style="background-color:white;font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, FreeSerif, serif;line-height:14.39999961853px;text-align:justify;">The Cult of Horus (and Lower Egypt) was the clear winner,&nbsp;</i><span style="background-color:white;font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, FreeSerif, serif;line-height:14.39999961853px;text-align:justify;">despite what history tells us. &nbsp;IHS uses&nbsp;</span><i style="background-color:white;font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, FreeSerif, serif;line-height:14.39999961853px;text-align:justify;">humanity against itself,&nbsp;</i><span style="background-color:white;font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, FreeSerif, serif;line-height:14.39999961853px;text-align:justify;">and ensures that the xeno-influence is always dominant.</span></div>
<p><span style="background-color:white;font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, FreeSerif, serif;line-height:14.39999961853px;text-align:justify;"><br /></span></p>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman, Times, FreeSerif, serif;"><span style="line-height:14.39393901825px;">This is especially pertinent in our current story, as the end of the second world war, and the cold war resulted in an infestation of un-American ideals throughout the United States of America, predominantly due to the infiltration of our institutions &#8212; from universities to the congress, by Nazi and Soviet spies whose agenda was literally a hidden revolution. &nbsp;Some believe this revolution succeeded.</span></span></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman, Times, FreeSerif, serif;"><span style="line-height:14.39393901825px;"><br /></span></span></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman, Times, FreeSerif, serif;"><span style="line-height:14.39393901825px;">During the Cold War, both the KGB and the CIA would begin an <i>unholy alliance</i>&nbsp;with organized crime for different reasons. &nbsp;The KGB&#8217;s union would be to aid in their infiltration of American democracy, however the CIA would marry to evil for another reason &#8212; to enable it to hide its secret machinations from not only the American people, but also the Congress of the United States, and the Office of Management and Budget. &nbsp;It would be this unholy bond which would eventually bring American values and liberties to its knees, and put the final nail in the coffin of &#8220;representative democracy.&#8221; &nbsp;I would be remiss in not mentioning here, the high probability of significant MI-6 involvement in the aiding of SD and KGB infiltration of the American way of life in the years during and after World War II.</span></span></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman, Times, FreeSerif, serif;"><span style="line-height:14.39393901825px;"><br /></span></span></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman, Times, FreeSerif, serif;"><span style="line-height:14.39393901825px;">Before I get into the significant details, which span pretty much every major American scandal from the assassination of John F. Kennedy to the Fake Depression of 2008, let me point out that the <i>mark of the beast</i>, tacit written proof of the involvement of the American Mafia with the upper echelon of the United States of America is written all over the records of the public financial markets. &nbsp;From the 1988 crash, to the short sales in the days prior to 9/11, to the significant and obvious manipulation of the real estate and oil commodity markets in 2008; organized crime controlled interests proved time and again prescient knowledge, and complicity in the &#8220;seemingly&#8221; odd machinations of American markets. &nbsp;Worse, the manipulation of the Treasury market and the US Dollar in open foreign exchange, prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that it was more than private interests involved, but also the full weight of the Federal Reserve in the manipulation of these markets. &nbsp;This is further proven by the lack of prosecution of the manipulation of the markets on 9/11 and the crude market in 2008.</span></span></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman, Times, FreeSerif, serif;"><span style="line-height:14.39393901825px;"><br /></span></span></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman, Times, FreeSerif, serif;"><span style="line-height:14.39393901825px;">Now, on to the dirty. &nbsp;The unholy alliance between treasonous members of the United States government, organized crime, and corporate interests like <i>Wackenhut, Hadron, and the Cabazon band of Indians.</i></span></span></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman, Times, FreeSerif, serif;"><span style="line-height:14.39393901825px;"><br /></span></span></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman, Times, FreeSerif, serif;"><span style="line-height:14.39393901825px;">The Central Intelligence Agency has been involved in narcotics trafficking since World War II, back when it was a baby and called the OSS. &nbsp;The Vietnam War was the single largest trafficking operation in U.S. history, and it was this war which brought together a gang of agents, working at one point out of a CIA outpost in Turkey, in a Dark Alliance with the mafia, for the purpose of subverting the fake <i>war on drugs.</i>&nbsp; Shackley, Richard Secord, Tom Clines, William Colby and others would be yet another link between the <a href="http://www.conspiracyplanet.com/channel.cfm?channelid=35&amp;contentid=4023&amp;page=2">CIA and the mafia</a>, known associates of Sam Giancana, and would also create more evidence of their involvement in the assassination of John F. Kennedy and the framing of Richard M. Nixon.</span></span></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman, Times, FreeSerif, serif;"><span style="line-height:14.39393901825px;"><br /></span></span></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman, Times, FreeSerif, serif;"><span style="line-height:14.39393901825px;">This &#8220;Secret Team,&#8221; which is the unpopular media&#8217;s term for the group which was committing routine treason for the benefit of the &#8220;New World Order,&#8221; and the alien intelligence in control of the advanced technology used for mind control, would rear its ugly head again in American scandal during the Carter/Reagan transition. &nbsp;The October Surprise, and the subsequent <a href="http://www.shmoop.com/reagan-era/edwin-meese.html">Iran Contra</a> Scandal, would like them to then Vice President George H.W. Bush, <a href="http://www.american-buddha.com/last.circle.11.htm">Edwin</a> <a href="http://dmc.members.sonic.net/sentinel/gvcon7.html">Meese</a>, and known mafia personalities <a href="http://www.opednews.com/Diary/The-Last-Circle-Welcome-t-by-Ed-Encho-101215-343.html">Eugene Giaquinto and John Gotti.</a>&nbsp; This also brings the Illuminati to Hollywood!</span></span></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman, Times, FreeSerif, serif;"><span style="line-height:14.39393901825px;"><br /></span></span></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman, Times, FreeSerif, serif;"><span style="line-height:14.39393901825px;">These events tie together the American Mafia, members of the Reagan Bush administration, large corporate interests, oil interests, narcotics trafficking, and private sector weapons development AND complete non-prosecution of crimes complete with murder laden cover ups. &nbsp;<i>Hello Illuminati.</i></span></span></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman, Times, FreeSerif, serif;"><span style="line-height:14.39393901825px;"><i><br /></i></span></span></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman, Times, FreeSerif, serif;"><span style="line-height:14.37878704071px;">Later on authors like Gary Webb would detail this groups infiltration into the judicial system <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dark-Alliance-Contras-Cocaine-Explosion/dp/1888363932">at all levels</a></i>, and events like 9/11 would show that they have no regard for America at all. &nbsp;In 2008, organized crime would assist the &#8220;new&#8221; United American Empire in secretly nationalizing the financial sector, the auto makers, and many other private industries. &nbsp;Financial transactions have linked organized crime to the 9/11 short sales, the manipulation of the crude oil market, and massive bear raids on the banks. &nbsp;Thank the FDIC for assisting them in <i>blowing up several huge American financial institutions, </i>making their trades much more profitable. &nbsp; Some say hindsight is 20/20, but when you have the American Government to back up your illegal trades, foresight is even more profitable.</span></span></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman, Times, FreeSerif, serif;"><span style="line-height:14.39393901825px;"><i><br /></i></span></span></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman, Times, FreeSerif, serif;"><span style="line-height:14.37878704071px;">In the wake of the contrived fall of the USSR, and in an eerie parallel to the original IHS story, leaving un-American interests in practical control of the helm of the United States Federal government, this secret organization would begin making their boldest move yet. &nbsp;They would enlarge their civilian army of <i>mind controlled associates</i>, and begin spreading even further knowledge of the governments involvement with the mafia, and an <i>alien influence</i>&nbsp;alluded to by Ronald Reagan numerous times in public addresses. &nbsp;Knowledge of <i>mind control technology</i>&nbsp;would be spread far and wide into the private sector, to the point where now a significant percentage of Americans are aware of a <i>mind controlled coup d&#8217;etat. &nbsp;</i>At some point they probably planned on blaming MI-6 or the KGB for this fiasco, but the infestation is so large now that it would never be believed once exposed. &nbsp;This organization is using <i>mind control technology</i>&nbsp;to steal your money, your civil liberties, and your children&#8217;s future &#8212; out from right under your noses.</span></span></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman, Times, FreeSerif, serif;"><span style="line-height:14.37878704071px;"><br /></span></span></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman, Times, FreeSerif, serif;"><span style="line-height:14.37878704071px;">We all owe Danny Casolaro and Cheri Seymour a huge debt of gratitude for not only exposing this secret coup, but also for linking together the JFK assassination, the Watergate Scandal, the October Surprise, and Iran Contra, in the United States of America&#8217;s <i><a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/last_circle/0.htm">Last Circle</a>.</i></span></span></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman, Times, FreeSerif, serif;"><span style="line-height:14.39393901825px;">This is what is in control of your American Government. &nbsp;It&#8217;s criminal and treasonous. &nbsp;Care, it will not be OK for our children if you don&#8217;t.</span></span></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman, Times, FreeSerif, serif;"><span style="line-height:14.39393901825px;"><br /></span></span></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, we have spent a significant amount of effort telling you all the bad things mind control can, and most probably is doing to you, and the world around you. &nbsp;It&#8217;s a sad state of affairs, in our mind, that such a powerful tool would be used by .. the powers that be .. to do something so awful to so many people. &nbsp;We&#8217;re not just talking about organized stalking, and the MK-Ultra style abuse that <i>is definitely</i>&nbsp;going on, but also about what we believe is a broad and uniform use of this technology in order to hide some very significant realities from the common people. &nbsp;It&#8217;s a little bit like <i>The Matrix</i>, we are all moving through the motions, going to work, going home, sleeping; however if you take a step back, there is something very nefarious going on &#8212; right under your nose. &nbsp;The problem we now face is: it&#8217;s not the movies, and we don&#8217;t have Keanu Reaves to save us.</p>
<p>The great dilemma of our time is that this mind control technology is being used to hide a great atrocity from you, the fact that this technology is not being used for your benefit, but instead to control you. &nbsp;I know it&#8217;s called mind control, but it could do so much more. &nbsp;There&#8217;s so many people aware of it&#8217;s use, and none of them are speaking out either, about the possible species changing gains it could help bring about, nor about the poor way it is currently being used. </p>
<p>Mind control technology, the kind being used by the governments of the world right now, has the capability to bring about a transhumanist metamorphosis of humanity, an evolutionary leap so great it would practically trump biological evolution in potential progress and benefit. &nbsp;It is <i>destiny changing, </i>if in the right hands.</p>
<p>Phillip K. Dick, who in my humble opinion, was clear recipient of a significant amount of mind control in his life &#8212; from a great amount of inspiration, to an attack of paranoia very similar to modern day gang-stalking. &nbsp;His prophetic works of art, however, offer our generation a glimpse into the possibilities we have before us, and a warning about the disaster the government has given you, against your will. &nbsp;In <i>A Scanner Darkly, </i>Dick describes a world where the government is watching us in a very similar manner to Orwell&#8217;s <i>1984</i>, and is using a very pervasive surveillance infrastructure in order to hide narcotics trafficking, and also in order to.. subvert the distribution of those narcotics. &nbsp;That reality, unfortunately, is very similar to the one that is being hidden from you, today. &nbsp;This is a reality that needs to change, very badly. &nbsp;This subversion has worked its way through the ranks of our Judicial system, to the point where most lawyers and &#8230; participants in that system will definitely personally admit, and might even tell you &#8212; our justice system <b><i>sucks.</i></b><br /><b><i><br /></i></b>Phillip K Dick, did give us a better alternative though. &nbsp;It might be an unpopular world-view now, but the system in place in <i>Minority Report</i>&nbsp;would do us all<i style="font-weight:bold;">&nbsp;alot</i>&nbsp;of good today. &nbsp;It was a world where crime could be mostly eliminated, either through the use of a time machine, or simply by <i>fixing our big problem.</i>&nbsp; What problem? &nbsp;Well, its been about greed and lust for power since the beginning, and nothing has changed now. &nbsp;Mind control could offer us a world where people were <i>better</i>, greed would be reduced, <i>love thy neighbor</i>&nbsp;would actually mean something, and our society might actually flourish without constant wars and hatred. &nbsp;Isaiah the Prophet talked about a Second Covenant with God, and this vision is very similar in substance. &nbsp;The Second Covenant he spoke of is most likely a plausible alternative to the tragedy of Revelation that so many people are either expecting or dreading in the coming.. well.. few weeks. &nbsp;James Cameron told us &#8220;the future is not written,&#8221; and lets all hope that we don&#8217;t deal with the very bleak future that was delivered in Revelation.</p>
<p>In <i>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep</i>, or as most of you probably know it <i>Bladerunner,&nbsp;</i>Dick told us of a world where people could control their own minds &#8212; almost like a TV remote, choosing emotions or feelings that they desired to have. &nbsp;This too, is well within our grasp, and <i>mind control</i>&nbsp;has the ability to increase content and happiness, at the push of a button. &nbsp;&#8220;Bliss on tap,&#8221; if you can hear Al Pacino saying it, in another popular film.</p>
<p>Mind control could make you happy doing your job, and more efficient doing it. &nbsp;We could actually live in a productive society, instead of the world of global stagnation and unemployment that lays before you.</p>
<p>It could make those with a dependence problem, simply not have one anymore. &nbsp;Conversely, in our current world, it appears that the government might actually be augmenting their narcotics trafficking business with a strange program of <i>increasing the desire of those in certain situations to want to harm themselves &#8212; against their will.</i></p>
<p>It could make those with neurological disorders, like Parkinson&#8217;s, Asberger&#8217;s, Alzheimer&#8217;s, and Schizophrenia&nbsp;<i>all better, instantly. &nbsp;</i>It could also completely remove pain from the lives of pretty much anyone. &nbsp;Instead of &#8230; giving a sitting American President a neurological disease, so that another one can <i>sell narcotics.</i></p>
<p>It could significantly increase tactile stimulation (I&#8217;m trying to be PG-13 here).</p>
<p>And if you are a computer scientist like me, you might enjoy an actual BCI &#8212; Brain Computer Interface &#8212; never lose your TV remote again, and type at the speed of thought&#8230;</p>
<p>Which could be <i>thousands</i>&nbsp;of times faster! &nbsp;Mind control could make <i>everyone</i>&nbsp;smarter. &nbsp;Faster thoughts, better memories, and instant access to new and correct knowledge. &nbsp;It could eliminate the need for <i>studying</i>&nbsp;and download information directly into the cerebral cortex. &nbsp;<i>Instead of intentionally making the population stupid.</i></p>
<p>And last, but not least, it could actually create <b>Peace on Earth and Goodwill Towards Men</b><i><b>, </b>thank you Kermit and Sneakers, I would never forget you. </i>&nbsp;Instead of increasing support and decreasing dissent relating to series of Unholy Wars that resulted from a false flag attack on U.S. soil.</p>
<p>If nothing else, I sincerely hope that I have convinced you, today, that Philip K. Dick was <i>inspired</i>&nbsp;by something outside himself &#8212; it should be obvious now.</p>
<p>In reality, what I really hope you take away from this is that something very big is being hidden from you, and its being used very improperly. &nbsp;Our species is at a crossroads, let&#8217;s not choose to be <i>slaves to cocaine, oil and secrecy</i>&nbsp;for eternity.</p>
<p>Maybe we should call it <b style="font-style:italic;">mind assistance,&nbsp;</b>and forget about all the silly control business<b style="font-style:italic;">.</b></p>
