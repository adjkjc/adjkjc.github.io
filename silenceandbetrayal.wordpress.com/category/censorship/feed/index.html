										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="tr_bq">Do you think your government is censoring the Internet?</div>
<p>In researching this article, I was searching for documentation relating to the Carnivore Project, and the resulting legal battle with the ACLU. &nbsp;Once upon a time, our society responded to such unconstitutional and treasonous privacy intrusions with a legal battle, or a temporary restraining order. &nbsp;The media covered these events once.</p>
<p>Check out the following:<br />&nbsp;<a href="http://www.accelerated-promotions.com/consumer-electronics/usa-patriot-act-carnivore.htm">http://www.accelerated-promotions.com/consumer-electronics/usa-patriot-act-carnivore.htm</a></p>
<p>And then be very, very sad that NBC has removed the <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/660096.asp?cp1=1">page that is linked to at the bottom</a> of the above. </p>
<p><b>Welcome to the Hidden American Empire. &nbsp;</b>Censorship of this type, in private sector media, at the obvious behest and benefit of the United States Government is <i style="font-weight:bold;">disgusting</i>, and you <b>should</b>&nbsp;care.</p>
<p>Do you? &nbsp;What&#8217;s really going on here:</p>
<p><a name='more'></a><br />The sad truth is that both Carnivore and Magic Lantern are part of a public disinformation campaign, one that is hiding a much more disturbing truth. &nbsp;That the United States, as well as international intelligence, has had the capability of modifying circuitry, including computer processors and neural circuitry, remotely for at least the last 50 years, using advanced physics, which they are also hiding from the general public.</p>
<p>From aclu.org (who by the way is <b>censoring</b>&nbsp;the fact that Carnivore was in operation prior to 9/11/2001:</p>
<blockquote><p>August 15, 2007&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Since 2002, telephone companies have been colluding in the president&#8217;s domestic spying program, wiretapping communications networks and voluntarily providing the NSA with millions of customers&#8217; calling records. This information has been turned over without customer knowledge or consent, and without any court order, warrant, or other proper legal process.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>In 2006,&nbsp;<a class="noline_blue" href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2006-05-10-nsa_x.htm" style="background-color:transparent;background-position:initial initial;background-repeat:initial initial;border:0;color:#225588;font-size:14px;margin:0;outline:0;padding:0;text-decoration:initial;vertical-align:baseline;" target="_blank"><i style="background-color:transparent;border:0;font-size:14px;margin:0;outline:0;padding:0;vertical-align:baseline;">USA Today</i>&nbsp;revealed</a>&nbsp;the telecoms’ participation in the illegal spying program. A number of lawsuits were filed against various telecom companies including the ACLU of Illinois lawsuit&nbsp;<i style="background-color:transparent;border:0;font-size:14px;margin:0;outline:0;padding:0;vertical-align:baseline;">Terkel v. AT&amp;T</i>, on behalf of the late author Studs Terkel and other Illinois citizens, and two lawsuits filed by the three California ACLU affiliates,&nbsp;<i style="background-color:transparent;border:0;font-size:14px;margin:0;outline:0;padding:0;vertical-align:baseline;">Campbell v. AT&amp;T</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i style="background-color:transparent;border:0;font-size:14px;margin:0;outline:0;padding:0;vertical-align:baseline;">Riordan v. Verizon</i>. These cases were all joined together with over 40 others and are now pending before U.S. District Court Judge Vaughn Walker in California.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The ACLU of Illinois has been named co-lead counsel in the consolidated cases.<br />But by the time the consolidated cases came to him, Walker had already ruled on one of those cases,&nbsp;<i style="background-color:transparent;border:0;font-size:14px;margin:0;outline:0;padding:0;vertical-align:baseline;">Hepting v. AT&amp;T</i>. Hepting is a class-action lawsuit brought by the&nbsp;<a class="noline_blue" href="http://www.eff.org/" style="background-color:transparent;background-position:initial initial;background-repeat:initial initial;border:0;color:#225588;font-size:14px;margin:0;outline:0;padding:0;text-decoration:initial;vertical-align:baseline;" target="_blank">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>&nbsp;that was filed soon after the&nbsp;<i style="background-color:transparent;border:0;font-size:14px;margin:0;outline:0;padding:0;vertical-align:baseline;">The New York Times</i>&nbsp;revealed the NSA’s warrantless surveillance program in December 2005. That lawsuit charges that the telecom giant violated customers&#8217; Fourth Amendment rights by giving the NSA unfettered access to its communications and customer data with a warrant. Walker ruled that government could not use the state secrets privilege to block the lawsuit.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The government appealed that decision, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit heard oral arguments in August 2007. But before the appeals court could deliver a decision on the appeal, Congress passed the FISA Amendments Act in July 2008, which essentially legalized the NSA&#8217;s wiretapping operation. Following the law&#8217;s signing, the appeals court declined to rule on&nbsp;<i style="background-color:transparent;border:0;font-size:14px;margin:0;outline:0;padding:0;vertical-align:baseline;">Hepting</i>&nbsp;and remanded the case back to district court.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>On December 2, 2008, the ACLU and EFF were back before Judge Walker arguing the unconstitutionality of the FISA Amendments Act. <b>A decision is pending.</b></p></blockquote>
<p>To summarize, in response to an illegal and unconstitutional operation being conducted by the National Security Agency and a multitude of private telecommunications providers, the United States Congress passed an unconstitutional law to &#8220;legalize&#8221; the program before a decision could be delivered by our &#8220;judicial system.&#8221; &nbsp;Just to fill you in, it is the job of the Judicial branch of our Federal government, and specifically the Supreme Court, to strike down unconstitutional laws.</p>
<p>In related news, the Supreme Court is still being <a href="http://aoc.gov/projects/supreme-court-west-fa%C3%A7ade-restoration">renovated</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;"><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size:medium;">In 1787, when the Framer&#8217;s of our great Constitution instituted Representative Democracy and our three branch government it was revolutionary, leaps and bounds ahead of contemporary nations, and the pinnacle of human government. The Constitution was meant to be a living document, to grow and change with our society and its advancement, to usher in a new world of self-rule where the voice of the people was the final word.</span></span></span></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;"><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size:medium;">Today, this same system is failing. Representative democracy has failed to evolve with our society and technological advancement, and now serves no purposes greater than to insulate the people from the process of governance.  It&#8217;s sprawling in<span lang="en-US">efficient bureaucracy has become the equivalent of Marx&#8217;s opiate of the masses, placating your desire for freedom and justice, and replacing it with the false impression of holding a voice that matters.  </span></span></span></span></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;"><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size:medium;"><span lang="en-US">In a time when your voice </span><span lang="en-US"><i>could, and should</i></span><span lang="en-US"><i><b></b></i></span><span lang="en-US">be heard, you are instead inundated with a news and media weapon which covers the machinations of election more than the will of the people.  Four years ago, Barrack Obama promised us </span><span lang="en-US"><i>change,</i></span><span lang="en-US">and change we did get.   Unfortunately the change we got was an increase in the destruction of Constitutional Liberties, an increase in spending without oversight, and an increase in conflict around the world.  These changes serve to benefit a small minority, one bent on perpetual war in order to falsely inflate our economy, and to steal valuable resources from innocent nations around the world. </span></span></span></span></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;"><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size:medium;"><span lang="en-US">These changes have taken your privacy from you, almost unilaterally, in your home, from your communications, and on the internet.  They have taken from you a media which once served the purpose of investigating government corruption and correcting wrongs in the world, to one which serves no purpose other than to rubber stamp governmental programs which would </span><span lang="en-US"><i>never</i></span><span lang="en-US"><i></i></span><span lang="en-US">have been allowed to exist twenty years ago.</span></span></span></span></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;"><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size:medium;"><span lang="en-US">The great advances in our technology have done nothing to increase your representation in government.  Instead of allowing you to vote for important legislation online, now your private emails and data will be opened to secretive organizations with no legislative oversight or mandate for existence.  Instead of opening government data and information to the people, you are given the FOIA, which is routinely ignored by all members of the Executive Branch – “openness in America” is nothing more than another drug used to silence your conscience.</span></span></span></span></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;"><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size:medium;"><span lang="en-US">Democracy is failing, not because it&#8217;s a bad idea, but because the people in charge of </span></span></span></span><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size:medium;"><span lang="en-US"><i>changing</i></span></span></span></span><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size:medium;"><span lang="en-US">and </span></span></span></span><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size:medium;"><span lang="en-US"><i>evolving it </i></span></span></span></span><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size:medium;"><span lang="en-US">have had their power taken from them.  The United States Congress has been systematically having its legislative power removed from it by the Office of the President of the United States of America since 2001, in plain view.  The treasonous acts of George W. Bush&#8217;s broad sweeping overuse of the Executive Order in order to legislate has not been checked by the removal of a neo-conservative from office, rather it has been perpetuated and made worse.  This abuse destroys the protections afforded by the Constitution, and removes your voice from governance further. &nbsp;It is the sole purpose of the legislative branch to create law, the laws the People need and desire. &nbsp;</span></span></span></span></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;"><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size:medium;"><span lang="en-US">To the Congress of the United States, to The People, and to the Media:</span></span></span></span></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;"><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size:medium;"><span lang="en-US">Why have you ignored your loss of Liberty?</span></span></span></span></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;"></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="text-align:justify;">Nobody is mind controlling </span><i style="text-align:justify;">me</i><span style="text-align:justify;">.</span></p>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;"><i>The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn&#8217;t exist.</i></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;">-The Usual Suspects</div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;">In 1971, William Colby testified before the Church Committee, and effectively had the CIA&#8217;s dabble into forced covert LSD administration and mind control testing<b><i>effectively shutdown</i>.</b>  This would be the first and last public disclosure by a Central Intelligence Agency Director relating to a scientific attempt to modify and read the inner thoughts of human beings, the &#8216;gist&#8217; of the disclosure was that they were using narcotics, electroshock, and EEG&#8217;s in a program which was popularly believed to be working towards the creation of a &#8220;Manchurian Candidate.&#8221; &nbsp;This is the popular image of mind control, that one&#8217;s faculties would be completely taken over, and given some audible or subconscious trigger code, would cause them to <i>mindlessly commit some crime</i>.. like assassinating a public figure at a speaking engagement. &nbsp;This perception is stupid.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;">While the ability to “remotely control” a human being is without doubt within the capabilities of intelligence organizations such as the Central Intelligence Agency, MI-6, and the former KGB, remote neural stimulation <i>could also be </i>much more subtle.  It could be used to make you ignore, or not care about something that you would otherwise find important, like <i>democracy,&nbsp;privacy,</i> and <i>freedom of speech</i>.  It could make you believe that something you read which you would otherwise find <i>intelligent and thought provoking</i>is..&nbsp;<i>off the wall</i>.  Mind control could be used to make you forgive a person or an organization, maybe your <i>government</i>for something that you probably shouldn&#8217;t forgive them for.  It is possible that it would be so subtle that you would never, ever know it was happening to you.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;"><a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2012/11/forbidden-knowledge-quantum-charge.html">Remote neural control</a> of the human brain would also give these organizations the ability to fully control the autonomic nervous system – they could cause people to suffocate, <b>have heart attacks</b>, or neurological disorders like Schizophrenia, Parkinson&#8217;s disease, and <b>Alzheimer&#8217;s</b>&#8230; its even possible that this could be done to <i>an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan" target="_blank">American President</a>.</i>  There are a number of writers and scientists “on the trail of the Octopus” who have suffered from untimely deaths due to heart attacks, notably:<a href="http://www.rumormillnews.com/cgi-bin/archive.cgi?read=20193" target="_blank">Jim Keith,</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/biomedical-targeted-individual-dies-suddenly" target="_blank">Sean Stinn</a>, and <a href="http://www.duncanlaurie.com/artists/john-norseen-passes-sept-27" target="_blank">John Norseen</a>. &nbsp;Before his death, John Norseen had been talking about Lockheed&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://www.duncanlaurie.com/writing/outlaw_technology/10_twin_photons_biological_steganography" target="_blank">mind</a> <a href="http://www.duncanlaurie.com/writing/outlaw_technology/03_krylov_space" target="_blank">control</a>&#8221; <a href="http://www.duncanlaurie.com/writing/outlaw_technology/15_semiotics_and_the_flow_of_capital" target="_blank">abilities</a>. &nbsp;He was a senior engineer and scientist working for that company on a government project called <a href="http://www.usnews.com/usnews/culture/articles/000103/archive_033992.htm" target="_blank">&#8216;bio-fusion.</a>&#8216;</div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;">It <i>might also</i> be able to induce suicidal tendencies, and there are several writers and scientists that slit their wrists, and jumped from tall buildings: <a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/last_circle/0.htm" target="_blank">Danny Casolaro</a>, David Kelly,  and Frank Olson.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;">Mind control <i>may also</i> be able to induce in the minds of Senators like Diane Feinstein, Saxby Chambliss, and Bill Nelson, <i>who <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/10/AR2007011001399.html" target="_blank">might know</a> about the existence and capability of the technology</i>, that it is only being used for <i>legitimate</i>intelligence gathering purposes, and <i>not against the population of the United States of America, or themselves. </i>It could make otherwise good and patriotic representatives ignore programs which completely disregard American values and the protections of the Constitution of the United States of America – like the Patriot Act, and the <a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2012/11/the-carnivore-conspiracy.html">Carnivore Operation</a>. &nbsp;It <i>might also</i>&nbsp;make them and you not care that these programs were in place before 9/11, and that tragedy being used to justify their existence makes.. no sense&#8230; <i>temporally</i> speaking.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;">Going back a few years, mind control <i>might</i>be the reason that <a href="http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB2/nsaebb2.htm" target="_blank">clear and documented</a> links between the Central Intelligence Agency, top officials, and international <i>cocaine</i>trafficking went completely non prosecuted in the wake of Iran Contra.. it <i>might</i> be the reason that the American public didn&#8217;t care that in the following years, neither the sitting president nor his opponent mentioned the affair – at all in the next election.   </div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;">It <i>might also</i> be the reason that the American Public, its elected representatives and a Congressional Investigation failed to understand the grave implications of <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2012/09/sleeping-with-the-devil-how-u-s-and-saudi-backing-of-al-qaeda-led-to-911.html" target="_blank">obvious</a> and <a href="http://rense.com/general14/bushsformer.htm" target="_blank">documented</a> <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2012/09/911-3000-americans-for-3-saudi-princes/" target="_blank">financial</a>, <a href="http://www.fromthewilderness.com/free/ww3/09_18_01_bushbin.html" target="_blank">social</a>, and <a href="http://www.konformist.com/2005/911-flight-school.htm" target="_blank">operational links</a> between notorious domestic terrorists and two American President&#8217;s and their employer.  It <i>might</i>be the reason that the public does not understand how damning the evidence is, relegating it to “fringe conspiracy theories.”  The actions of the Office of the President on the morning of 9/11 showed <a href="http://www.historycommons.org/timeline.jsp?day_of_9/11=dickcheney&amp;timeline=complete_911_timeline" target="_blank">clear <i>foreknowledge</i></a> of the attack, the terrorists were linked financially to the Bush family who had just met with a top Islamic financier, the airfield which trained the suicide pilots is directly linked to the Central Intelligence Agency.  Hundreds of investors made <a href="http://www.historycommons.org/timeline.jsp?day_of_9/11=dickcheney&amp;timeline=complete_911_timeline" target="_blank">obvious andprofitable short sales</a> against the airlines, insurers, and occupants of the World Trade Center in the days before the attack.  Mind control <i>may also explain</i>why nobody realizes that both Bush President&#8217;s started wars in Iraq in order to <i>steal</i> oil, and artificially inflate its price.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;">I&#8217;m <i>not even going to mention </i>the fact that the Intelligence arm of USA has the ability to <b>remotely control electronics</b>, and could have landed the planes peacefully themselves.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;">Several large and well known Congressional investigations were probably <i>effectively shut down</i>because of the use of mind control, notably: Church, Tower, Warren, Rockefeller, and the 9/11 Commissions.  Please open your eyes, freedom and democracy have been hanging in the balance for the last half century, and they are <i>losing.</i></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;"><i>Effectively shut down</i>, by the way is intelligence parlance for transferring a program to defense contractors and/or organized crime&#8230; <i>just ask Stan Lee.</i></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;"><i>I think I&#8217;m a funny person.</i> But I also realize that without inflection and personal presentation it is sometimes difficult to convey humor on a medium such as the Internet.  So to be more clear I have <i>italicized</i>what I intend to be intentional humor in this post.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;"><i>Mind control might explain how </i><a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2012/11/the-failure-of-representative-democracy.html"><b><i>1984</i>&nbsp;</b>came and went</a> and nobody thought it had come true.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;">Or.. <i>we might just all be morons</i> that don&#8217;t care about freedom, <i>truth</i>, and justice. </p>
<p>The worst of it, &nbsp;we could all be doing <a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2012/12/what-can-mind-control-do-for-me.html">so much better</a>.</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="text-align:justify;">There is a ridiculous and global disinformation campaign being perpetrated against the scientific community particularly, and the world in general, relating to quantum entanglement. &nbsp;The properties of quantum entanglement have been fully known by the American Government, as well as many other nations, including the United Kingdom, the former USSR, and Israel since shortly after World War II, at the very latest. &nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Albert Einstein participated in a US government sponsored disinformation operation by debunking the <a href="http://gradworks.umi.com/33/69/3369373.html">theory of Theodore Kaluza</a>, which united his equations with Maxwell&#8217;s electromagnetism via the introduction of a fifth dimension. &nbsp;Kaluza&#8217;s solution was a beautiful piece of mathematics, creating a logical and simple explanation for &#8216;spooky action at a distance.&#8217; &nbsp;Since that time, global physics discovery, outside of government research, has been thrown severely off track, causing ridiculous theories including upwards of 11 extra dimensions with no way to verify them. &nbsp;While some may consider him an &#8220;American hero&#8221; for his work on the Manhattan Project, I believe he did his country and the whole of humanity a great disservice by participating in what seems to be a vast inter-governmental conspiracy to conceal the truth that quantum entanglement conveys classical information.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><b>By entangling to molecules inherent in the structure of neuronal voltage gated ion channels, it is possible to both <i>suppress</i> and <i>activate</i> action potentials by conveying charge, via entanglement. &nbsp;These gates can be manipulated, using the brain&#8217;s endogenous ions in order to manipulate thoughts, feelings, desires. &nbsp;It is also<i> possible to fully control </i>and augment the visual, auditory, and motor cortex functions.&nbsp;</b></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><b><br /></b></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">In addition to &#8220;remote control&#8221; of human brains, it should be obvious that the same technology can be used to remotely monitor and manipulate practically any electronic device. &nbsp;This type of attack, similar to two way <i>Van Eck Phreaking</i>, and leading to the chosen name, allows for the currently existing <b>global surveillance infrastructure</b>, which is being hidden from you by silly &#8220;front&#8221; programs like Carnivore, Total Information Awareness, and Echelon. &nbsp;The purpose of these smoke screens is to insulate the population from the reality that this infrastructure has been in place for much longer than you would thing, and that the governments of the world are fully capable of remotely reading and writing data on your cell phone, your computer, and your head; 24/7 completely unfettered by conventional electromagnetic shielding or any type of known countermeasure.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><b><br /></b></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><b><a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1203.0896v2.pdf">Quantum</a> <a href="http://gradworks.umi.com/33/69/3369373.html">Charge</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Eck_phreaking">Phreaking</a>&nbsp;may very well be the phenomenon responsible for the religious &#8220;myths&#8221; of demonic possession, divine inspiration, and the &#8220;possession&#8221; of the Holy Spirit described in Acts of the Apostles. &nbsp;If this is the case it is most certainly the result of xeno-intervention in our history, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/2021-Times-Battle-between-Machine/dp/1480169994/" target="_blank">The End Times</a>&nbsp;details a history of cultural &#8220;proof&#8221; of the phenomenon in the context of historical religion and scientific discovery.</b></div>
