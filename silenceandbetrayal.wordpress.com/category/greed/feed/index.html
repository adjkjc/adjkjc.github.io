										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Fake Depression of 2008: the greatest wealth transfer in the history of humanity #MOFK Full #disclosure.</p>
<p>This transfer was perpetrated by global governments, in order to steal private institutions, financial instruments, and property from the people. &nbsp;It is the single largest nationalization of private industry in history, and it is hidden from your view. &nbsp;These governments have access to a time machine, and knew the outcome in advance. &nbsp;The Fed, Greenspan, Michael Milkmen the US and its Organized Crime allies, created the problem with poor fiscal policy and toxic CDO&#8217;s &#8212; inflating the bubble with malintent. &nbsp;In addition, after the false collapse, they corrupted world financial markets, manipulating the price of crude oil, the US Dollar, as well as global equity and debt markets. </p>
<p>Nostradamus wrote about it in <i>Les Propheties C10:Q20:</i></p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq"><p><span style="background-color:white;font-family:Verdana;font-size:13px;">Tous les amis qu&#8217;auront tenu party,&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color:white;font-family:Verdana;font-size:13px;">Pour rude en lettres mis mort &amp; saccagé.&nbsp;</span><span style="background-color:white;font-family:Verdana;font-size:13px;">Biens publiez par fixe grand neanty,</span><span style="background-color:white;font-family:Verdana;font-size:13px;">Onc Romain peuple ne fut tant outragé.</span>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p></p>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;"><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size:medium;">In 1787, when the Framer&#8217;s of our great Constitution instituted Representative Democracy and our three branch government it was revolutionary, leaps and bounds ahead of contemporary nations, and the pinnacle of human government. The Constitution was meant to be a living document, to grow and change with our society and its advancement, to usher in a new world of self-rule where the voice of the people was the final word.</span></span></span></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;"><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size:medium;">Today, this same system is failing. Representative democracy has failed to evolve with our society and technological advancement, and now serves no purposes greater than to insulate the people from the process of governance.  It&#8217;s sprawling in<span lang="en-US">efficient bureaucracy has become the equivalent of Marx&#8217;s opiate of the masses, placating your desire for freedom and justice, and replacing it with the false impression of holding a voice that matters.  </span></span></span></span></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;"><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size:medium;"><span lang="en-US">In a time when your voice </span><span lang="en-US"><i>could, and should</i></span><span lang="en-US"><i><b></b></i></span><span lang="en-US">be heard, you are instead inundated with a news and media weapon which covers the machinations of election more than the will of the people.  Four years ago, Barrack Obama promised us </span><span lang="en-US"><i>change,</i></span><span lang="en-US">and change we did get.   Unfortunately the change we got was an increase in the destruction of Constitutional Liberties, an increase in spending without oversight, and an increase in conflict around the world.  These changes serve to benefit a small minority, one bent on perpetual war in order to falsely inflate our economy, and to steal valuable resources from innocent nations around the world. </span></span></span></span></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;"><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size:medium;"><span lang="en-US">These changes have taken your privacy from you, almost unilaterally, in your home, from your communications, and on the internet.  They have taken from you a media which once served the purpose of investigating government corruption and correcting wrongs in the world, to one which serves no purpose other than to rubber stamp governmental programs which would </span><span lang="en-US"><i>never</i></span><span lang="en-US"><i></i></span><span lang="en-US">have been allowed to exist twenty years ago.</span></span></span></span></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;"><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size:medium;"><span lang="en-US">The great advances in our technology have done nothing to increase your representation in government.  Instead of allowing you to vote for important legislation online, now your private emails and data will be opened to secretive organizations with no legislative oversight or mandate for existence.  Instead of opening government data and information to the people, you are given the FOIA, which is routinely ignored by all members of the Executive Branch – “openness in America” is nothing more than another drug used to silence your conscience.</span></span></span></span></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;"><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size:medium;"><span lang="en-US">Democracy is failing, not because it&#8217;s a bad idea, but because the people in charge of </span></span></span></span><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size:medium;"><span lang="en-US"><i>changing</i></span></span></span></span><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size:medium;"><span lang="en-US">and </span></span></span></span><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size:medium;"><span lang="en-US"><i>evolving it </i></span></span></span></span><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size:medium;"><span lang="en-US">have had their power taken from them.  The United States Congress has been systematically having its legislative power removed from it by the Office of the President of the United States of America since 2001, in plain view.  The treasonous acts of George W. Bush&#8217;s broad sweeping overuse of the Executive Order in order to legislate has not been checked by the removal of a neo-conservative from office, rather it has been perpetuated and made worse.  This abuse destroys the protections afforded by the Constitution, and removes your voice from governance further. &nbsp;It is the sole purpose of the legislative branch to create law, the laws the People need and desire. &nbsp;</span></span></span></span></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;"><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size:medium;"><span lang="en-US">To the Congress of the United States, to The People, and to the Media:</span></span></span></span></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;"><span style="color:black;"><span style="font-family:Times New Roman;"><span style="font-size:medium;"><span lang="en-US">Why have you ignored your loss of Liberty?</span></span></span></span></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;">Do you <a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2012/10/how-stupid-are-you.html">even</a> <a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2012/11/nobody-is-mind-controlling-me.html">know</a>?</div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="text-align:justify;">Nobody is mind controlling </span><i style="text-align:justify;">me</i><span style="text-align:justify;">.</span></p>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;"><i>The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn&#8217;t exist.</i></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;">-The Usual Suspects</div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;">In 1971, William Colby testified before the Church Committee, and effectively had the CIA&#8217;s dabble into forced covert LSD administration and mind control testing<b><i>effectively shutdown</i>.</b>  This would be the first and last public disclosure by a Central Intelligence Agency Director relating to a scientific attempt to modify and read the inner thoughts of human beings, the &#8216;gist&#8217; of the disclosure was that they were using narcotics, electroshock, and EEG&#8217;s in a program which was popularly believed to be working towards the creation of a &#8220;Manchurian Candidate.&#8221; &nbsp;This is the popular image of mind control, that one&#8217;s faculties would be completely taken over, and given some audible or subconscious trigger code, would cause them to <i>mindlessly commit some crime</i>.. like assassinating a public figure at a speaking engagement. &nbsp;This perception is stupid.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;">While the ability to “remotely control” a human being is without doubt within the capabilities of intelligence organizations such as the Central Intelligence Agency, MI-6, and the former KGB, remote neural stimulation <i>could also be </i>much more subtle.  It could be used to make you ignore, or not care about something that you would otherwise find important, like <i>democracy,&nbsp;privacy,</i> and <i>freedom of speech</i>.  It could make you believe that something you read which you would otherwise find <i>intelligent and thought provoking</i>is..&nbsp;<i>off the wall</i>.  Mind control could be used to make you forgive a person or an organization, maybe your <i>government</i>for something that you probably shouldn&#8217;t forgive them for.  It is possible that it would be so subtle that you would never, ever know it was happening to you.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;"><a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2012/11/forbidden-knowledge-quantum-charge.html">Remote neural control</a> of the human brain would also give these organizations the ability to fully control the autonomic nervous system – they could cause people to suffocate, <b>have heart attacks</b>, or neurological disorders like Schizophrenia, Parkinson&#8217;s disease, and <b>Alzheimer&#8217;s</b>&#8230; its even possible that this could be done to <i>an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan" target="_blank">American President</a>.</i>  There are a number of writers and scientists “on the trail of the Octopus” who have suffered from untimely deaths due to heart attacks, notably:<a href="http://www.rumormillnews.com/cgi-bin/archive.cgi?read=20193" target="_blank">Jim Keith,</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/biomedical-targeted-individual-dies-suddenly" target="_blank">Sean Stinn</a>, and <a href="http://www.duncanlaurie.com/artists/john-norseen-passes-sept-27" target="_blank">John Norseen</a>. &nbsp;Before his death, John Norseen had been talking about Lockheed&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://www.duncanlaurie.com/writing/outlaw_technology/10_twin_photons_biological_steganography" target="_blank">mind</a> <a href="http://www.duncanlaurie.com/writing/outlaw_technology/03_krylov_space" target="_blank">control</a>&#8221; <a href="http://www.duncanlaurie.com/writing/outlaw_technology/15_semiotics_and_the_flow_of_capital" target="_blank">abilities</a>. &nbsp;He was a senior engineer and scientist working for that company on a government project called <a href="http://www.usnews.com/usnews/culture/articles/000103/archive_033992.htm" target="_blank">&#8216;bio-fusion.</a>&#8216;</div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;">It <i>might also</i> be able to induce suicidal tendencies, and there are several writers and scientists that slit their wrists, and jumped from tall buildings: <a href="http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/sociopolitica/last_circle/0.htm" target="_blank">Danny Casolaro</a>, David Kelly,  and Frank Olson.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;">Mind control <i>may also</i> be able to induce in the minds of Senators like Diane Feinstein, Saxby Chambliss, and Bill Nelson, <i>who <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/10/AR2007011001399.html" target="_blank">might know</a> about the existence and capability of the technology</i>, that it is only being used for <i>legitimate</i>intelligence gathering purposes, and <i>not against the population of the United States of America, or themselves. </i>It could make otherwise good and patriotic representatives ignore programs which completely disregard American values and the protections of the Constitution of the United States of America – like the Patriot Act, and the <a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2012/11/the-carnivore-conspiracy.html">Carnivore Operation</a>. &nbsp;It <i>might also</i>&nbsp;make them and you not care that these programs were in place before 9/11, and that tragedy being used to justify their existence makes.. no sense&#8230; <i>temporally</i> speaking.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;">Going back a few years, mind control <i>might</i>be the reason that <a href="http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB2/nsaebb2.htm" target="_blank">clear and documented</a> links between the Central Intelligence Agency, top officials, and international <i>cocaine</i>trafficking went completely non prosecuted in the wake of Iran Contra.. it <i>might</i> be the reason that the American public didn&#8217;t care that in the following years, neither the sitting president nor his opponent mentioned the affair – at all in the next election.   </div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;">It <i>might also</i> be the reason that the American Public, its elected representatives and a Congressional Investigation failed to understand the grave implications of <a href="http://www.washingtonsblog.com/2012/09/sleeping-with-the-devil-how-u-s-and-saudi-backing-of-al-qaeda-led-to-911.html" target="_blank">obvious</a> and <a href="http://rense.com/general14/bushsformer.htm" target="_blank">documented</a> <a href="http://www.wnd.com/2012/09/911-3000-americans-for-3-saudi-princes/" target="_blank">financial</a>, <a href="http://www.fromthewilderness.com/free/ww3/09_18_01_bushbin.html" target="_blank">social</a>, and <a href="http://www.konformist.com/2005/911-flight-school.htm" target="_blank">operational links</a> between notorious domestic terrorists and two American President&#8217;s and their employer.  It <i>might</i>be the reason that the public does not understand how damning the evidence is, relegating it to “fringe conspiracy theories.”  The actions of the Office of the President on the morning of 9/11 showed <a href="http://www.historycommons.org/timeline.jsp?day_of_9/11=dickcheney&amp;timeline=complete_911_timeline" target="_blank">clear <i>foreknowledge</i></a> of the attack, the terrorists were linked financially to the Bush family who had just met with a top Islamic financier, the airfield which trained the suicide pilots is directly linked to the Central Intelligence Agency.  Hundreds of investors made <a href="http://www.historycommons.org/timeline.jsp?day_of_9/11=dickcheney&amp;timeline=complete_911_timeline" target="_blank">obvious andprofitable short sales</a> against the airlines, insurers, and occupants of the World Trade Center in the days before the attack.  Mind control <i>may also explain</i>why nobody realizes that both Bush President&#8217;s started wars in Iraq in order to <i>steal</i> oil, and artificially inflate its price.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;">I&#8217;m <i>not even going to mention </i>the fact that the Intelligence arm of USA has the ability to <b>remotely control electronics</b>, and could have landed the planes peacefully themselves.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;">Several large and well known Congressional investigations were probably <i>effectively shut down</i>because of the use of mind control, notably: Church, Tower, Warren, Rockefeller, and the 9/11 Commissions.  Please open your eyes, freedom and democracy have been hanging in the balance for the last half century, and they are <i>losing.</i></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;"><i>Effectively shut down</i>, by the way is intelligence parlance for transferring a program to defense contractors and/or organized crime&#8230; <i>just ask Stan Lee.</i></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;"><i>I think I&#8217;m a funny person.</i> But I also realize that without inflection and personal presentation it is sometimes difficult to convey humor on a medium such as the Internet.  So to be more clear I have <i>italicized</i>what I intend to be intentional humor in this post.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;"><i>Mind control might explain how </i><a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2012/11/the-failure-of-representative-democracy.html"><b><i>1984</i>&nbsp;</b>came and went</a> and nobody thought it had come true.</div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="margin-bottom:0;text-align:justify;">Or.. <i>we might just all be morons</i> that don&#8217;t care about freedom, <i>truth</i>, and justice. </p>
<p>The worst of it, &nbsp;we could all be doing <a href="http://unduecoercion.blogspot.com/2012/12/what-can-mind-control-do-for-me.html">so much better</a>.</div>
