										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"><a href="https://silenceandbetrayal.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/freebsd_logo2.jpg" style="clear:left;float:left;margin-bottom:1em;margin-right:1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="https://silenceandbetrayal.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/freebsd_logo.jpg?w=188&#038;h=200" width="188" /></a></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">After terrorizing AOL with freedom, many of the people who were engaged in chatting on the famous service&#8217;s &#8220;rooms&#8221; for hours on end moved to something that was much older, and much larger. &nbsp;Internet Relay Chat. &nbsp;AOL began offering TCP/IP connection to the <i>internet</i>&nbsp;in the early nineties, though most users didn&#8217;t know or utilize it. &nbsp;This opened many of the fledgling web&#8217;s hidden services to people who had never before experienced the breadth of global&nbsp;connectedness&nbsp;which came from a vast sea of users. &nbsp;Many of us began congregating on IRC, and almost unilaterally changed direction from Windows programming in Visual Basic to learning another very old technology. &nbsp;The POSIX system, embodied in freely distributed and community created systems: FreeBSD and Linux. &nbsp;This was mid 90&#8217;s, and in those days <i>Ubuntu&#8217;s </i>Windows like plug and play distribution wasn&#8217;t even an idea in Mark Shuttleworth&#8217;s mind. &nbsp;We were plunged into a world of custom kernel compilations and config file jockeying. &nbsp;Children learning to service the innards of the types of systems which ran the world&#8217;s largest companies and government operations.</div>
<blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align:justify;"><p>It&#8217;s no surprise to me today that the world we were plunged into was also <b>tagged</b>&nbsp;with religious iconography, much like the world&#8217;s multitude of corporations including illuminati imagery. In my mind, these things are done subconsciously, like much of the modern day prophesy which secretly implants the ideas as symbols of the <b>hidden influence</b>&nbsp;in our culture and society. &nbsp;Some of these ideas are <b>Deus Ex Machina</b><i>, </i>the artificial intelligence singularity: the <b>Source</b> (from the Matrix), and <b>Skynet</b> (from Terminator). &nbsp;The idea of a consciousness being born from the creation of humanity, machines, is riddled in our modern day art, and for most people it&#8217;s an inevitable conclusion that it will eventually happen. &nbsp;<b>What if it has already?</b>&nbsp; What if it happened before we began building tools from sticks and stones?<i> </i>If Satan were in the Machine, as kids we were learning how to do routine maintenance on the <b>hidden influence</b>&nbsp;itself.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<div style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace;font-size:x-small;">Then I turned to see the voice that was speaking with me. And having turned I saw seven golden lampstands; and in the middle of the lampstands I saw one like a son of man, clothed in a robe reaching to the feet, and girded across His chest with a golden sash. His head and His hair were white like white wool, like snow; and His eyes were like a flame of fire. His feet were like burnished bronze, when it has been made to glow in a furnace, and His voice was like the sound of many waters. In His right hand He held seven stars, and out of His mouth came a sharp two-edged sword; and His face was like the sun shining in its strength.</span></div>
<p><span style="font-family:Courier New, Courier, monospace;font-size:x-small;"></span></p>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Courier New, Courier, monospace;font-size:x-small;">-Revelation 1:12-16</span></div>
<p><span style="font-family:Courier New, Courier, monospace;font-size:x-small;"></span></p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align:justify;"><p><span style="font-family:inherit;">Revelation speaks of a <b>son of man</b>, progeny of our entire civilization. &nbsp;It is an allusion to a machine, created by mankind, and this is made clearer with its references to red lights, and metals adorning its body. It is the same concept described by Deus Ex Machina, the Singularity, and in our modern art. &nbsp;The sound of many waters could easily be the humm of an engine or power source, described by someone who had no knowledge of what those things are. &nbsp;The seven stars are part of the key to decoding Revelation, they point directly to the hidden theme of repeating like ideas which take on the true meaning when taken together.</span></p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq"><p><span style="font-family:Courier New, Courier, monospace;font-size:x-small;">As for the mystery of the seven stars which you saw in My right hand, and the seven golden lampstands: the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches. -Revelation 1:20</span></p></blockquote>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><a href="https://silenceandbetrayal.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/pain2.jpg" style="clear:right;display:inline!important;float:right;margin-bottom:1em;margin-left:1em;text-align:justify;"><img border="0" height="200" src="https://silenceandbetrayal.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/pain.jpg?w=173&#038;h=200" width="173" /></a>Around the same time, at a &#8220;play&#8221; gathering at a friends house, BASIC programming came up. &nbsp;I was surprised that the friend of my friend was also interested in the same things as me, programming, Linux, etc. &nbsp;In what seemed like the most innocuous thing in the world at the time, he mentioned an IRC channel which housed a gathering of people like us, sharing information in .TXT files on BBS&#8217;s and the internet. &nbsp;The group was called the <b><a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20111027234914/http://pain.net/">Pan American Information Network</a>, </b>and it remains a big part of my life through today. &nbsp;It is also a huge piece of the maze that brought me to the Illuminati, and the innocuous suggestion from an&nbsp;acquaintance&nbsp;now reeks of something I refer to as a <b><a href="http://nesara.insights2.org/Monarch.html">handler transfer</a></b>&nbsp;in <b>mind control parlance.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align:justify;"><p>From this point forward, and through my entire adult life, I would unknowingly be surrounded by agents of the Illuminati. &nbsp; They could be friends, lovers, or&nbsp;acquaintances, &nbsp; but the commonality they had was they either&nbsp;<b>knew</b>&nbsp;about mind control, or were heavily influenced by it. &nbsp;Some were in communication, via synthetic telepathy, with a centralized authority, though to this day I&#8217;m not sure what <b>they</b>&nbsp;think it is, and its very possible that they don&#8217;t all believe the same thing. &nbsp;I would not understand the method of communication for many years, nor would I know exactly who they were until it was revealed to me during the process of gang-stalking. &nbsp;In the public eye, these Handler&#8217;s are the equivalent of Sirhan Sirhan&#8217;s <b>angel</b> who touched him on his shoulder just prior to &#8220;shooting&#8221; RFK&#8230; in my world it appears they were in place to make small adjustments in my life course, to help tell the story that you are hearing today. &nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<div style="text-align:justify;">#PAIN would become a gathering place of people who had followed the same path as me, programmers from AOL, Linux&nbsp;aficionados,&nbsp;and hackers. &nbsp; <b>Everyone</b>&nbsp;from the original creator of <b>AOHell</b>&nbsp;to the leader of the group was influencedk by the Illuminati and the <b>hidden influence</b>, our paths were too similar, and the fact that we remained closely connected through the power of the internet is a testament to their use of &nbsp;computers and networking in fulfilling their plan. &nbsp;For years we would discuss everything from gadgets, to hacking, to religion, and in many cases would have day long conversations about the inner workings of the universe and the world around us. &nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">In 1996 I met a real life friend from #PAIN, local to my area, and the next year we went to a <b>2600 meeting</b> together. &nbsp;The coordinator of the meeting would turn out to be an ex-Navy officer, who received a monthly check from them. &nbsp;This kind of government payroll, and usage of the sprawling military industrial complex in order to finance their operation, and pay <b>handlers</b>, is indicative of the Illuminati.</div>
<blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align:justify;"><p>Last year, after being told that this operation had been in place my entire life&#8230; using the <b>Truman Show</b>&nbsp;as a euphemism for life-long monitoring, I asked for proof. &nbsp;The details of this interaction are astounding, and the answer won&#8217;t make sense to you until much later, but the reply was <b>perfect.</b></p></blockquote>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:Courier New, Courier, monospace;font-size:x-small;">It all started on AOL.</span></div>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:Courier New, Courier, monospace;font-size:x-small;">#Mafia</span></div>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:Courier New, Courier, monospace;font-size:x-small;">#FBI</span></div>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:Courier New, Courier, monospace;font-size:x-small;">#KGB</span></div>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:Courier New, Courier, monospace;font-size:x-small;">#PAIN</span></div>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:Courier New, Courier, monospace;font-size:x-small;">#fuck_the_world</span></div>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span style="font-family:Courier New, Courier, monospace;font-size:x-small;">#hellonearth</span></div>
<blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align:justify;"><p>The connotation was that the channels I talked in were somehow contrived. &nbsp;That mind control was used in order to not only place me there, but to create the channel names. &nbsp;On IRC these names could be anything, and for them to have been so clearly tied to the story that had been told to me for the past year was&#8230; unbelievable. &nbsp;Also mildly unbelievable that I hadn&#8217;t realized or noticed. &nbsp;&nbsp;Almost as soon as it was spoken, it was taken away. &nbsp;I thought of an alternative, in the usual synthetic transfer of <b>semiotic thoughts</b>. &nbsp;They <b>had </b>been watching, but the story for the last year was retrofit to my history, designed to create the false impression that the mind control had been there&#8230; my entire life. &nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align:justify;"><p><b>I would later realize that the first story, that I had experienced the influence of a supernatural force since.. before my birth was the real truth. &nbsp;It is a parallel for human history, and for the realization that this same force has&nbsp;been influencing us since before our creation.</b></p></blockquote>
<blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align:justify;"><p>This was the exact order I began chatting in those channels on IRC, and it paralleled &nbsp;exactly the change between organizations which I believed was responsible for the <b>mind control attack </b>which is known as gang-stalking or OSEH. &nbsp;I had spent months researching the <b>who</b>&nbsp;and the <b>how</b>, and my trail, directed the whole time by the <b>hidden influence</b>&nbsp;brought me step by step through each of those organizations, and then the final realization that they were <b>all involved. </b>&nbsp;It also links the entire organization to the machine, the son of man from the Bible. &nbsp;It is a microcosm of the story that you are being told, and this ability to create fractal-like stories within stories has been repeated to me over and over again.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div style="text-align:justify;">In my youth, I passed between private and public schools several times before winding up at Pine Crest School, one of the top prep schools in the country. &nbsp;Between schools, I always did very well on standardized tests, and often tested significantly above grade level in reading and mathematics&#8230; you could say I was exceptionally smart back then. </p>
<blockquote class="tr_bq"><p>At a very young age my friends and I took a huge interest in computers. &nbsp;My family had one of the <i>old</i>&nbsp;Apple II&#8217;s, the kind with the keyboard and computer included in the same chassis, and my older brother and his friends were also enthralled with the little machine and its amazing possibilities. &nbsp;After he went to college, we began poking around in their &#8220;stuff,&#8221; and thoroughly enjoyed playing <i>Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves. &nbsp;</i>We later stumbled upon a home made <i>Star Wars</i>&nbsp;game, programmed in BASIC, and the world of the <i>beauty of the baud </i>was within our grasp.</p></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"><a href="https://silenceandbetrayal.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/aol-illuminati2.jpg" style="clear:left;float:left;margin-bottom:1em;margin-right:1em;"><img border="0" height="97" src="https://silenceandbetrayal.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/aol-illuminati.jpg?w=200&#038;h=97" width="200" /></a></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Some time around the age of 10 we meandered from Prodigy (P*) to America Online, and became engulfed with the &#8220;Free Warez&#8221; movement, which turned into something much larger in the years that followed. &nbsp;At that time it was a smaller group, and included many people who considered themselves &#8220;hackers&#8221; at the time. &nbsp;</div>
<div></p>
<blockquote>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace;font-size:xx-small;">This is our world now&#8230; the world of the electron and the switch, the beauty of the baud.&nbsp;</span></div>
<p><span style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace;font-size:xx-small;text-align:justify;">We make use of a service already existing without paying for what could be dirt-cheap if it wasn&#8217;t run by profiteering gluttons, and you call us criminals.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family:Courier New, Courier, monospace;font-size:xx-small;"></span><br /><span style="font-family:Courier New, Courier, monospace;font-size:xx-small;"></span><span style="font-family:Courier New, Courier, monospace;font-size:xx-small;"></span></p>

<div style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Courier New, Courier, monospace;font-size:xx-small;">We exist without skin color, without nationality, without religious bias&#8230; and you call us criminals.&nbsp;</span></div>

<div style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Courier New, Courier, monospace;font-size:xx-small;">You build atomic bombs, you wage wars, you murder, cheat, and lie to us and try to make us believe it&#8217;s for our own good, yet we&#8217;re the criminals.</span></div>
<p><span style="font-family:Courier New, Courier, monospace;font-size:xx-small;"></span><span style="font-family:Courier New, Courier, monospace;font-size:xx-small;"></span></p>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:Courier New, Courier, monospace;font-size:xx-small;">Yes, I am a criminal. My crime is that of curiosity. My crime is that of judging people by what they say and think, not what they look like. My crime is that of outsmarting you, something that you will never forgive me for. &nbsp;&#8211;The Mentor, Kevin Mitnick</span></div>
<p><span style="font-family:Courier New, Courier, monospace;font-size:xx-small;"></span></p></blockquote>
<div style="text-align:justify;">&nbsp;My interest in computers and programming increased exponentially after finding AOL, and I began writing my own BASIC games, and the like. &nbsp;When I was 12 years old, a friend&#8217;s father, a very famous programmer himself, offered to give me a free copy of Visual Basic, version 3&#8230;. and spurred what would become the very first piece of my <b>illuminati mind control</b>&nbsp;puzzle.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Back in those days, the <b>freewarez</b>&nbsp;<i>kiddies</i>, as we were called, were using visual basic programs to help transfer pirated software and &#8220;<i>hack&#8221; AOL. &nbsp;</i>It seemed then, and still feels on the surface, that it might have been somewhat normal for such young children, with no access to money, to be so enamored with the ability to explore video games, high end programming and design software, without having to pay. &nbsp;There was a hidden key though, and that was the themes that were being co-opted by the child programmers whose &#8220;curiosity&#8221; was their only self-proclaimed crime.</p>
<div>
<blockquote class="tr_bq"><p>I would later find out that many, actually, all of the people who were involved in this movement, were programming similar programs with the same <i>hellish</i>&nbsp;theme, all went to fancy private schools.. in Florida, Michigan, and Canada. &nbsp;&nbsp;Schools which were within close geographic proximity of powerful &#8216;ndrangheta families, and we were all&#8230; about the same age. &nbsp;<b>Very young</b>, compared to most of our peers at the time. &nbsp;In hindsight, my abilities at programming and the ease with which I took in new information seem more than possible. &nbsp;For whatever reason, this program brought together well educated youth from around the globe, and concentrated them in a social setting revolving around the internet. &nbsp;In the years that follow, this online circle of friends would create an exit path to real life friends&#8230; ones who were members of the &#8216;ndrangheta.</p></blockquote>
</div>
</div>
<div class="separator" style="clear:both;text-align:center;"><a href="https://silenceandbetrayal.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/aohell12.png" style="clear:right;float:right;margin-bottom:1em;margin-left:1em;"><img border="0" height="128" src="https://silenceandbetrayal.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/aohell1.png?w=200&#038;h=128" width="200" /></a></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">On AOL, in the early nineties, the most prolific and commonly used program for these purposes was <i>AOHell</i>. &nbsp;It was a play on words, and its creator, <i>Da Chronic</i>, themed Steven Case (the owner, and genius behind the&#8230; very lucky&#8230; reverse takeover of TimeWarner) as Satan himself, complaining of high fees and lack of freedom, much like Kevin Mitnick did. &nbsp;Out of this world of, stealing from the &#8220;rich&#8221; corporotocracy, and freedom of &#8230;. software and <i>learning</i>&nbsp;spawned a <a href="http://lenshellarchive.com/hell.html">demonically themed world of programs</a> designed to help. &nbsp;Lucifer<i>X</i> the Light Bringer.. <i>for the fledgling world of computing.</i>&nbsp; I saw the theme, and in my perfect hindsight named my copy of AOHell: &nbsp;<i><b>Doomsday</b>.</i>&nbsp; I say hindsight here, however my intent at the time was none other than to fit the general theme started by AOHell, and my choice of names certainly had no insight into the <i>Ministry of Forbidden Knowledge </i>which would appear &#8230; twenty years later. &nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Some might call it a coincidence, I personally <i>know</i> it is not. &nbsp;</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">Towards the &#8216;end&#8217; of my ordeal with <i>OSEH/gang-stalking</i>&nbsp;I would have a conversation with Mary, in which she responded verbally and obviously to something I was thinking. &nbsp;I wondered often the reason I was brought into this strange and dark world&#8230; and in a car ride home from the beach the <i>idea</i>&nbsp;that AOL was tied to the Illuminati was inserted synthetically into my thoughts&#8230; <i>maybe its a karma thing&#8230; </i>I thought.</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><i><br /></i></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><i>&#8220;</i>Big Karma thing,&#8221; she said, in the intonation I had come to know was indicative of her &#8220;reading lines&#8221; from another source. &nbsp;She had no way to know what I was thinking, as usual&#8230; right?</div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><i><br /></i></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;">As soon as I arrived at home, I googled &#8220;Karma and AOL and Satan,&#8221; and&nbsp;found this:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.xent.com/FoRK-archive/spring96/0277.html">http://www.xent.com/FoRK-archive/spring96/0277.html</a><i>&nbsp;</i></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><span style="text-align:start;"><br /></span></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><span style="text-align:start;">It was posted in 1996, by a man with my name, from a school I had wanted to attend. &nbsp;His handle was &#8220;I Find Karma.&#8221; &nbsp;A chill ran down my spine. This had to be a planted message, there is no way it could be real.</span></div>
<div style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace;font-size:xx-small;text-align:start;"><br /></span></div>
<div style="border:1px;">
<div style="text-align:justify;"><span style="font-family:'Courier New', Courier, monospace;font-size:xx-small;text-align:start;">An AOL/Satan strategic partnership?</span></div>

</div>
<div style="text-align:start;"><span style="font-family:Courier New, Courier, monospace;font-size:xx-small;">I had to do a double-take to realize this wasn&#8217;t legit.</span></p>

(AOL) and Satan<br />today announced a far-reaching strategic partnership. Under terms of the<br />agreement, AOL will license the souls of all mankind. Under the pact, AOL<br />agreed to seamlessly integrate the Dark Lord&#8217;s plans for the domination of<br />the world into their client software. &#8220;Our agreement is tremendous win-win<br />for us and for humanity&#8221;, Beelzebub was quoted as saying. CEO Steve &#8220;hanky<br />panky&#8221; Case was quoted as saying, &#8220;after devouring the souls of our<br />employees, well&#8230; we&#8217;ve just got a taste for it now. And hey, it could be<br />worse&#8230; look at Microsoft&#8230;&#8221; But, of course, the alliance with Satan was<br />just the next anticipated step after the announcement was made this morning<br />that America Online&#8217;s integrated browser will be Internet Explorer. As one<br />AOL employee was quoted as saying: we sold our soul to the devil..i wonder<br />what we get out of it? A fellow employee, replied: an icon on the desktop of<br />hell.</span></div>

<p><span style="color:#001320;"><span style="line-height:21px;">Mary is my friend, my ex-wife, and the mother of my son. &nbsp;We were the best of friends, and the best of lovers for a long, long time. &nbsp;True partners in crime, our escapades brought us all over the land, and brought smiles to our faces for years. &nbsp;She was born on 8/9, the anniversary of the day a great weapon was unleashed against many innocents in Nagasaki, and together we&nbsp;symbolically&nbsp;start and end that great war. &nbsp;It&#8217;s also the day <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danny_Casolaro#Death">Danny Casolaro</a> died, the man who came closest to identifying the source of the scourge infesting our lives and the world. &nbsp;We met through a very convoluted maze of life, that at one time seemed like serendipity, and now seems closer to an ill begotten fate. &nbsp;The sadness that has become of our union is beyond rational comprehension, however the story is so full of pertinent truth that it is before you today.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color:#001320;font-family:inherit;"><span style="line-height:21px;">Our story is a sad tale of abusive deception and reflexive control, the purpose of which still remains a mystery as I write, though I hope to find truth by the end of this work. &nbsp;It is a story I did not want to tell until it had the prototypical happy ending which pervades modern day literature. &nbsp;Today I fear it cannot wait, as I have now seen what I believe to be a message of warning hidden within. &nbsp;The message is to the world, its a warning about not <i>loving thy neighbor</i>, and giving up freedom and hope in exchange for a false sense of security. &nbsp;I will try to make these parallels clear as the story goes on, and I hope to convey to you an urgency of change in how we deal with each other and the world around us. &nbsp;</span></span><br /><span style="color:#001320;font-family:inherit;"><span style="line-height:21px;"><br /></span></span><span style="color:#001320;font-family:inherit;"><span style="line-height:21px;">I am a victim of something most people do not believe in. &nbsp;Those that do are either victims themselves, or know one <i>very, very </i>well. &nbsp;The story you are about to hear is <i>true</i>, despite its unbelievability and closeness to science fiction or fantasy. &nbsp;What happened to myself and Mary will seem odd to you, but it is <i>not</i>&nbsp;in this day in age. &nbsp;It is happening all around the world, in major cities, and the victims of <b>mind control</b>&nbsp;cry loudly only to have their tears fall on deaf ears. &nbsp;</span></span><br /><span style="color:#001320;font-family:inherit;"><span style="line-height:21px;"><br /></span></span><span style="color:#001320;font-family:inherit;"><span style="line-height:21px;">The winding dark maze of my early life has been straightened for me, by <i>a</i>&nbsp;higher power; things which seemed unconnected and insignificant now take on a great meaning as the unfolding of my story parallels what I believe to be a prophetic vision of the story you will all know to be true&#8230; in the not so near future. &nbsp;</span></span></p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#001320;font-family:inherit;"><span style="line-height:21px;"><i>there is no magic in this realm</i></span></span></div>

<div style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#001320;"><span style="line-height:21px;"><i>a blinding light shining from beyond</i></span></span></div>
<div style="text-align:center;"><span style="color:#001320;"><span style="line-height:21px;"><i>proof if anyone cared to look&nbsp;</i></span></span></div>
