					<description><![CDATA[I like this blog. It&#039;s good to see that there are some theories out there that actually make sense. I too believe that Stargate was a cover up for psychotronic research/experiments/operations/projects. I think they found really intelligent people and just fooled them.Good call on the Raytheon link.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[...XDOccam&#039;s Razor applied simply to logic says, the most likely answer is the simplest.A few examples:&#034;What&#039;s more likely?&#034;3)The Stargate Project, if it even actually existed, found no superhuman talents in humans. The &#034;purported ability&#034; was just that: purported, nothing more.&#034;How bout this one?&#034;3) The CIA and NSA have no &#034;vast network of hyper-spectral satellites which can see through walls,&#034; or deep into the ground, or through anything. &#034;Or this:&#034;The federal government does not have the ability to solve most crimes without much effort. It is not god, it is not all-powerful.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Nice post.  It&#039;s a shame there&#039;s no truth in it.  Imagine, the CIA can see through walls and deep underground with satellites but had to have someone tell them where Osama Bin Laden was to get him.  Reality should always be preferred to fantasy ]]></description>
