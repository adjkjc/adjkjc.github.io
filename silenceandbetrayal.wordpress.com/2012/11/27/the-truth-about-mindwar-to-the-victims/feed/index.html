					<description><![CDATA[Suicidal thoughts are most likely caused by the entity itself.  I have spoken to many victims who feel the same way.  Let me remind you that there are many victims of both gang stalking and &#034;V2K&#034; who eventually do get almost complete relief. Removing yourself from the equation, especially being a well educated and credible target, only hurts our cause.  Together we can solve this problem, and make the world a better place for future generations.  I would definitely counsel against euthanasia, if you do feel that way, I would, myself, prefer to seek psychiatric help rather than lose my ability to speak out against the injustice perpetrated on me.  As I am researching, it appears that this entity has been using schizophrenia as a weapon/mechanism for hiding its existence for some time.  I would not say that all cases are a result of it, however its high co-ocurrence with highly educated people, and late life onset, are neurological evidence that at least some cases may be caused by an external influence.  Leaving &lt;b&gt;our truth&lt;/b&gt; in the psychiatric record, that we believe it is externally caused and have personal evidence of as much, can only serve to help future generations.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Frankly, I think we agree more than you see.  I think we describe both its capabilities as well as some of its methodologies very similarly.  I don&#039;t find it incompetent at all, and I think my personal experience has to do more with its dealings with the so called &#034;Illuminati&#034; than myself.  I think where we differ is that I see a long term plan being acted out by not only this entity, but also a large group of humans that appear to be assisting it.  In reality, I believe this large group is being &#034;set up,&#034;  both by using its assistance against it... and probably because of it.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Yes, secrecy might be one of its methods. My point was that it would be so advanced in its capabilities of mind control that it wouldn&#039;t have to make bargains with anyone, period. Turns out you think it&#039;s not very advanced at all, that it would have to make the person a zombie and it can&#039;t even get rid of you. We obviously differ a whole lot here. To me, many synchronicities as well as psychoses are obvious proof that mind control is indeed so advanced you wouldn&#039;t have a chance if the entity wanted you dead in a seeming accident or wanted you to kill yourself. In the latter case, it could make you depressed for a couple of years just to give you a history of depression.But no. You think you&#039;ve escaped death many times because of incompetence on the part of the entity. Even if I thought you were right about its existence, I&#039;d still think you&#039;re nuts for thinking that. It&#039;d be much more likely you were meant simply to THINK there have been attempts on your life.Have you read books on the paranormal, esp. books on psychic powers? You guys here talk like you were completely unaware of a history thousands of years long involving all sorts of incredible phenomena and powers. So either humans have these great powers, and they&#039;ve completely missed the existence of this entity or the entity is so powerful even clairvoyants have been unable to notice and report its existence. Or it doesn&#039;t exist.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Keeping its existence secret is very relevant, its exactly why its use is subtle in most cases, and restricts significantly the types of attack employed.I have had numerous &#034;accidental&#034; attempts on my life, both before and after knowing why.  These attempts have been linked with obvious synchronicities to the Illuminati.More to the point, one of the major facets of my personal story is a direct attack on my credibility, using mind control.  This is a major reason for its public recording here.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Moreover, it would be the easiest thing in the world for the supposed entity to cause an accident whenever someone, especially someone as insignificant as you or me, is becoming a nuisance or a threat. Yet that doesn&#039;t seem to be happening. There are innumerable deadly accidents in the West every year, yet we&#039;re both still alive. ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I was assuming you both thought that the entity could control minds without the target having any clue his actions aren&#039;t perfectly natural, at least more so than most people when they occasionally wonder why they did something stupid or whatever. In any case, many synchronicities point to the existence of just such mind control, very sophisticated, very hard to notice directly, so you&#039;re argument about &#034;keeping the capabilities and existence secret&#034; is completely irrelevant.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;d be more than happy to discus why there IS a monolithic and inhuman entity behind this phenomenon in chat.  That being said, your ideas are sound in one sense, and not well thought out in another.  Regardless of whether or not the &#034;system&#034; can control minds and would not require cooperation, hiding its capabilities and/or existence would be paramount.  Just because it could make you into a mind controlled zombie doesn&#039;t mean that would be the optimum use of the technology.Read Sirhan Sirhan&#039;s story, for an idea as to why you would NOT do that.  Then read Mark David Chapman&#039;s, and realize why tricking not only the victim but the world would be more intelligent.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sorry, Don, if the system can control minds, then it makes no sense to ask someone to &#034;cooperate&#034;. The system can just make him cooperate, even without his realising it, period.Re the article above, how does the writer know that mind control is accomplished via quantum entanglement? Could the writer elaborate on the mechanism? If not, then I&#039;ll take that as evidence of his ignorance regarding the mechanism as a whole.That said, I&#039;ve come to a SOMEWHAT similar conclusion, which you can read about on my blog (my handle links to it).I suppose I should write more about why I think there&#039;s no Lovecraftian entity behind these phenomena, but I guess if people can&#039;t figure such things out on their own, then it&#039;s meant to be. I&#039;ll say tho that one reason is that history and such things make more sense from my perspective.]]></description>
