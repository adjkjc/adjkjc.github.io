    <h4><a name="CN_4002"><font color="#cc0000">4002. Albin
          Counter-Gambit</font></a></h4>
    <p>Given that 1 d4 d5 2 c4 e5 is known to have been played in the
      1880s and 1890s, we are not sure what to make of the following
      item on page 390 of the <i>Literary Digest</i>, 29 September
      1900:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p align="center"><i>‘The St Paul Gambit</i></p>
      <p>Several players in the Munich tournament played a
        counter-gambit to the Queen’s Gambit Declined with considerable
        success. This move is Black’s second ...e5 instead of the usual
        ...e6. The game goes like this: 1 d4 d5 2 c4 e5 3 dxe5 d4, etc.</p>
      <p>This variation was discovered by George B. Spencer, St Paul,
        Minn., and named by him the St Paul Gambit. It has not met with
        great favor as it was considered, if not unsound, very risky,
        but Marshall, who first used it in match-play, pronounces it all
        right.’</p>

          Self-mate</font></a></h4>
    <a name="CN_4003">
      <p>Michael McDowell (Westcliff-on-sea, England) quotes from page
        20 of <i>The Problem Art </i>by Thomas B. Rowland and
        Frideswide F. Rowland (published in 1887):</p>
      <blockquote><i>‘Some years back there was a strong prejudice
          against self-mate problems, and even still there are a few who
          are not favourably disposed towards them, and who declare that
          they are “not chess”. The inaccuracy of such an allegation
          becomes manifest on reflecting that forcing an opponent to
          give mate is and has been recognized as odds given by an
          advanced player to a beginner, or weak player. At a chess
          meeting recently held at Bradford, Dr Zukertort not only gave
          these odds but actually specified the pawn which he would
          compel his opponent, Mr Mark Dawson, to mate with. The feat
          was successfully accomplished by the champion.’</i></blockquote>
      <p>Mr McDowell comments:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><i>‘I wonder if the score of the above-mentioned game exists.
            The only game at “self-mate odds” of which I am aware is the
            Paris v Marseilles game given on pages 216-217 of Chernev’s
          </i>The Chess Companion<i>.’</i></p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>We note that in the second (1897) edition of the Rowlands’ book
        the references to Bradford and Dawson were deleted, and that the
        passage finished (after ‘or weak player’): ‘Dr Zukertort not
        only gave these odds but actually specified the pawn which he
        would compel his opponent to mate with.’</p>

      <p>In the discussion on the nineteenth-century blind player ‘G.
        Lum(b)ley’ in C.N.s 3426 and 3443 very little about him could be
        stated positively. Now, though, Owen Hindle (Cromer, England)
        has found out more:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><i>‘The chess column in </i>Cassell’s Illustrated Family
          Paper <i>for 17 March 1855, page 87, contains the following
            in the “Answers To Our Chess Correspondents” section:</i></p>
        <blockquote><i> </i>
          <p>“GEORGE MADDISON. – The specimens sent exhibit some talent
            for the construction of chess problems. They are not,
            however, sufficiently difficult for publication. We are much
            gratified that your friend, who as you state, is so
            seriously afflicted, can find solace in this intellectual
            pastime. We are somewhat curious to know by what means he
            has acquired a knowledge of the game.”</p>

            Maddison, but do not provide answers to the above question.)</i></p>
        <p><i>In the columns for 7 April 1855, page 111, and 14 April
            1855, page 119, George Lumley is noted as a successful
            solver of two chess problems.</i></p>
        <p><i>The 1851 British Census lists a George Maddison, aged 31,
            as a teacher of basket-making at the Charles Road Blind

        <p><i>Amongst the “inmates”, as they are described, is George
            Lumley, aged 15, a basket-maker, born in Manchester.</i></p>

            Manchester, living as a boarder in Wellington Street in the
            Holy Trinity parish of Kingston upon Hull. He is described
            as a Chess Tutor, and it is noted that he is “Blind not from

          inadvertently allowed a threefold repetition. I claimed, he
          demurred, and as we waited for the arbiter I was overcome by
          guilt (I had learnt much from his </i>Chess for Match
        Players) <i>and confusion, and made a move. Then I realized
          again that I was right after all. Willie still agreed the draw
          even though I had invalidated my claim.</i></p>
      <p><i>I never thought of Willie as “short”. Heights generally were
          lower then than now, but I guess he was about five feet five
          or six (1 metre 65-67). The group photograph taken at
          Nottingham, 1936 shows him looking very unhappy with his legs
          intertwined, but not appearing specially small.</i></p>

          a small man, and believe his height may have helped him (less

          big reputation. I never saw Flohr give a simul, but witnessed
          Karpov twice ambushed by very strong teams of English juniors

          on 2-10 August 1945 is one of the lesser-known events in which

          information are the books on Alekhine by P. Morán (Spanish and

      <p align="center"><font size="-1">Joseph William Hunt</font></p>
      <p>It was in the 1890s that the opening gained in familiarity
        (after Schlechter’s quick defeat of Fleissig in 1893, a famous
        game often misdated 1895), but at that time the heading
        ‘Irregular Opening’ was generally used. Hunt’s name was
        associated with 1 b4 only occasionally (e.g. on page 203 of <i>La








          Stratégie</i>, 15 July 1895). On the other hand, neither the
        obituary of Hunt in the <i>BCM</i> (July 1920, page 227) nor
        the autobiographical feature on pages 384-387 of the September
        1902 issue mentioned the opening. The latter item does, however,
        contain the following information:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>‘The only public tournament I ever entered was that of the
          Counties’ Chess Association, held at Oxford. There I was
          fortunate enough to draw with the Revs. Owen and Skipworth,
          and beat Trenchard, though I was nowhere after all.’</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>That tournament was in 1891, but did Hunt play 1 b4 in any of
        his games?</p>

    <p>Following on from the previous item, here are some references
      concerning the opening move 1 b4:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>C.N. 55 (see page 86 of <i>Chess Explorations</i>) gave the
        score of Skipworth v Cuthbertson, Challenge Cup Tourney, 1868,
        which began 1 b4 e5 2 Bb2 d6. Our source was <i>Land and Water</i>,
        21 June 1873, and it remains the oldest 1 b4 game we have found.</li>
      <li>Schlechter’s celebrated victory as Black (1 b4 e6 2 Bb2 Nf6)
        in 1893 over Fleissig was published on pages 52-53 of the
        February 1894 <i>Deutsche Schachzeitung</i>, but only Fleissig
        was named. </li>
      <li>On pages 294-295 of <i>Deutsches Wochenschach</i>, 5
        September 1897 Schlechter annotated his win against Tarrasch in
        Nuremberg, July 1897 (1 b4 d5 2 Bb2 Bf5). It was called the
        Englisch Opening, and in addition to stating that Englisch was
        the first to essay 1 b4 in serious match play Schlechter
        reported that he himself had played it in a tournament game
        against Marco.</li>
      <li>A correspondence game beginning 1 b4 e5 2 Bb2 d5 was given on
        pages 176-177 of the November 1898 <i>Wiener Schachzeitung</i>
        (Stör v Seidl, 1897-98).</li>
      <li>Zuckerbäcker v A. Neumann, Vienna, 20 December 1898 opened 1
        b4 e5 2 Bb2 Bxb4. (<i>Wiener Schachzeitung</i>, January 1899,
        pages 13-14.)</li>
      <li> C.N. 1745 reported that page 164 of the August 1906 <i>American
Chess









          Bulletin</i> had the game Delmar v Marshall, Brooklyn, 1906 (1
        b4 e5 2 Bb2 Nc6). See page 157 of <i>Kings, Commoners and
          Knaves</i>.</li>
      <li>An article entitled ‘Die Eröffnung 1 b2-b4’ by C. von
        Bardeleben was published on pages 329-330 of the 27 September
        1914 <i>Deutsches Wochenschach</i>.</li>
      <li>‘1 P.4CD: L’ouverture de l’Orang-Outang’ by S. Tartakower, on
        pages 145-150 of <i>Les Cahiers de l’Echiquier Français</i>,
        September-October 1933. Tartakower stated that the opening was
        also named after ‘Hunter’ (<i>sic</i>) and ‘Berthold English’ (<i>sic</i>),









        adding that the latter frequently adopted it in serious play.
        Mention was made of the draw by Englisch against Pillsbury in
        1896 (of which the opening moves were 1 b4 e5 2 Bb2 f6).</li>
      <li>Page 414 of <i>CHESS</i>, 14 August 1938: Tartakower again
        explained (as in the preceding item) how the name ‘Orang-Outang’
        had been bestowed by him as the result of a visit to a New York
        zoo in 1924.</li>
      <li>Tartakower also discussed the christening on pages 70-71 of
        his first volume of <i>Best Games</i>. On page 173 he wrote of
        1 b4, ‘The ultimate truth in chess?’</li>
      <li>Page 16 of <i>Chess Review</i>, January 1950 stated that
        Englisch was the ‘first promoter’ of 1 b4.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Further information is sought. In particular, was Skipworth the
      first to play 1 b4, in 1868, and what more is known about the
      involvement of Hunt and Englisch?</p>

        Neil McDonald in December 2005. There should, therefore, be time
        for the master’s forename to be corrected to Rudolf.</p>
      <p>Rudolf was the spelling used by Jack Spence in his Spielmann
        trilogy, although confusion arose when the Chess Player became
        the publisher (i.e. with Rudolph on the front cover and Rudolf
        on the title page). In contrast, Eric Schiller’s 1996 book on
        Spielmann had Rudolf on the front cover and Rudolph on the title
        page (as well as everywhere else). However, in all the books,
        signatures, etc. of Spielmann himself that we have seen he used
        Rudolf, and no justification for Rudolph is apparent. Similarly,
        it is unclear on what grounds A. Soltis often, though not
        always, writes ‘Karl’ Schlechter.</p>

    <p>Miquel Artigas (Sabadell, Spain) has discovered two further
      photographs taken at Sabadell, 1945:</p>
    <div align="center"><i><img alt="sabadell"

    <br>
    <p>Then there is the Terrazas mystery to which we drew attention in
      C.N. 4008. On page 227 of <i>A. Alekhine Agony of a Chess Genius</i>
      by P. Morán (Jefferson, 1989) the translator, Frank X. Mur, added
      the following note at the end of the Terrazas v Alekhine game:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>‘Alekhine’s victim was 11 years old. Years later he wrote: “I
        only recall that the imposing figure of an Alekhine made one
        play with a deep reverential awe, especially at that age.” –
        Filiberto Terrazas to Frank X. Mur, letter dated 19 January
        1979.’</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>As mentioned in the earlier C.N. item, it may be wondered how
      Terrazas could have been only 11 years old, given the photograph
      of him provided by Mr Artigas. A further consideration is that the
      original Spanish edition of Morán’s book (Madrid, 1972) gave no
      forename, or even initial, for Terrazas. So was he really
      Filiberto? A (Mexican) player of that name certainly existed, but
      Mr Artigas writes:</p>
    <blockquote><i><i>‘In Sabadell there was a player named Teodoro
          Terrazas Elizando. In the 1944-45 season he was registered
          with the Federación Catalana de Ajedrez as a first-category
          player for the Sabadell club, and I have been lucky enough to
          find his identity card for that season. I am almost sure that
          he was the participant in Sabadell, 1945, but further checking
          is required.’ </i></i></blockquote>

    <p>As if one Sabadell mystery (the Terrazas matter) were not enough,
      we revert here to the second photograph in C.N. 4015, of which a
      larger version is given now:</p>

      </i></div>
    <p>From the identification of the players at the bottom of the
      demonstration board it would seem clear that Alekhine was facing
      Muñoz, yet the position bears no relation to that game as
      presented on pages 231-233 of <i>A. Alekhine Agony of a Chess
        Genius</i> by P. Morán (1 d4 d5 2 c4 e6 3 Nf3 Nf6 4 Bg5 Bb4+ 5
      Nc3 dxc4 6 e4 c5 7 Bxc4 cxd4 8 Nxd4 Qa5 9 Bxf6 Bxc3+ 10 bxc3 Qxc3+
      11 Kf1 Qxc4+ 12 Kg1 O-O 13 Qg4 g6 14 e5 Nc6 15 Nf5 Resigns). Nor
      have we been able to match the position in the photograph with any
      other game.</p>
    <p>Is it possible, therefore, that Morán’s book was mistaken about
      the score of the Alekhine v Muñoz game? Investigating such a
      matter is difficult, not least because his book failed to supply
      sources. The same 15-move game was also given as Alekhine v Muñoz
      on page 728 of <i>Alexander Alekhine’s Chess Games, 1902-1946</i>
      by L.M. Skinner and R.G.P. Verhoeven (Jefferson, 1998), but the
      source specified was merely Morán’s book.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, if Morán was correct that the 15-move game
      occurred between Alekhine and Muñoz, how is the above photograph
      to be explained?</p>

          Beginner’s Book’</font></a></h4>
    <a name="CN_4017">
      <p>C.J.S. Purdy was a consummate chess teacher, and it is
        therefore of interest to note his choice of ‘the very best
        beginner’s book’, on page 157 of <i>Chess World</i>, October
        1963. Below is an abridged version of his remarks:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>‘Is there one beginner’s book that is better than all the
          others? ... Up till now we have never had a sure answer ...
          Now we have. It is <i>Learn Chess</i> by C.H.O’D. Alexander
          and T.J. Beach. ... There is not one ambiguous or difficult
          sentence, or even word, in the whole book. ... We seldom
          praise a book so highly. We think most chess books have
          something good in them and are worth reading despite a
          percentage of twaddle. But here is a book which, for the
          players it’s intended for, is 100% good. Don’t forget, it is
          for genuine beginners, not for near-average players. It is
          excellent for children, and excellent for adults.’</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><i>Learn Chess</i> was first published in 1963, in two volumes.
        It has been republished a number of times, e.g. by Cadogan Chess
        in 1994 as a single volume (algebraic notation). </p>

    <p>Bernd Graefrath (Mülheim an der Ruhr, Germany) points out that
      there was a brief feature on ‘Inverse Chess’ (including the score
      of the Paris v Marseilles game) on pages 464-465 of <i>Brentano’s
        Chess Monthly</i>, January 1882. The text reads:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>‘Playing chess to lose, that is to compel your adversary to
        mate you, is practised to a considerable extent in Europe,
        especially in France. The game has never been recognized in this
        country, and we do not know that any chess periodical has
        published any specimens of this method of play. Taking advantage
        of the good nature which we know usually prevails at this season
        we venture <i>agere libertate Decembri</i>, and present our
        readers with a curiosity in the shape of one of those games <i>à
          qui perd gagne</i>. It is one of several which were played by
        correspondence a year or two ago between Paris and Marseilles.
        Paris gives the queen, and Marseilles undertakes to compel
        self-mate.’</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>We note that the following brief report on page 149 of the
      April-May 1879 <i>La Stratégie</i> offered to make the
      above-mentioned game-score available to readers upon request and,
      furthermore, named the players:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><i>‘Nous avons reçu de M. A. Demonchy de Marseille une très
          curieuse et intéressante partie inverse jouée par
          correspondance avec M. A. Nicolas de Paris. Ce dernier qui
          rendait la dame a été obligé de faire mat au 69ème coup. M.
          Demonchy ayant mis à notre disposition quelques exemplaires

              this problem is rather odd, as Mansfield had combined

              changes the mate for 1…N(x)b1 from 2 Bb3 to 2 Rb5.
              Mansfield’s setting, however, suffers from the severe
              defect that the d1 bishop is useless after the key, and
              the problem is sound without it. Benko’s is much the

        Photographs of Alekhine</font></h4>
    <p>From Steve Wrinn (Homer, NY, USA):</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><i>‘Alekhine to me has always possessed a rather protean image
          in photographs: in certain shots he appears handsome,
          confident and self-possessed, while in others his appearance
          is very much the reverse. Two striking examples of this
          contrast are the photograph of Alekhine in the Berne, 1932
          tournament book and the one of him at Nottingham, 1936 which
          appeared in the obituary article on page 16 of the April 1946
        </i>Chess Review<i>:</i></p>
      <div align="center"><i><img alt="alekhine"

        </i></div>
      <p><i>The former is, in my opinion, one of the best of Alekhine,
          and shows a self-assured and still somewhat youthful champion
          at the height of his powers. Those are hardly adjectives one
          would apply to the man in the Nottingham photograph just four
          years later (four years which, of course, included the loss of
          the world championship and a less-than-optimal lifestyle). To
          judge from the position on the board, the Nottingham
          photograph was taken during Alekhine’s first-round game
          against Flohr, just after the “</i>lapsus manus<i>” 4 Bd2 and
          Flohr’s reply 4...dxe4.’</i></p>

    <p>Below we add another Nottingham, 1936 photograph, from page 229
      of the October 1936 <i>Chess Review</i>:</p>

    <p>The caption stated that the seated onlooker was the <i>Review’s</i>
      correspondent Paul Hugo Litwinsky (who later changed his surname
      to Little).</p>
    <p> Our correspondent also writes:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p><i>‘On pages 90-91 of </i>Achieving the Aim <i>(Oxford, 1981)
          Botvinnik writes about visiting Triberg in 1973 and being
          shown a then-unpublished photograph of Bogoljubow and
          Alekhine, taken around 1922. This picture, says Botvinnik,
          gave him a better understanding of the young Alekhine, a far
          different man from the one he met in person in 1936-38: </i>
      </p>
      <blockquote><i> </i>
        <p>“Alekhine was gesticulating with his right hand and, with
          raised eyebrows and a sly look on his face, was relating
          something. ... There was so much expressiveness, humour,
          spiritual strength and calm certainty in his appearance that I
          understood how he could withstand the severity of the struggle
          with the great Cuban and take the world championship.”</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><i>I wonder if this photograph has been published anywhere
          since 1973. It would be a delight to see it.’</i></p>
    </blockquote>

      worth comparing:</p>

    <p>The first, a rare instance (from 1943) of one leading master
      inscribing a photograph of himself to another, comes from <i>Meie

      the frontispiece of the first volume of <i>Alechin&#367;v šachový

    <blockquote>
      <p><i>‘I have been reading an excellent work, </i>The Code Book<i>
          by Simon Singh, first published in 1999 and with a paperback
          edition issued in 2000. It describes various historical and
          current aspects of ciphering and deciphering messages, and one
          of the chapters deals with the activities of the British
          intelligence services during World War II, which proved
          crucial for the Allies’ victory. I quote from page 178 the
          author’s description of the bizarre mixture of people involved
          in deciphering enemy messages:</i></p>
      <blockquote><i>“... in addition to the mathematicians and
          linguists, there was an authority on porcelain, a curator from
          the Prague Museum, the British chess champion and numerous
          bridge experts.” </i></blockquote>
      <p><i>The chess champion is not named, but it would seem to be
          C.H.O’D. Alexander, who had won the most recent championship,
          in 1938. </i> </p>
      <p><i>The following page quotes from a letter dated 21 October
          1941 written by some of the criptanalysts to the British Prime
          Minister, Winston Churchill, to appeal for additional staff.
          It was signed by A.M. Turing, W.G. Welchman, C.H.O’D.
          Alexander and P.S. Milner-Barry. Churchill immediately issued
          a positive response.</i></p>
      <p><i>Milner-Barry (“one of the Hut 6 cryptanalysts”) is cited as
          follows on page 186:</i></p>
      <blockquote><i>“I do not imagine that any war since classical
          times, if ever, has been fought in which one side read
          consistently the main military and naval intelligence of the
          other.”<i>’</i> </i></blockquote>

      code-breakers, together with the complete text of the letter to

      </i></div>
    <p>P.S. Milner-Barry wrote about his and Alexander’s code-breaking
      work on pages 3-5 of Golombek and Hartston’s <i>The Best Games of
        C.H.O’D. Alexander </i>(Oxford, 1976) and included the
      following tantalizing comment:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>‘Much has been written lately about what came out of Bletchley,
        but only from the point of view of the user. Security
        restrictions on the story of the breaking of the Enigma from the
        technical point of view have not yet been lifted. I still hope
        that they may be in my time. It would, I believe, make an
        enthralling story which would be particularly fascinating to
        chessplayers. For both Hugh and myself it was rather like
        playing a tournament game (sometimes several games) every day
        for five and a half years.’</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Milner-Barry lived until 1995. Dare it be hoped that he wrote up
      his recollections of the 1940s?</p>
    <p>Harry Golombek, who died the same year as Milner-Barry, was also
      at Bletchley Park. In his obituary of Jacob Bronowski on pages
      441-443 of the December 1974 <i>BCM</i> he recalled being
      heartily recommended to an Intelligence Department of the Foreign
      Office by his artillery commanding officer on the grounds that ‘I
      had too much brains to be behind the guns’. On page 131 of his <i>Encyclopedia









        of Chess</i> (London, 1977) Golombek stated that he was at
      Bletchley Park ‘like Alexander, Milner-Barry and quite a number of
      other chessplayers’. Who were the others?</p>
    <p>We note, finally, the following on page 162 of Simon Singh’s
      book:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>‘Initially, Bletchley Park had a staff of only two hundred, but
        within five years the mansion and the huts would house seven
        thousand men and women.’</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>‘Staunton was pompous and bombastic, a self-appointed dictator
        of the chess world. On one occasion a rival published a
        statement that he had won the majority of his games with
        Staunton. The next time they met Staunton thundered, “You can’t
        print that!” His rival stammered feebly that the statement was
        true. “What’s that got to do with it? Of course it’s true!”,
        Staunton raged. “But you still can’t print it!”’</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In C.N. 1624 (see pages 132-134 of <i>Chess Explorations</i>) we
      quoted Chernev’s version of the anecdote in <i>The Bright Side of
        Chess</i>, as well as a (significantly different) account by
      G.A. MacDonnell in the <i>Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News</i>.
      In both cases Staunton’s rival was named as Löwenthal. Do any
      other nineteenth-century sources discuss the alleged episode?</p>

      <p>This position arose on 25 November 1962 in a game between
        C.J.S. Purdy and O. Sarapu on board one of a match by
        teleprinter between Sydney and Auckland. We quote from pages 16
        and 32 of <i>Chess World</i>, February 1963:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>‘At the suggestion of Lajos Steiner, the Sydney player
          [Purdy] was required to demonstrate a win, but he only found
          time for a little perfunctory analysis which Sarapu could not
          admit as adequate. As Sarapu is in regular correspondence with
          Grandmaster Paul Keres, he suggested that he send the position
          to him to look at, and Purdy naturally jumped at this.</p>
        <p>Keres very kindly did look at it, in response to a request
          from his old friend (they were at school together – we mention
          this because it would be a solecism to make such a request
          without a background of this sort). Naturally Keres was not
          prepared to adjudicate officially, “but”, writes Sarapu, “the
          variations he shows have convinced me clearly that there is
          nothing I can do against them.” Accordingly Sarapu admits the
          game as a loss ...</p>
        <p>Keres’ analysis seems so simple that we feel a bit ashamed of
          not having worked it out even in the short time we permitted
          ourselves to look at it. In a correspondence game we would no
          doubt have found it, but equally certainly would have taken a
          good deal longer than Keres. Readers may like to have a shot
          themselves. At first sight it seems impossible for White to
          avoid a draw; not only is it not impossible but Keres shows
          two ways, though both lead up to the same idea.</p>
        <p>... Keres’ winning plan is very simple. White must build a
          position with g3 and h4, so that if he got both rooks on the
          seventh and could evade perpetual check, he could mate at h7.
          So the problem is only to get his king to h2 in that position
          and his king’s-side rook either to e2 or f2, then play d8(Q),
          allow Black to take the queen and then double on the seventh
          rank. Black can then check once, and that is all.</p>
        <p>Keres gives two lines that lead to the win. The simpler is 1
          Kh2 Qd6+ 2 g3! Qd2+ 3 Kg1 Qd1+ 4 Kf2 Qd2+ 5 Re2 Qd3 (say).</p>
        <p>All White has to do then is first to protect his rear rook by
          playing it to b2, then march back with his king to h2; then
          play h4; then play his rook back to e2 or f2, whichever is
          available; then queen the pawn and after ...Qxd8 the final
          kill by doubling on the seventh. All this assumes that Black
          has not meanwhile chosen to lose by ...g5.</p>
        <p>The second and slower way of doing it starts with 1 Kh2 Qd6+
          2 Kg1 Qd1+ 3 Kf2 Qd2+ 4 Re2.</p>
        <p>In the first line, suppose Black comes out with his king,
          e.g. 6 Reb2 Kg5 7 Kg2 Kf6 (nothing else makes much sense) 8
          Rf2+ Ke6 (if 8...Ke7 he gets mated) 9 h4, and White is
          threatening Rf8. Black can win a rook but then White queens.
          Nor will ...Qd6 help as White then has Re2+ and Re8. In other
          words, bringing out the king is only frying-pan to fire.</p>
        <p>White has no need to hurry. Using the advanced passed pawn to
          keep the black queen semi-tied, White can slowly weave his
          web.’</p>

    <h4><a name="CN_4036"><font color="#cc0000" face="Times New Roman,
          serif">4036. Excuses for losing</font></a></h4>
    <a name="CN_4036">
      <p>In C.N. 3973 we mentioned G.H. Diggle’s high praise of ‘Excuses
        for Losing Games’ on pages 191-200 of <i>Chess Life-Pictures</i>
        by G.A. MacDonnell (London, 1883). Below is the full essay:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>‘The excuses made by chessplayers for making bad moves and
          losing games are of wonderful diversity. Sometimes they are
          ingenious and even rise to the height of considerable
          imaginative power.</p>
        <p>First let me notice the pre-prandial and post-prandial
          excuses. At one time it is, “I cannot play because I have not
          had my dinner”; and at another time, “I cannot play because I
          have had my dinner.” I have never yet had the good or the ill
          fortune to engage one of these gentlemen at the particular
          time when his chess powers were in real working order; and as
          all time must either precede or follow dinner, I am at a loss
          to conceive when such a player can conduct his game in a
          manner satisfactory to himself.</p>
        <p>I had a venerable cousin some years ago who enjoyed a
          considerable reputation as a player by correspondence. On one
          occasion I encountered him over the board. It was winter time
          and very cold. We were unable to get seats near the fire, and
          my opponent being very slow in his moves, I employed some of
          my leisure moments in wandering about the room, gazing at the
          boards of neighbouring players, and stopping at times to warm
          myself by the fire After a hard fight of some hours’ duration
          I won the game. My relative then challenged me to a second
          battle. The opening, I remember, was to be the same as in the
          first – an Evans gambit conducted by me, and compromisedly
          (very much so, indeed) defended by him. He was slower than
          ever, and once more I betook myself to the hearth. He glanced
          at me fretfully two or three times whilst cogitating over his
          move, and at length called me to him, and said authoritatively
          –</p>
        <p>“I must request you to resume your seat and not leave it
          again until the game is over. I lost the last game owing to
          your wandering about the room and distracting my attention. I
          can never play without having my opponent sitting opposite
          me.” I begged his pardon and, as he was old, I obeyed his
          orders.</p>
        <p>A favourite excuse with Mr O. for weak moves and lost games
          was, “My dear sir, I cannot attend to chess; I have my house
          and other fish to fry”, as though he were handicapped too
          heavily by having to fight a man who either lived all his life
          in the open air or, at best, in lodgings, and who never had
          cod or salmon dressed in the manner specified. By-the-bye,
          that was a strange excuse which Staunton made to an admirer of
          his for losing his match at pawn-and-two moves with Lowe:</p>
        <p>“You see, sir, the odds were too little; I could not play my
          best. I ought to have given him the knight.”</p>
        <p>I am happy to say the old headache excuse has long since been
          worn to shreds; so much so that no player, in London at all
          events, has the shamelessness to put it forward. But I do
          sometimes hear a man say when losing, “I can’t play today. I
          didn’t get to bed last night until 12”; or, “No wonder I make
          such blunders; I was travelling by rail for two hours
          yesterday.”</p>
        <p>I remember a distinguished player, no longer resident in
          London, who used to say, “I can’t help making mistakes when I
          play with Barnes. Whenever I lay a trap, or make a good
          combination, he has a habit of taking his cigar from his
          mouth, raising his eyes from the board, and glancing at me in
          a peculiarly furtive and knowing manner, as much as to say,
          ‘Surely you don’t expect to catch me in that way? No, my boy,
          I am a deal wiser than you fancy – in fact, wiser than
          yourself’.”</p>
        <p>At the Westminster Chess Club some years ago I used to give
          the odds of queen to a young friend who had special talents,
          but not for chess. I don’t know why, but I always played to
          trap his queen, and seldom failed to do so; and he accounted
          satisfactorily to himself for his weak play and constant
          defeats by the mortal dread of losing his queen that seized
          him from the very beginning of the game. But he used to get
          his revenge out of me by asking me the following puzzle, which
          I never could solve: “Can you tell me why it is that I always
          lose my queen?”</p>
        <p>Dear Mr E., whom everybody loves to see playing, ascribes his
          occasional failures to his inability to swallow other men’s
          smoke, especially when it is whirlwinded up his nose or down
          his back.</p>
        <p>In my young days I sometimes played an old gentleman to whom
          I gave large odds and generally a beating. He never would
          resign until he was checkmated, nor would he accept your
          resignation until the final <i>coup</i> was administered. His
          excuse – his constant excuse was that he could not play
          because people would open the door so often, and creak its
          hinges. One day, I remember well, it thundered, and on that
          occasion only did he vary his excuse, charging the atmosphere
          with his misfortunes.</p>
        <p>The door is a constant source of annoyance to some players. A
          member of the Westminster Club, a good-tempered fellow and
          excellent in all social ways, used, when playing, to expend a
          great portion of his time in watching the door, and if anyone
          left it wholly or partly open he would rush from his seat and
          close it with a bang, muttering to himself at the same time
          words which no mortal would particularly care to hear.</p>
        <p>Everyone – well, nearly everyone – knows Toun. I believe he
          has frequented the Divan for the last 50 years, and I
          sincerely hope he may spin out the period of his attendance to
          a century. He delights in chess and is a strict observer of
          the rules of the game. He is rich, and insists upon playing
          for the usual stake. He never accepts of any but the following
          trifling odds: choice of colour and of seats, first move, the
          draws, and three to one! He never allows any person to speak a
          word, much less make a suggestion, at his board, and glares
          ferociously at any good player who even stops for a moment to
          glance at the position of his game. I once happened to be at
          the next table to that at which he was playing. He lost, and
          immediately began to complain. To do him justice, I must say
          he never complains but when he has thrown away a won game.
          Thus did he explode: “I’ll play no more! I can’t play with
          Captain Cunningham making such a hideous noise!” “I?”, said
          the captain. “Why, I never opened my lips during the game.”
          “No, sir, I know you did not; but you were breathing hard!”</p>
        <p>“I cannot play with the black men, and so no wonder I have
          lost.” Now this excuse in itself is childish, because a
          practical, not to say a good, player ought not to let his
          skill be affected by the colour of the pieces he manipulates.
          One colour is as good as another for practical purposes,
          unless it be of such a bright and flaming nature as to dazzle
          the eyes; and although the position of the forces, especially
          as regards castling, differs slightly according to the colour
          of the pieces you are playing, yet a player who claims any
          reputation for himself ought to have mastered the geography of
          the board as to be indifferent whether his men are black or
          white. This excuse, moreover, is based upon no reasonable
          grounds. You accustom yourself to do what you ought not to do.
          You acquire a bad habit; a habit which you must know will some
          time or other prove inconvenient to yourself or your opponent;
          and then you plead that habit as a reason why your bad play
          ought to be excused, or your opponent’s merit in winning be
          depreciated. Surely such an argument is illogical, such a
          contention unfair. The remedy for this evil habit is simple
          and easy. Play as much with the black as with the white men.
          Be just even to all colours. Observe as little distinction
          between the colour of chess pieces as that of men in your
          practical treatment of them.</p>
        <p>A funny, but by no means stupid, excuse for playing badly was
          lately made by a young provincial friend of mine. He visited a
          club where I happened to be present, and sat down to encounter
          a fifth-class player. After the fight had lasted some time, I
          sauntered up to the board and asked my young friend how he was
          getting on. “Oh”, said he, “very badly. I cannot play with
          these pieces, they are so unlike those to which I am
          accustomed; they are horrible.” “What”, enquired I, “is the
          matter with them?” “Well”, replied he, “several of the pieces,
          especially the kings and queens, are too like one another;
          they are not sufficiently distinguished.” “True”, I rejoined,
          “but they are quite as distinguished as the players.”</p>
        <p>An old friend asked me the other day, “Have you never
          yourself made excuses for losing games?” In answer to this
          question I may say I never, well, hardly ever, make excuses,
          but I sometimes assign reasons. Here is one. A long time ago I
          accidentally lost a game in this way. My opponent had a cruel
          taste for music, and manifested it in a manner peculiarly
          disagreeable to me. Throughout the whole contest he never
          ceased to hum, except when he began to beat time with his
          finger on the board – in other words, to drum. Now, being
          lively in my disposition, and not unmusical in my taste, my
          friend’s noisy performances irritated my nerves and distracted
          my attention. That hum-drum game was more than I could bear
          and, consequently, I lost it.</p>
        <p>The celebrated Agamemnon has certainly won some games of me,
          not so much by his superior skill as by hovering with his hand
          over the pieces and never moving the piece he plays to any
          definite square, so that a good portion of my time is wasted
          in watching to see what piece he has touched and in
          re-adjusting the pieces when he has completed his move.</p>
        <p>A novel and ingenious excuse was lately given by Ajax for
          losing a match game to Hector. “He bothered me thus: every
          time I made a move he pulled out a large black note-book,
          wherein he recorded my move before making his own. That black
          note-book was to me what the great black horse that would
          follow, or might have followed, Mr Pickwick was to him - a <i>bête








            noire</i>; it disconcerted my thoughts, it struck terror
          into my heart.”</p>
        <p>Some persons fairly attribute their bad moves to the light.
          They cannot play if they happen to have the sun in their eyes.
          Others cannot play with their backs to the light. Some persons
          are injuriously affected by gas, and I know at least one
          first-class player who can play about a pawn and move stronger
          when he has the sunlight. I know several players who find it
          impossible to do justice to their powers if they have to play
          in a room ill-ventilated or over-heated. There is no doubt
          that in many cases such a condition of things is calculated to
          dim the vision and cloud the brain. It has always seemed
          marvellous to me how some players can play as well in a
          vitiated as in a pure atmosphere. I remember encountering
          Menelaus about three years ago. We played in a small room lit
          by a large gaselier and in presence of about eight spectators,
          who were all smoking, as also was my opponent. Menelaus wore a
          top coat and, as well as I remember, a muffler. Frequently I
          rushed out of the room to catch a mouthful of fresh air,
          purposely leaving the door open behind me; but as I observed
          that my opponent always rose to shut it, I was obliged to
          relinquish this mode of obtaining relief. Now in such cases as
          those I have enumerated, satisfactory causes can be assigned
          for making bad moves, but still I hold that the wisest course
          for a man to adopt when defeated is to hold his tongue and
          look pleasant. This course is no doubt trying to the temper,
          as an opponent is often unduly exultant over a victory in
          which he has had auxiliaries of whose existence he has been
          wholly unconscious.’</p>

    <p>Joseph Walter Russell (1849-1931), a controversial figure in his
      time, is largely forgotten today. He was, though, mentioned on
      page 154 of <i>The Unknown Capablanca</i> by D. Hooper and D.
      Brandreth (London, 1975) in connection with a simultaneous
      exhibition given by the Cuban in 1919:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>‘In his third and last display at the City of London Chess Club
        Capablanca did better than before as he had promised; but the
        club had lost its former strength. The secretary, J. Walter
        Russell, was a sick man, suffering from xenophobia; he had
        expelled many talented players and not until 1927 were
        foreigners again permitted to join. A few years later this
        famous club faded away.’</p>

    <p>Biographical details about Russell appeared on pages 165-166 of
      the May 1929 <i>BCM </i>(where the portrait above was also
      given) and in his obituary on pages 127-129 of the March 1931
      issue. It was reported there that he had joined the City of London
      Chess Club in 1889 and was its honorary secretary from 1895 until
      May 1930. The <i>BCM</i> remarked in 1929: ‘For length of
      service, breadth of ability and depth of devotion Mr Russell’s
      record must be almost without parallel and his name will ever be
      coupled with that of the club he has made so famous.’ His
      obituary, however, also referred to a darker side:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>‘Of course Mr Russell’s best friends will recognize that he had
        the defects of his qualities. His fervent patriotism, his innate
        conservatism and his unquestioning love of the club made him
        rather prejudiced against “foreigners”, people of different
        political views from his, and institutions which appeared to him
        to menace the supremacy of the “City”. He could not help his
        whole-heartedness, and did not care to disguise his feelings,
        especially as he grew older in years. The Great War did much to
        emphasize his strength of convictions, and led him to refusal of
        all compromise. But his name will be remembered, not for such
        matters, much rather for his intense loyalty to what he
        considered the best interests of chess.’</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>To what extent Walter Russell’s services to chess were remembered
      is difficult to say, but some three decades after his death he
      took centre stage in a controversy in the pages of <i>CHESS</i>
      when the magazine published William Winter’s posthumous memoirs.
      From page 29 of the 24 December 1962 issue:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>‘My real chess career began when I joined the City of London
        Chess Club at the age of 15. This was, and had been for many
        years, the leading club in the country, and everybody who had
        any kind of chess aspiration was a member. The club met in
        Grocers Hall Court, off Poultry, and was ruled with a rod of
        iron by its secretary, J. Walter Russell. He was a real despot
        who would brook no kind of opposition, but there is no doubt
        that he did a tremendous amount of good work for the club. Later
        on his jingoistic attitude made him my bitter enemy, but in
        those early days he did everything to encourage me, and
        presented me with the bound volumes of the rare <i>City of
          London Chess Magazine </i>autographed by himself.’</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>And from page 32:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>‘In these war days I did not go much to the City of London
        Club. Russell had already developed the jingoism which
        eventually drove him completely out of his mind, and I was soon
        at loggerheads with him. The first serious breach occurred on
        the question of the naturalized Germans. There was a number of
        these in the club, many of them British citizens since boyhood,
        and as loyal as Russell himself. Nevertheless, to the latter
        everything German was tainted, and a special general meeting of
        the club was called to purge the club of the abomination.
        Together with Scott and most of the younger and stronger players
        I vigorously opposed the expulsion, but Russell had sent out a
        three-line whip to fellow dotards and, by a large majority, the
        naturalized Germans had to go. Among them was the club’s
        president, a man in his 80s, who had been a member for over 50
        years. His expulsion broke his heart. He lived just long enough
        to alter his will, in which he had left the club a large sum of
        money.’</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The president&nbsp; in question was Herman(n) Eschwege.<br>
    </p>
    <p>In subsequent issues the remarks about Russell were discussed by
      readers. On page 212 of <i>CHESS</i>, 20 April 1963 J.Y. Bell (‘I
      joined the City Club in 1901 so I saw something of Russell’) wrote
      that the most regrettable feature of William Winter’s memoirs was
      ‘his venomous attack on Walter Russell, whom I remember as a
      courteous and harmless old gentleman who devoted his life to the
      City of London Chess Club’. On the same page the Editor, B.H.
      Wood, commented: ‘We met Walter Russell personally and found him
      dominating and irascible’. The 25 May 1963 issue of <i>CHESS</i>
      (pages 244-245) had two contrasting views. David Hooper observed
      that ‘Winter, who was trying to earn a living at chess, was
      refused membership of the City of London Chess Club because of his
      political beliefs – a matter of principle not raised by your
      correspondent, Mr A.Y. Bell’, but Russell was defended by R.E.
      Robinson:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>‘I was a member [of the City of London Chess Club] from 1920 to
        its end in 1938 and was honoured by Russell’s friendship. I
        remember the incident of a printer who joined for a short period
        and turned up with dirty hands, and perhaps Russell’s justified
        and outspoken indignation against this man was a pointer towards
        the bad feeling between Russell and Winter. Russell’s great
        services to chess included the organization of the 1899 London
        tournament, the Club’s invitation tournament of 1900, the cable
        matches and the Club’s 75th anniversary tournament in 1927. He
        was generous in financial help to impoverished British masters,
        and I hold a document which shows that he gave £1 to a hard-up
        German master – quite a lot of money 50 years ago. ... All in
        all he was a fine old English gentleman and Winter’s
        uncharitable words were quite unworthy of him.’</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Two general articles on the City of London Chess Club may be
      mentioned here: on pages 1-17 of the January 1893 <i>BCM</i> and
      on pages 9-11 of the <i>Chess Amateur</i>, October 1906. The

      <p>A bibliographical rarity is <i>The Chess Player’s Note Book</i>
        by Rhodes Marriott (Manchester, 1884 and 1901), which is
        essentially a blank score-book. Our copy of the 1901 edition
        belonged to a player who identified himself only by the initials
        ‘J.H.M.’ and whose games included draws against Capablanca and
        Menchik in simultaneous exhibitions in the mid-1930s. The
        decisive clue to identifying ‘J.H.M.’ was his game against
        Capablanca (in Manchester, 1935). As noted on page 75 of the
        February 1935 <i>BCM</i>, on 7 January that year the Cuban
        scored +39 –0 =1. The player who drew was not named, but the
        extensive report on page 4 of the <i>Manchester Evening News</i>,
        8 January 1935 identified Capablanca’s opponent as J.H.
        Mandleberg, ‘who is his host for his Manchester visit’. Below is

          Beurling had already solved several Russian crypto systems in

          insisted on using the Swedish west-coast cable system for
          telephone and telegraphic traffic. Sweden naturally made
          formal protests, but it did mean that Sweden could construct a
          bugging cable to Stockholm. Beurling and Lundqvist understood
          that there was a machine involved, the Siemens

      São Luiz do Maranhão, he used his entire collection of sentences,
      to loud applause. The next day he read a report in the local
      newspaper that he had thanked the audience in Spanish.</p>

    <p>C.N. 4003 referred to a report that Zukertort had won a game in
      Bradford against Mark Dawson wherein he specified the pawn with
      which he would compel his opponent to mate him. Paul Valois
      (Leeds, England) has now found that the game was mentioned,

      November 1884. Zukertort obliged Black to mate with his pawn at
      a7.</p>

      <p>Below is the report by ‘J.A.S.’ (Jakob Adolf Seitz) on page 220
        of <i>CHESS</i>, 28 April 1956:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>‘In memory of the tenth anniversary of the death of the late
          world champion Alexander Alekhine, several hundred people –
          more than one would have expected on an icy cold day –
          gathered outside the main entrance to Paris’s famous
          Montparnasse cemetery, just before eleven in the morning of 25
          March 1956.</p>
        <p>Folke Rogard, President of the International Chess
          Federation, was one of the first to arrive. Soon there came a
          strong delegation from the USSR led by grandmaster Ragozin.
          Some unkind tongues suggested that the Russian chessplayers
          were the main attraction of the ceremony to many locals; and
          certainly Smyslov, Keres, Bronstein, Geller, Petrosian and
          others were energetically pestered for autographs.</p>
        <p>At 11 a.m., which was said to have been the hour of
          Alekhine’s death, the crowd moved to the monument.</p>
        <p>We found that Abraham Baratz, a gifted sculptor, many times
          chess champion of Paris in his younger days, had chiselled a
          statue of Alekhine in his youth sitting at a chess board. All
          in white marble; and it was to be noted that his chessmen were
          not Staunton, but French, in type.</p>
        <p>The base of the tumulus was a huge chessboard itself, though
          few noticed it at the time, so completely was it covered by
          wreaths, of which the Soviet delegation’s was the biggest.
          Beneath the sculpture appeared first Alekhine’s name in his
          native Russian characters, then the inscription “<i>Alexandre
            Alekhine, génie des échecs de Russie et de France, 1
            novembre 1891 – 25 mars 1946</i>” and below “<i>Grace
            Alekhine née Wishar 1876-1956</i>”.</p>
        <p>On the socle of the tumulus was an announcement that the
          monument had been erected on 25 March 1956 by the
          International Chess Federation. The names of Rogard (Sweden),
          Ragozin, Berman (France), Botvinnik (who was not present),
          Count dal Verme (Italy) and others followed.</p>
        <p>Among French chessplayers present were Dr Bernstein, C.
          Boutteville (present French champion), Biscay, Halberstadt,
          Mme Chaudé de Silans, Muffang, Ségal and others. Edmond Lancel
          had come from Brussels. Rogard gave a brief address in French,
          Ragozin another in officially translated Russian. Alekhine’s
          son responded, followed by Mme Isnard, a daughter of
          Alekhine’s last wife. The chessplayers then repaired to a
          famous restaurant, where a hundred anecdotes about Alekhine
          were exchanged. Not one word about this impressive ceremony
          did I find in any of the French newspapers – a sad commentary
          on the place of chess in France today.’</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Confusion with the dates may be noted. Firstly, the date on the
        tombstone was ‘1 November 1892’, not 1891 (although the correct
        date of Alekhine’s birth is 31 October 1892). The ‘1891’ was
        apparently Seitz’s error and not a misprint by <i>CHESS</i>,
        because it also occurred in a similar report by Seitz on page 83
        of the April 1956 <i>Schweizerische Schachzeitung</i>. The
        latter magazine, moreover, quoted Alekhine’s death-date on the
        tombstone as ‘25 March 1956’, instead of 25 March 1946, although
        the latter too was wrong. As chronicled in C.N. 3086, Alekhine
        was found dead in the <font color="#000000">Hotel do Parque,
          Estoril</font> on the morning of 24 March 1946.</p>
